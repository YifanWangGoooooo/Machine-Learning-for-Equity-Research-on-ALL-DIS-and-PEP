       "[('Hollywood Calls the Russo Brothers When It’s Time to Build a New Universe',\n",
       "  '2021-07-23',\n",
       "  'Joe and Anthony Russo went from making movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe to creating their own worlds. Amazon’s Citadel will test their vision.Film directors Joe and Anthony Russo.Before Joe and Anthony Russo were dreaming up film and TV franchises, they were part of the biggest one. The brothers directed two Captain America movies and two Avengers films, installments in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which together took in almost $7 billion in ticket sales. Now they’re the guys industry executives turn to when they want to create a cinematic universe of their own.Throughout most of the history of Hollywood, franchises were born out of success. The studios ordered up sequels only after a TV show or movie became a hit. But the money-minting capabilities of Marvel, which stitches together interlocking stories across some 20 movies so far, has inspired Hollywood to rethink its approach. “The blockbuster gave way to the franchise play,” says Donna Langley, the chairman of Universal Filmed Entertainment, which has hired the Russos to make a sci-fi franchise.Now, the surge of at-home streaming has made cohesive film worlds even more appealing. Reliable franchises can help such services as Amazon Prime Video, Disney+, HBO Max, Netflix, and Peacock retain customers who might otherwise cancel at any time.Ten highest-grossing films, international box officeData: The NumbersIn 2019, the head of Amazon Studios, Jennifer Salke, wanted to create a U.S.-based series that would go on to splinter into related shows, each set in a different foreign country. For help, she called the Russos, whom she’d first met two decades ago when they were directing TV sitcoms.The Russos got to work creating an extensive document for Salke, outlining in sweeping strokes the parameters of Citadel, a global spy thriller. They also brought on Midnight Radio, a writing team with whom they have a close relationship, to serve as the showrunners and “creative gatekeepers”—a Russo term for the people overseeing the creation of the mythology of the universe.Even by the elevated standards of modern TV, Citadel is a big swing. Amazon is spending $165 million on the first seven episodes of the show, which will debut in 2022 and star Priyanka Chopra Jonas and Richard Madden. Before a single episode has aired, it’s already hired writers to develop spinoff series set in Brazil, France, India, Italy, and Mexico.Citadel is one of a half-dozen or so universe-creation projects that the Russos’ company, AGBO, is developing. Last year, AGBO produced Extraction, an action flick starring Chris Hemsworth that quickly became the most-watched original movie in Netflix’s history. Afterward, the streaming giant commissioned AGBO to begin work on a series of follow-up films. For Universal, AGBO is developing both a movie and a TV series based on the comic The Electric State. For Amazon, in addition to Citadel, they’re making an adaptation of the comic Grimjack.“We have a really uniquely accomplished creative team that can not only imagine but also execute at the greatest scale and scope,” says Jason Bergsman, AGBO’s chief executive officer. “Our goal is to launch new franchises that drive audience engagement for years to come that extend across film and TV, as well as digital and interactive experiences.”Born and raised in Cleveland, Joe, 50, and Anthony, 51, didn’t start off as franchise-building specialists. Their first movie, Pieces, was a small-scale comedy that premiered in 1997 at the Slamdance Film Festival, an event created by filmmakers who were rejected from Sundance. The Russos’ second project was a heist movie that led to work in TV, most notably on the comedies Arrested Development and Community. It was something of a surprise When Marvel Studios hired them to direct Captain America: Winter Soldier, the second film in the growing franchise, since they’d never made a movie on a similar scale.The movie, which premiered in 2014, grossed more than $714 million worldwide. Soon after, the Russos formed AGBO. They picked the name by closing their eyes and pointing to a random listing in the Cleveland phone book. They recruited their sister, Angela Russo-Otstot, who now oversees creative. And they brought on Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, the writers of Winter Soldier, to join their nascent company. “I don’t know many companies that have a screenwriting team as owners and as long-term committed partners,” says Bergsman.Since its formation, AGBO has turned franchise creation into a kind of science. For each project, AGBO taps a writer to be the lead creator of the emerging world. The writer then works with AGBO’s team to develop the so-called bible, a richly detailed outline of a fictional universe, including characters, settings, and plotlines that serve as the foundation of future works in the project. That in turn leads to a draft of the first script.A couple of years ago, the Russos bought the rights to adapt popular anime series Battle of the Planets. They then hired F9 screenwriter Daniel Casey to be the project’s creative gatekeeper. Now he’s writing the first draft of the script and sketching out a TV series that could complement and intersect with it. Meanwhile, AGBO is also using material from the bible on what could eventually become a serialized podcast. “It’s super helpful to have a road map beforehand,” says Markus. “You don’t have to be married to it.”Markus and McFeely have spent most of this year working on drafts of Electric State, a feature adaptation of a narrative art book by Swedish conceptual artist Simon Stalenhag, set in an alternate version of the U.S. They’re planning a companion TV show, which is supposed to premiere on the streaming service Peacock, with the hope that audiences see the Electric State movie in a theater, then go home and watch the spinoff streaming series.In the meantime, the Russos are shooting Gray Man, one of their potential franchises for Netflix, a spy thriller about a CIA operative who is betrayed. The movie, filming this summer in Europe, is focused on the spies. But the organization lends itself to deeper exploration (and a potential TV series or video game). “These aren’t stories you can conceive overnight,” says Joe Russo. “It takes a lot of patience and discipline.”AGBO borrows from the Marvel playbook, Russo says, but not too much. Marvel creator “Kevin Feige used to always say, ‘Well, we can’t make the next one until we make this one a success,’\\u2009” Russo says. “But conversely, if you aren’t planning for it from the start, you make a movie, the movie is successful, and you’ve lost momentum.”'),\n",

       "  '2021-06-24',\n",
       "  'The animated series from Kenya is meant to be both educational and entertaining.Super Sema episodes and clips have been viewed some 15 million times on YouTube.Super Sema features all the tropes typical of a superhero story—a greedy villain, a futuristic setting, and a do-good warrior who saves the day. But there are a few key differences: The hero is a 10-year-old girl from a village in Africa, and to defeat the robot villain and his minions, she taps into courage and empathy—not superhuman strength—as well as her understanding of science, technology, and the arts.The series is the creation of Kukua Education Ltd., a startup in Nairobi that aims to build the first media franchise based on an African animated superhero. On YouTube, the 20 episodes plus extras featuring dance instruction, science experiments, and craft-making have garnered 15 million views—“massive, for a new channel,” says Kukua’s founder and chief executive officer, Lucrezia Bisignani. The company expects to close a second round of venture capital financing in July and is working on Season 2, due to start in December.Kukua, which means “to grow” in Swahili, says its combination of fun and learning can yield an online and offline franchise that appeals to children anywhere. Riding a global wave of interest in Afro-futuristic stories triggered by Disney’s Black Panther, the all-female team of executives has big plans for Sema: toys, costumes, comic books, virtual- and augmented-reality learning experiences, and perhaps even a Semaland theme park. “We want to be the Mickey Mouse of Africa, but with a strong learning component,” says Vanessa Ford, Kukua’s chief operating officer and executive producer.Hits such as Black Panther, Crazy Rich Asians, and Coco have shown Hollywood that stories featuring diverse characters set outside the U.S. or Europe are bankable, triggering a slew of African animated series. Mama K’s Team 4 by Triggerfish Animation Studios in Cape Town, about four teenage girls fighting evil in a futuristic Lusaka, is scheduled to premier next year on Netflix. Walt Disney Co. has at least three such shows in the works, including Kizazi Moto: Generation Fire, a sci-fi fantasy to stream on Disney+ next year. And YouTube Originals, which is backing Super Sema, will release Supa Strikas: Rookie Season, a series about a fictional pan-African soccer team. “The Africa market is so vibrant right now,” says Nadine Zylstra, who oversees family programming at YouTube Originals. “Hearing these pitches from young African talent, there is definitely the feeling that this is the generation that can use these digital tools to share their voice with the world.”Black Panther was released just as Kukua was developing Super Sema and seeking financing in 2018, and its success convinced investors of the Kenyan series’ international appeal, helping the company raise $2.5 million. Then, as media giants sought to boost the diversity of their storytelling in response to the Black Lives Matter movement, Kukua landed its distribution agreement with YouTube. “There was a whole global awakening and new buzz around diverse properties,” Ford says.Lupita Nyong’o, the Kenyan-Mexican actor who played Nakia in Black Panther, owns a stake in the company, serves as executive producer of Super Sema, and has brought her star power to the series by providing the voice of the tree that is Sema’s mother figure. The five-minute episodes weave in Kenyan cultural references such as mandazi—a traditional snack of fried dough—and Swahili sayings like Polepole ndio mwendo (“Slowly, slowly wins the day”). In one episode, the robot villain cuts down the forest to build a castle. Sema thwarts him with a drone and a special substance to replant the trees and trap him, showing off her critical thinking and grit while highlighting for young viewers the dangers of deforestation.Kukua is incorporated in London, but most of its 11 employees are in Nairobi, where it did the voicing, music, and sound work for the first season of Super Sema. At the company’s offices in a townhouse complex in western Nairobi, the walls are plastered with framed Super Sema stills, storyboards, and photographs of notable women of color such as Kamala Harris and Oprah Winfrey. To keep the content topical and educational, the team holds brainstorming sessions with child behavioral experts, parents, teachers, and environmentalists. “The episodes are informed by values that people would like to see in their own children,” says Clara Njeru, Kukua’s chief product officer.Although Bisignani is White and was raised in Rome, she traveled widely in Africa when she was young as her parents sought to instill a global mindset in their children. She has since visited most countries on the continent and has long been captivated by its energy and entrepreneurial culture. After graduating from university, she realized media and mobile technology could help narrow the educational gap between Europe and Africa and dispel what she says is the flawed view of the region as impoverished, diseased, and corrupt. “It’s this thriving continent with 1.2 billion people, with a billion new kids being born over the next 30 years,” she says. “It’s incredible, and it’s never portrayed.”'),\n",

       "  '2021-06-10',\n",
       "  'Lured south by sunshine, golf, and money, the former president’s allies and hangers-on have formed an alternate universe that revolves around Mar-a-Lago.Former President Donald Trump’s home, Mar-a-Lago.Since he left Washington in turmoil in January, Donald Trump has spent the bulk of his brief, contentious post-presidency holed up in what Karl Rove calls his “Fortress of Solitude”—Mar‑a‑Lago, his private club in Palm Beach. It’s an odd sort of isolation: Although he’s largely cut off from the outside world, Trump is hardly alone.Tossed from the White House, banished from Facebook and Twitter, Trump has never seemed more distant from public consciousness. But while he can’t broadcast out, those same platforms offer a surprisingly intimate glimpse into his new life, thanks to the prolific posting of the club’s guests. At every moment of his day, Trump is bathed in adulation. When he enters the dining room, people stand and applaud. When he returns from golf, he’s met with squeals and selfie requests. When he leaves Mar-a-Lago, he often encounters flag-waving throngs organized by Willy Guardiola, a former professional harmonica player and anti-abortion activist who runs weekly pro-Trump rallies in Palm Beach. “Give me four hours and I can pull together 500 people,” Guardiola says. Trump recently invited the self-proclaimed “biggest Trump supporter in the country” for a private consultation at his club.In this gilded Biosphere, Trump encounters no one who isn’t vocally gratified by his presence. When he speaks extemporaneously, so many guests post footage that you can watch the same weird scene unfold from multiple vantage points, like the Japanese film Rashomon. Trump seems so comfortable, the journalist and Instagram sleuth Ashley Feinberg has noted, that he’s taken to wearing the same outfit for days on end. Blue slacks, white golf shirt, and red MAGA cap are to the former president what the black Mao suit is to his old frenemy Kim Jong Un. Club members say his new lifestyle agrees with him. “Presidents when they finish always look so much older,” says Thomas Peterffy, the billionaire founder of Interactive Brokers LLC, who lives three doors down from Mar-a-Lago. “Not true for Trump.”He’ll show up to anything. In recent weeks, Trump has popped into engagement parties and memorial services. A Mar-a-Lago member who recently attended a club gathering for a deceased friend was surprised when Trump sauntered in to deliver remarks and then hung around, apparently enjoying himself. This insular feedback loop, amplified by the worshipful validation he gets for doing Newsmax or OAN TV hits, doesn’t appear likely to diminish as he settles into his New Jersey golf club for the summer and prepares to resume his trademark rallies. “Donald Trump needs the adulation of the crowd the way you or I need oxygen to breathe,” says Michael Cohen, his estranged former lawyer. By all accounts, Trump’s life after the White House doesn’t resemble that of a typical ex-president so much as a foreign monarch cast into exile—like Napoleon at Elba, but with golf and a bigger buffet.When Trump left Washington, people wondered whether he’d maintain his iron grip on the Republican Party or dwindle into colorful insignificance, like Sarah Palin. Now we know: Trump isn’t dwindling. As shown by the defenestration of Representative Liz Cheney, the blocking of a Jan. 6 commission in Congress, and the wave of new voter restrictions Republicans across the country are pushing in the name of “election integrity,” Trump’s grip is stronger than ever. He’s used it to force elected Republicans to bend to his warped version of reality.Anyone who refuses risks banishment. As a recent trip to Florida revealed, every segment of the party—activists, donors, ex-staffers, local pols—has come to accommodate and, to one degree or another, depend on this reality. Together, these party actors form a power structure that extends and reinforces Trump’s primacy, even as he faces the looming threat (real, not fake) of indictment in New York’s criminal investigation of his business empire. If Trump feels entitled to dominate the GOP as if he were still president, it may be because so many of the same people still surround him and treat him as if he is. Instead of moving beyond Trump, much of the party moved to Florida to join him.Some components of Trump World were already waiting for him there. Just south of Mar‑a‑Lago in Boca Raton, Newsmax, the tiny right-wing cable channel that blew past Fox News in the race to tout Trump’s election conspiracies—earning a defamation suit from a Dominion Voting Systems employee (dropped after Newsmax apologized)—pumps out a steady stream of Trump-friendly propaganda. In Fort Lauderdale, his ex-campaign manager Brad Parscale’s new firm, Campaign Nucleus, services Trump’s political operations. Parscale, who retreated to Florida after Trump fired him from the reelection campaign, suggested that his old boss establish permanent residency with a pitch that went beyond golf and sunshine. “You’ve got a great governor who’s friendly to conservatives, a fair conservative judicial system, low taxes, and great airports,” Parscale says.When Trump ventured south, a stream of family members (literal and figurative) followed. Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner bought a $32 million waterfront lot in Miami from the Latin crooner Julio Iglesias and enrolled their kids at a nearby Jewish day school. Donald Trump Jr. and his girlfriend, Kimberly Guilfoyle, bought a $9.7 million mansion in Jupiter, Fla. In December, Sean Hannity sold his penthouse not far from former House speaker—and Trump critic—John Boehner’s place along the Gulf of Mexico and bought a $5.3 million seaside home two miles from Mar-a-Lago, symbolically swapping the Boehner Coast for the Trump Coast. Hannity’s Fox News colleague Neil Cavuto joined him, buying a $7.5 million place nearby. “Think about how utterly bizarre that is,” says Eddie Vale, a Democratic strategist. “It’s like if Rachel Maddow and the Pod Save America guys all bought condos in Chicago because they wanted to be close to Barack Obama.”For Republicans, going to Florida carries added delight because it lets them do something almost as thrilling as being close to Trump: own the libs. Every person interviewed for this story mentioned, without prompting, how well the “Free State of Florida” has fared in flouting Covid-19 restrictions under its Trump-endorsed Republican governor, Ron DeSantis. “You’ve got no masks, no lockdowns, good restaurants, and great beaches,” says Andy Surabian, a former Trump official. “Trump being there is a cherry on top.”Because the state mostly remained open during the crisis, it became a haven for Republicans seeking to gather and raise money. This activity was helped along by the procession of supplicants, led by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, arriving at Mar-a-Lago to bend the knee and try to curry favor with the boss. The stampede grew larger when the Conservative Political Action Conference, traditionally held outside Washington, moved to Orlando in February, drawing many of the 2024 Republican presidential hopefuls, top consultants, and big donors. Whether they were setting up residency like Trump, riding out the winter in the sun, or just swinging through for a business trip, just about every Republican punched a ticket to Florida. “It’s crazy,” says Sean Spicer, the former White House press secretary. “It’s a full-on migration.”One of the new arrivals is Hogan Gidley, a former White House spokesman. “It’s the amenities, the beaches, the weather, the open spaces,” he says, peering through his Oakleys as he spins Florida’s emergence as the center of the GOP universe. “It’s also a lot of people converging on this state with deep pockets and a deep concern for the future of the country.”Tanned and shirtless, wearing an Ole Miss baseball cap flipped backward, Gidley is sipping a $16 virgin berry spritzer at the poolside bar at the Breakers, the luxury Palm Beach resort. Like so many professional Republicans, he’s on message because he has to be. He’s one of many Trump staffers who hasn’t fallen far from the tree. He’s come to Florida, from his home in D.C., to sweet-talk donors at a conservative gathering in Naples—on the other side of the state—about his new nonprofit, the Voter Protection Alliance, which aims to advance the Trumpian cause of “going into states and making sure the legislature is protecting every legally cast vote.” But he’s detoured through Palm Beach, taking up temporary residence in the beach-side home of a local socialite, because if you’re a made man in the land of Trump, well, why wouldn’t you?Veterans of Trump’s White House have had a famously hard time landing the kind of high-powered corporate gigs at places like Amazon, McDonald’s, and Uber that awaited top officials from the previous administration. Many struggle to get any private-sector job at all, especially after the Capitol insurrection. Some, like former cabinet secretary Ben Carson and senior adviser Stephen Miller, have joined Gidley in starting their own organizations, falling back on their chief credential and remaining tightly locked in Trump’s orbit. In this way, Trump functions as his own economy, providing livelihoods for his former aides. In exchange, they trumpet his gospel of stolen elections and Democratic conspiracies.“They have nowhere else to go, these people,” says Sam Nunberg, an early Trump campaign aide who’s been fully deprogrammed and left politics a few years ago. “What else are they going to do?”Traveling among the Florida Trumpers, however, it’s apparent money isn’t the only draw. A powerful psychological gratification comes with living free of censure among one’s own kind—with being celebrated for the very thing that makes you toxic in bluer environs. Palm Beach offers a Trump-friendly social circuit from morning till night: brunch at Le Bilboquet or Ta-boo; a late lunch, perhaps with a prospective donor, at the Breakers; dinner and selfies on the Mar-a-Lago patio; watermelon martinis at Buccan and more late-night fun at the Colony Hotel. You’re in for an especially good time if, like Gidley, you spent a lot of time on TV talking up Trump, and if—again like Gidley—your affect is “amiable Southerner” rather than, say, “bullet-headed nativist.”When he isn’t wooing Florida grandees or touting Trump on Fox News, Gidley has been modeling designer loafers on Instagram with ex-Queer Eye host Carson Kressley and showing up in double-breasted Ralph Lauren suits on the arm of local socialites in Palm Beach magazines (sample headline: “Party Animals Return to Palm Beach to Support Peggy Adams Animal Rescue League”). Along the Trump Coast, his credentials guarantee a certain celebrity. As Comic-Con does for actors past their prime, South Florida offers hardcore Trump fans a way to indulge their nostalgia and fawn over their favorite characters from the extended Trump Universe. Even bit players are big attractions. Gidley was looking forward to his next gig as a celebrity guest at a Memorial Day Trump boat parade in Jupiter.Spicer, who now hosts a Newsmax show, has the most Florida-appropriate take on the Republican exodus to what might be called Greater Mar-a-Lago. “It’s like Disney World—that’s just one ride at the amusement park,” says Spicer, a regular visitor. “I can shoot the show in Boca, go to see the president, go to a fundraiser, and do eight other things while I’m down there. There’s a lot of attractions.”Gidley says that’s a big reason Florida’s appeal has endured. “A lot of locals tell me the season has extended quite a bit because of Trump bringing a spotlight to Palm Beach,” he says. “People are still here, networking and extending their projects.” He grins. “And you never take your line out of the water while the fish are still biting.”Trump’s dominance of the GOP isn’t driven only by opportunistic tourists and transplants. He’s embedded himself deep into the fabric of local politics, in South Florida and elsewhere. Republicans have grown to depend on him, as much in his post-presidency as when he lived in the White House.Joe Budd’s awakening came even before Trump was the Republican nominee. It was March 15, 2016, and Budd, a Palm Beach County state committeeman, watched in awe as Trump smoked two of Florida’s favorite sons, Senator Marco Rubio and ex-Governor Jeb Bush, to win the state’s presidential primary.It wasn’t the victory that most impressed Budd. It was the charge Trump put into Florida voters—turnout in Palm Beach County shot up 52% over 2012. Budd, a Boca Raton financial planner, decided he couldn’t risk letting this electricity fizzle. He joined the Trump campaign, then started Club 45 USA, an outfit designed to keep Trump’s fans involved in local politics and “support future endeavors of Donald Trump!” as its website puts it. “It all stemmed from that primary,” says Budd. “I’m thinking, ‘Who are these 52%, and how do I keep them engaged?’\\u200a”The answer to those questions turned out to be “Trump fans” and “Donald Trump.” So long as he was driving the national political drama, Republican voters stayed involved and engaged, even when Trump wasn’t on the ballot. His endorsement of DeSantis sealed the Florida governor’s race in 2018. And of course, he steamrolled Joe Biden in Florida last November, winning the state by almost 400,000 votes.But in March, something happened that jarred Budd and other local Republican leaders. Palm Beach County held its municipal elections—and this time, practically nobody showed up. “It was alarming,” Budd says. “People just didn’t go out and vote.”Budd thinks he knows why. “There was no draw,” he says. “They were discouraged that there was obviously nothing [on the ballot] to do with the president.” He suspects that the post-Jan. 6 hangover and the intraparty bickering over Cheney’s leadership post in the House further dampened Republican enthusiasm.One of the changes Budd has witnessed in local politics over the past several years is the gradual eclipse by the Trump faction of the power centers that once made up Florida’s Republican coalition. “Back in 2016, Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, and even Rick Scott would have all had presidential aspirations and represented three different wings of the party,” he says. But all were pale pastels compared to Trump’s bold color. “Suddenly, there’s a fourth wing and it’s wrested full control of the party, relegating Jeb Bush Republicans to the past.”That same dynamic is unfolding in Republican circles across the country. In Texas, Jeb Bush’s son, George P. Bush, just launched a campaign for attorney general. But being a scion of the Bush family is no longer a winning credential, even in the home of the Bush dynasty. To broadcast his allegiance to the new order, the younger Bush performed a remarkable act of abasement, producing beer koozies that depict him shaking hands with Trump and feature this quote: “\\u200a‘This is the only Bush that likes me! This is the Bush that got it right. I like him.’—DONALD J. TRUMP.”Budd’s suspicion about what ails his party and how to fix it gained credence shortly after the disappointing municipal elections, when Club 45—now devoted to reelecting DeSantis next year—started up again. He booked a Trump-friendly roster of speakers, including conservative provocateur James O’Keefe and General Michael Flynn, Trump’s national security adviser, who recently made headlines for suggesting the U.S. military should stage a coup. The crowds came rushing back. “Flynn tickets sold out in 15 minutes,” he says.To Budd, the lesson is clear: The party needs Trump and there’s no two ways about it. His experience in Palm Beach backs up South Carolina GOP Senator Lindsey Graham’s assertion, “If you tried to run him out of the party, he’d take half the party with him.”The enduring hope of Republicans who loathe Trump and wish to move on is that the party’s major donors, whose support of Trump was always instrumental, will finally shut him out of power now that he’s gone from the White House. When Republicans have this fantasy, they’re imagining donors like Thomas Peterffy, the Interactive Brokers founder and Palm Beach resident.“I did not support Trump until he became the Republican nominee,” says Peterffy. “I didn’t vote for him in the primaries. I am actually not a Trump fan at all. I hope he won’t run again.”Peterffy, 76, may sound like a #NeverTrumper. In fact, he’s the furthest thing from it—he donated $250,000 to Trump’s reelection effort. Over an al fresco lunch of cold asparagus soup at the Trump hot spot Le Bilboquet, Peterffy, an émigré from socialist Hungary who amassed a $22 billion fortune, laid out the cold logic of his thinking.“Ideologically,” he says, “I am very committed to antisocialism, anticollectivism, because I grew up with it. I understand what it is and what it inevitably leads to, and I will do whatever I can to try to get this country to not end up there.”In 2012, when President Obama was running for reelection, Peterffy spent $10 million on ads he narrated himself warning that Obama was a socialist menace. In 2016 the specter of Hillary Clinton was enough to tilt him, reluctantly, toward Trump. In business, as in politics, Peterffy’s operating mode is a kind of hyperrational efficiency. Despite his distaste for Trump, he’s a member of Mar-a-Lago: “I live three houses away. It’s very convenient for business lunches. Certainly, the people who are more refined go to other clubs.”Peterffy has a tragic view of the Republican Party (“completely adrift”), which makes the threat he perceives in Biden and the Democrats all the more scary. In May, driven partly by the prospect of runaway inflation, Interactive Brokers began offering spot gold futures, including the ability for customers to take physical delivery of their gold positions. “It was my idea,” Peterffy says. He thinks the spending binges under Trump and Biden will “absolutely” lead to Weimar-level inflation that will drive investors to gold.That’s enough for Peterffy to wave off what others view as a far graver threat to the country’s well-being: Trump’s refusal to concede the election and the violence that flowed from that stance. “Was there a little speck of hope in him that the crowd at the Capitol would hand him back the presidency? That’s possible,” he says. “But I do not believe that he premeditated the whole thing. If somebody told me that he did, I would be stunned and would be very, very upset. But I don’t think he did. I think it was spontaneous.” Nor does he believe Trump is dangerous. “He’s more childish than dangerous,” Peterffy says, with a laugh. “He’s going to kick me out of Mar-a-Lago, heh, heh!”Most Republicans have a favorite candidate they’re hoping runs for president in 2024. For many, it isn’t Trump, because they don’t believe he can win. Peterffy is eyeing DeSantis, Mike Pompeo, and Tucker Carlson (“That would be interesting, no?”). But he accepts Trump’s high-profile role for the same reason that Budd, Gidley, and so many Republicans do: He believes it’s necessary for Republicans to regain power. “I think [Republicans] believe that for ’22, it is important Trump be active because he can bring in a lot of voters,” he says. “What they’re trying to do is elect a sufficient number of Republicans to get the House back.”In this view, Trump—like a business lunch at a tacky club—is a practical necessity. Peterffy-the-ideologist can rationalize the party’s indulgence of Trump as a bulwark against socialism. But Peterffy-the-Mar-a-Lago-member has an up-close view of the guy, and, well, it gives him pause. “It’s such a screwy thing, because Trump can also screw it all up,” he points out. “We lost the Georgia [Senate] elections because he wasn’t down there to campaign.”And that’s the catch. Trump is a uniquely unreliable ally, whose main source of power isn’t that he can attract a majority coalition to a GOP that’s lost the popular vote in seven of the last eight presidential elections; it’s that, on a whim, he can deny them the voters who have turned out, and will need to do so again for Republicans to reclaim power.For all Republicans’ certainty about his instrumental value next year, no one has a convincing story about how the party will choose a successor and gracefully usher Trump from center stage once his usefulness has expired.

I think falling into that role is something he’s going to find satisfying. To be the kingmaker, but not have to be the king, I think is going to be OK with him.”Even Guardiola, Trump’s flag marshal, has a roving eye: “A ticket of DeSantis and Tim Scott would be unbeatable.”Peterffy, too, has no answer for how Republicans can rid themselves of Trump before 2024. “I am most hopeful that he is going to give up his hold on the party,” he says. That is, voluntarily.Saying it out loud underscores just how implausible it is. Trump is endlessly feted and indulged by all who surround him. He’s vanquished his enemies. In Republican circles, he’s more powerful than ever. If they win next year, he’ll get the credit—and the attention that comes with it. Would Trump, at that point, choose to quietly recede? Or would he do exactly the opposite?Peterffy ponders this for a moment. He frowns. Finally, he puts down his spoon and throws up his hands. “I have to admit, there is rationality to that view,” he says with a deep sigh and a chuckle. “I just really don’t like it!” '),\n",

       "  'There’s a need for fresh material as giant media companies cut out traditional distribution partners and take their content directly to viewers.On the set of Sky’s action-crime series Gangs of London.On a nondescript road on the northern outskirts of London, a TV and film factory the size of 17 soccer fields is under construction. But while the 14 soundproof hangars and sprawling post-production facilities of the Elstree studio complex are being tailor-made to let U.K. broadcaster Sky create worlds of make-believe, the massive facility has a mission that’s all too real: keeping Europe’s biggest pay-TV company relevant in the face of Netflix Inc.’s global barrage of bingeable content.Netflix doubled U.K. investment to $1 billion in 2020 and expects even more this year, when Sky (a unit of Comcast Corp. since 2018) will boost spending on original TV and film content by 50%, feeding an arms race for talent and production space. Netflix has practically taken over another major English facility, the historic Shepperton Studios, where owner Pinewood Group Ltd. plans to add 22 soundstages in the biggest-ever expansion of stage space in the U.K. Sky is fighting back by hiking annual spending on original content to £1 billion ($1.4 billion) by mid-decade—double the level in 2018—with half of its output to be made in-house rather than commissioned from third parties.By date announcedData: Ampere AnalysisIt’s a response to the stagnation of Europe’s pay-TV industry, and a realization that Sky’s traditional supply of hit U.S. shows is coming under threat as giant media companies cut out distribution partners and take content directly to viewers via their own streaming platforms.The merger of AT&T Inc.’s WarnerMedia and Discovery Inc. announced in May underscores the danger to Sky. It could prompt Warner to accelerate the launch of its HBO Max streaming service in Europe. Until now, the companies needed each other—Sky was Warner’s bridge to many of its European viewers, and Warner was Sky’s source for Game of Thrones, Watchmen, and other major shows. Sky has been promoting the latest Warner titles, including the Friends reunion and Mare of Easttown with Kate Winslet, heavily on billboards and TV, proving they remain a pillar of its offerings. A content partnership with Warner’s HBO—which will expire in the middle of the decade—has helped make Warner the largest contributor to the 100 top-rated shows on Sky’s NOW streaming service, according to Ampere Analysis.The recent decline in Walt Disney Co. content available on Sky’s platforms illustrates what could happen when the Warner partnership lapses. In April, 173 Disney and Fox titles were available on NOW, down from 378 in January 2020, before the European launch of the Disney+ streaming service, data from Ampere show.Sky founder Rupert Murdoch built the company into Europe’s most successful broadcasting franchise by outbidding rivals on rights to top-flight soccer. That approach secured the viewers Sky needed to draw audiences to its other channels, but it was costly: The price of English Premier League soccer rights soared thirtyfold between 1992 and 2016.Former Sky Chief Executive Officer Jeremy Darroch started to pull back from that soccer-dominance-at-any-cost strategy in 2018, when a Premier League rights auction saw prices fall for the first time in 15 years. In late 2019, Sky lost German broadcast rights to the Champions League to billionaire Len Blavatnik’s streaming service DAZN. Then, on March 26, Blavatnik snapped up domestic rights to top-flight soccer in Italy, one of Sky’s biggest markets.Sky has been channeling some of the savings into producing its own entertainment programming. It announced 19 commissioned shows in the first quarter of 2021 alone, 76% of the total for all of 2019, according to Ampere. Sky plans to air 125 original films and shows in the U.K. this year, a 50% increase from 2020. It’s leaned toward big, flashy original programming as it tries to build on recent successes, such as its award-winning HBO co-production Chernobyl, Italian gangster drama Gomorrah, and Sky Germany’s Babylon Berlin. Big-name star projects have included the psychological thriller series The Third Day with Jude Law—the first show Sky has produced totally on its own—and This Sceptered Isle, with Kenneth Branagh playing British Prime Minister Boris Johnson grappling with the first wave of the coronavirus.“A Netflix show made in Italy has to work around the world. A Sky show in Italy has to work in Italy”Sky also wants its shows to be memorable: In the first five minutes of its glossy action-crime series Gangs of London, a man is dangled from the top of a skyscraper by his foot before being set on fire and sent hurtling to the ground. It was Sky’s most watched show last year. The wave of buzzy, star-studded output appears to be working: Nine of the 10 most popular shows on Sky last year were its own commissions instead of U.S. imports.Outgoing Sky Studios CEO Gary Davey says the new productions are designed to appeal to domestic viewers in its main markets: the U.K., Germany, and Italy. Netflix’s investments in countries from France to India to Mexico also have a strong local flavor, but the streaming giant needs to ensure that some of those shows become international hits. “A Netflix show made in Italy has to work around the world,” Davey says. “A Sky show in Italy has to work in Italy.”In January, Comcast Chairman Brian Roberts replaced Sky CEO Darroch with one of the media giant’s own executives, Dana Strong, and so far she’s stuck with the scripted-production drive at the expense of sports.While Sky’s business in Germany has struggled against the country’s free-to-air national broadcasters, the mass cable cord-cutting seen in the U.S. hasn’t hit European pay-TV providers to the same extent, partly because pay TV in Europe is a lot cheaper. American consumers spend $80 to $150 for a TV and broadband cable package, compared to €30 to €45 ($37 to $55) in Europe, according to Richard Cooper at Ampere.Sky is still the unchallenged gatekeeper to 23.4 million households in Europe, forcing Netflix, Amazon, and Disney to strike deals to offer their streaming services via Sky’s set-top box, Sky Q. That gives Sky a rare window on user behavior across competing platforms and data on how viewers react to different story arcs. It also offers subscribers the convenience of a single home entertainment bill, making them less likely to drop Sky itself. As streaming services proliferate, “content is king, but the interface is queen,” says Francois Godard at Enders Analysis.The pandemic hit Sky’s advertising revenue, but it appears to be bouncing back, with Comcast’s European division reporting the strongest first-quarter net subscriber additions in six years. Still, the added competition from the Warner-Discovery marriage and Amazon’s pending purchase of Hollywood studio Metro Goldwyn Mayer could portend a world dominated by global streaming giants, with regional pay-TV services such as Sky becoming outliers. That could encourage Comcast’s Roberts to combine Sky with Comcast’s fast-growing Peacock on-demand platform. “How does Sky fit into Comcast’s global streaming strategy?” asks Ian Whittaker of Liberty Sky Advisors. “This was a question before the Warner-Discovery deal, but it’s even more in focus now.”\\n \\nRead next: Here Are the Ways the Pandemic Changed Hollywood'),\n",

       "  'A viewer’s guide to the future of entertainment, where blockbusters no longer require cinemas, studios make sitcoms again, and more.In the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, things seemed to be going from bad to worse for Hollywood. Studios, already suffering from declining ticket sales, now faced theater and theme park closures, release delays, and production freezes. Television networks, battered by cord cutting, saw sporting events canceled or delayed, depriving them of their most valuable programming.But the chaos also sharpened Hollywood’s attention, forcing it to focus on what consumers want. Streaming services, already a major priority, fast became the only way most people got their film and TV fixes. Netflix Inc. added 26 million customers in the first half of 2020, a record for new subscribers. And so media companies set aside legacy businesses and learned how to stream.Warner Media LLC experimented with dropping TV episodes on its new HBO Max service all at once. Walt Disney Co. announced plans for more TV shows based on its Marvel and Star Wars properties, bolstering its approach of spacing out major releases to maximize Disney+ subscriptions. Universal, Warner Bros., and Disney all canceled plans to release major movies in theaters and put them online instead. News and sports divisions everywhere tailored programming to streaming audiences. And now Amazon is buying MGM.The transition hasn’t been seamless. Some companies introduced services mid-pandemic, asking customers to subscribe based on films and shows that couldn’t be properly marketed with billboards or as coming attractions in theaters. NBCUniversal Media LLC, which had planned to use the Summer Olympics to promote Peacock, instead had to rely on English soccer and reruns of The Office. Warner Media’s introduction of HBO Max was hamstrung by its initial absence from the popular Roku and Fire TV streaming devices and by confusion over how it differed from HBO Now and HBO Go. And, of course, RIP Quibi.Now, though, more than a year into a pandemic, the future of entertainment seems clearer. Pop culture has moved online—for everyone. “My 91-year-old mother is texting me now,” says Tom Bernard, the co-president of Sony Pictures Classics. “A lot of the older generation—people who aren’t teenagers and in their early 20s—the internet has now become the system for communication.”Although no one can say precisely how this will all play out once movie theaters, theme parks, and live events get back in full swing, there are some key ways the entertainment industry has evolved that will change life for you, the viewer.When Godzilla vs. Kong was released this March, it signaled the return of the Hollywood blockbuster. The monster mashup has grossed more than $425 million at the worldwide box office, making it the biggest English-language movie since the pandemic began. But as it was filling theaters to their permitted capacities, Godzilla vs. Kong was also the most popular movie on HBO Max. Warner Media had released it in theaters and online at the same time, continuing its recent break from decades of orthodoxy.Since the days of Jaws and Star Wars, studios have released movies more or less the same way: several months in theaters, followed by home entertainment, be it Betamax, VHS, or DVD. Universal Pictures Ltd. was the first to change things during the pandemic, releasing Trolls World Tour as a $19.99 rental in April 2020. Then Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. followed suit, releasing Scoob! on HBO Max in May. Disney, which made $11.1 billion at the box office in 2019, released the film version of Hamilton directly to Disney+.Data: Motion Picture AssociationNone of the studios offered specifics on the returns they saw from their experimentation, but they clearly liked the results enough to continue. Universal skipped theaters and released The King of Staten Island as a stream over the summer, and Warner Bros. and Disney dropped Wonder Woman 1984 and Soul, respectively, online and in theaters simultaneously in time for Christmas. Warner Bros. then moved to release its entire 2021 slate, including Dune, Space Jam: A New Legacy, and Godzilla vs. Kong, on HBO Max at the same time as in theaters.This isn’t the first time original movies have been released directly on the internet. Netflix and others have been doing it for years. But it’s a first for the major movie studios. In the past, theater chains would have blocked such efforts, but once the pandemic began, their leverage was gone. “The movie business I grew up in is effectively over,” says Alex Kurtzman, a veteran writer and producer whose writing credits include Transformers and Star Trek Into Darkness. “And I’m not sure that’s a bad thing.”This doesn’t mean cinemas are dead. Even with the pandemic dampening U.S. box office returns, Tenet brought in $360 million globally from its theaters-only release in August. But there will be no going back to the way things were. The influx of subscribers has further strengthened the streaming companies’ hand, to the point that every major studio is producing original movies for them and shortening the planned exclusivity windows for theatrical releases. Warner Bros. announced in March that starting in 2022, movies would go to HBO Max 45 days after they leave theaters, down from 90. Universal has cut deals with theaters for a 17-day window, and Paramount Pictures Corp. has said it will go to as few as 30 days. “The experience in the pandemic for us with these films has been really good,” says Andy Forssell, general manager of HBO Max. “Regardless of what happens, we’ll do more and more.”China became the world’s largest movie market for the first time last year, with $3 billion spent on tickets, almost $1 billion more than in the U.S. and Canada. And though it’s easy to dismiss this change as a result of the pandemic—Chinese theaters reopened sooner than those in the West, and most planned major U.S. studio releases were delayed—analysts have been forecasting that it would happen sooner or later. The pandemic only accelerated the timeline by 5 or 10 years.There are many reasons to believe the U.S. won’t ever reclaim its primacy, starting with this one: China has built more than 20,000 screens in the past three years alone, bringing its total to 75,000, almost double the number in the U.S. and Canada. And the U.S. and Canadian figure is declining.Data: PwC report (PwC, Omdia, Bundesverband Audiovisuelle Medien, Ancom)Numbers for 2019 are preliminary; 2020 numbers are a projectionThe globalization of the movie business is a sign of what’s to come for TV as well. International markets contributed 83% of Netflix’s new sign-ups in 2020 and now account for more than 60% of its user base. It will be only another year or two before African, European, and Middle Eastern customers outnumber those in the U.S. and Canada. Disney+, HBO Max, and Amazon.com Inc. are expanding their international streaming operations as well. India already accounts for a third of Disney+ subscribers, thanks in large part to the unique inclusion there of cricket, a national obsession. Disney is hoping to use its formula in India—a mix of sports, original series, and low prices—to expand its reach across South Asia.As American media companies look abroad for growth, they’re also bringing the stories they make there back home. Netflix is investing billions of dollars in programming in more than a dozen languages, and consumption of these shows is soaring everywhere. The French show Lupin and the Spanish Casa de Papel both rank among Netflix’s 10 most popular series ever, globally, and Lupin was the first French show to crack the U.S. daily top 10.“If you nail something and it’s great, it doesn’t matter where it came from,” says Franklin Leonard, a producer and the founder of the Black List, an annual survey that ranks the most-liked unmade screenplays in Hollywood. “There is a willingness to take bigger risks on things that seem culturally specific, because you can gather all the audience that embraces it via streaming.”The most precious commodity in U.S. entertainment right now is the old-fashioned situation comedy. Stuck in isolation, people have sought out comfort food. Viewers devoured Ted Lasso, Apple+’s comedy starring Jason Sudeikis as a U.S. football coach hired to lead a struggling English soccer team. They caught the final season of Schitt’s Creek, a Canadian comedy about a wealthy family brought down to size. “Over the last 12 months, Americans have been looking for a solace away from the realities of the world,” Nielsen Co. wrote in a March report that noted surging interest in comedy.Millions of minutes streamedData: NielsenMany viewers have run out of good new stuff to watch, though. Sitcoms used to be the most popular type of program, led by NBC’s powerhouse “Must See TV” Thursday night lineups. Broadcast networks still release a fair number of sitcoms each year, but streaming services and cable networks have been emphasizing prestige dramas—dark and depressing tales of murder and violence featuring controversial antiheroes. Even so-called comedies such as Barry, Atlanta, and Fleabag weren’t necessarily laugh-out-loud funny. They could be awkward, stressful, and message-driven.The lack of new sitcoms has pushed people deep into streaming-service libraries. Many users of HBO Max have started Friends at 8 p.m. and watched until they fell asleep, leaving episodes to play until morning. Viewership of other old comedies, such as The Bernie Mac Show, Roseanne, and George Lopez, soared. In 2020, Americans spent more than 11 billion minutes watching Family Matters, the 1990s sitcom about a middle-class Black family in Chicago and their ultranerdy neighbor, Steve Urkel.If there’s one thing media companies know how to do, it’s how to run with what works. Apple has ordered two more seasons of Ted Lasso. Reboots of Saved by the Bell, Punky Brewster, Gossip Girl, and more old series are being planned or released. Even with the possible end of the pandemic in sight, Netflix, Amazon, and Hulu LLC are all looking for more big, broad comedies and other escapist programming for the years ahead. Because when people return to the outside world, they’ll be looking for anything but a return to darkness. “People are gravitating toward lighter content,” says Mary Viola, producer of the teen romantic comedy Tall Girl. “The reason we’re doing well at Netflix is we can deliver lighter, poppier fan fare that audiences really seem to respond to.”English-language shows by U.S. production companies, including co-productionsData: Motion Picture AssociationAnyone looking to cut the cord over the past decade has run into the problem of live sports. Netflix offers the same sitcoms, dramas, and reality TV you can find up and down the cable listings, but it doesn’t have the rights to the most popular sports in the U.S. The pro leagues and their media partners have worked hard to keep it that way. Media conglomerates pay huge amounts for the rights to air games, which in turn generate billions of dollars in customer fees for their TV networks; the leagues must respect those rights, and though most major sports operate their own streaming services for hardcore fans, they can be expensive and subject to local blackouts. The leagues have also been reluctant to emphasize streaming for showcase games that promise massive audiences, lest the feeds crash. “The whole business of cable was this crazy machine that got built that extracted a certain number of dollars per household, and it was good for everybody for, like, 20 years,” HBO Max’s Forssell says.Until recently there was little reason to change the model. Even as ratings for most cable programs fell each year, live sports remained a big draw. But viewership has plummeted during the pandemic. The World Series was the least-watched on record. Ratings for the NBA Finals dropped 51% from the year before. The Super Bowl was the least-watched since 2007. At first networks blamed the twin disruptions of Covid-19, which had upset their schedules and forced them to modify their traditional formats, and the presidential election.They responded, though, by doing something they’ve never done before: buying up lots of streaming rights for sports and putting them on their own platforms. In January, Comcast Corp. announced it would shut down NBC Sports Network and shift many of the golf tournaments and Nascar races the channel had hosted to Peacock. Then it bought exclusive rights to the WWE Network and put wrestling on Peacock, too. Disney’s new rights buy for the NHL included 75 hockey games for ESPN+ and Hulu. In the biggest deals of all, Comcast, Disney, Fox Sports, and ViacomCBS Inc. secured agreements to stream NFL games on their services starting next year, in addition to airing them on cable. After years of using live sports to get people to pay for cable bundles, media companies realized they could do the same for streaming services.By fall you’ll be able to watch live football, baseball, tennis, soccer, and hockey on the internet without a cable subscription. A new basketball deal is only a year or two away. With sports in the fold, streaming will truly be the new hub of the entertainment universe. “Now that sports are moving out of the bundle and into streaming, you really have a recipe of the destruction for the legacy multichannel bundle,” says Rich Greenfield, an analyst with LightShed Partners who coined the hashtag #GoodLuckBundle to denote the demise of cable.And now for the downside of all this. As media companies invest in their own streaming services, they’re also reserving their best titles to entice you to subscribe. Want unlimited access to Toy Story for your kids? That’ll be $8 a month for Disney+. How about WWE? Fork over $5 for Peacock. Oh, you like reruns of Friends? Add in $15 for HBO Max. If you stop paying for cable but sign up for all the major streaming services out there, you’ll probably end up spending about the same amount.Year-over-year changeData: Motion Picture AssociationThe pandemic has also increased the cost of making movies and TV shows, because productions must hire health and safety personnel and film for fewer hours per day, thereby prolonging shoots. The average cost of production has grown at least 20%, most producers agree, and it may never go back down. Media companies already tried to recoup those costs by firing thousands of employees last year. Raising prices will be next. Netflix and Disney are already doing so, and it’s only a matter of time before their competitors follow. Some customers will get around this by signing up for services when there’s something they want to watch, then canceling when they’re done, but it will be a hassle.That hassle speaks to the growing belief among some analysts and executives that, as streaming services have proliferated, the ecosystem has grown too complicated to appeal to consumers. There are just too many different bills and support email addresses to deal with. There’s no good universal guide to who’s showing what. And toggling among apps can be confusing and annoying. What the industry really needs is for someone to bring the different services together and package them in one place.

       "  'ILLUSTRATION: NICHOLE SHINN FOR BLOOMBERG BUSINESSWEEKOver the years, Discovery Inc., the owner of Animal Planet and steward of Shark Week, has mesmerized TV audiences with all sorts of Darwinian marvels. Alligator snapping turtles. Giant Tasmanian crayfish. Tree kangaroos. Now, Discovery is trying to pull off its own evolutionary leap, crawling out of the choppy seas of basic cable to invade the fertile land of streaming TV. On May 17, Chief Executive Officer David Zaslav sat alongside John Stankey, the CEO of AT&T Inc., at a hastily convened investor call and provided a blurry snapshot of their newly hatched, multiheaded entertainment hydra.The executives disclosed that AT&T, just three years after completing its costly acquisition of Time Warner and renaming it WarnerMedia, would be spinning off its media assets, which include CNN, TNT, TBS, and the Warner Bros. studio, and merging them with Discovery. Zaslav will lead the new, as yet unnamed, entity. Its portfolio will include a mix of highbrow brands such as HBO—known for creating lavishly expensive scripted programming like Succession—along with a slate of middlebrow, basic cable networks, including HGTV, Food Network, and TLC that are adept at churning out low-cost reality shows like 90 Day Fiancé. “There is no reason why this can’t be the broadest, most successful direct-to-consumer platform in the world,” Zaslav said.AT&T and Discovery have struggled to master the streaming ecosystem. Launched a year ago, AT&T’s HBO Max got off to a slow start, but it’s since gained traction after striking key distribution deals with Roku and Amazon and showing Wonder Woman 1984, Godzilla vs. Kong, and other Warner Bros. films on the same day as their theater premieres. HBO Max and the traditional HBO channel together have about 44 million subscribers in the U.S. and 64 million total worldwide. Discovery’s new streaming service, Discovery+, started in January in the U.S. By late April, the company said it had 15 million streaming subscribers, many of whom get Discovery+.The AT&T deal may have been inevitable given the current state of streaming TV. The market is increasingly global in its outlook and inhospitable to minnows. Netflix Inc. remains the megalodon, with 208 million subscribers worldwide and a pipeline of hits such as Lupin that are popular across continents. But Walt Disney Co., which two years ago bought Rupert Murdoch’s entertainment empire for $71 billion to gain more scale, is catching up fast, with more than 100 million subscribers to its service, Disney+.WarnerMedia and Discovery are just starting to expand streaming services overseas. Both faced obstacles in catching up with the behemoths. WarnerMedia, for now, can’t launch HBO Max in the U.K. and other key European markets because of existing deals HBO made with pay-TV provider Sky. And Discovery lacks the buzzy movie franchises of Warner Bros. studio. Their tie-up is “an explicit acknowledgment that neither company believes it can succeed in the streaming future alone,” says Todd Juenger, a media analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein.Among the new breed of alpha streamers, massiveness is seen as key to survival. After the announcement, Zaslav boasted to reporters that the new entity would have planet Earth’s “deepest programming and film library,” with more than 200,000 hours or programming including “scripted movies and series, animation, sports, news, nonfiction” and children’s programming: “All areas where we have the talent and strength to compete and win.”Zaslav went on to talk up the width of the combined entity’s “marketing funnel,” the reach of its international “content pipelines,” and the consistency of its “franchise tentpoles.” “Big loud films,” he said, would “act as beacons,” keeping customers “engaged and nourished on the platform,” while creating “a steady free-cash-flow machine” for continual reinvestment in programming.But other companies that claimed to have unique synergies—simultaneously owning media properties and the means of distributing them—have seen their hopes for media supremacy dashed. Earlier this month, Verizon Communications Inc. announced it will sell its media division to Apollo Global Management Inc. for $5 billion, abandoning its hold on several once-dominant online brands, including AOL and Yahoo. And while telecom giant AT&T will maintain a stake in the new, unnamed company, it’s essentially ending its broader ambition to use media ownership as a way of reducing churn among its wireless customers, bringing to a close an expensive Hollywood misadventure. “The fact of the matter is, direct-to-consumer is a global opportunity that is rapidly evolving, and the pace of that evolution is accelerating,” AT&T’s Stankey said on May 17.The fast-twitch demands of the streaming-TV business have quickly proven to be out of sync with the circadian rhythms of telecom executives. Traditionally, they’ve been accustomed to luring subscribers with enticing smartphones from the likes of Apple and Samsung, which come yoked to long-term contracts customers may not scrutinize for years, freeing executives to focus on technical upgrades to wireless infrastructure—engineering challenges that glacially play out over decades.The home-entertainment business, by contrast, requires navigating a market that’s subject to much more short-term volatility and requires constant tweaking of programming, cajoling of customers, and fluffing of talent. Richard Plepler, HBO’s former longtime CEO, who spent his early professional years in Washington, mastering the playbook of Capitol Hill, used to tell colleagues they were in a permanent campaign to win over customers. To survive, HBO had to win an election every month.The streaming world is even more demanding. Netflix, Disney+, and HBO Max have to win their subscribers’ attention every hour, every day, every week, or risk losing their fickle consumers to whatever streamer has the hottest new drama, blockbuster action movie, or true-crime docuseries.Zaslav, 61, who has a penchant for sweater vests and is known affectionately in the industry as “Zas,” has spent most of his career in the now-fading cable-TV business. His mentor is John Malone, 80, an early trailblazer of the U.S. industry. As CEO of Discovery since 2007, Zaslav was among the last of the big media chieftains to make his channels available to the growing legions of cord-cutters.But while he’s relatively new to streaming, Zaslav is well-versed in the complexities of running an international media business. Discovery gets about a third of its revenue from outside the U.S. Its shows are seen in more than 220 countries, and it owns a broadcast TV station in Poland. It specializes in the type of unscripted programming that can easily cross borders. Not much of Shark Week gets lost in translation. Discovery has also become a significant player in European sports, with long-term rights to broadcast the Olympics as well as tennis, golf, and cycling across the continent.One question is whether the new company can afford to pay for all the programming it will need to compete in streaming. Before the deal, the two companies spent about $20 billion a year combined on content, according to Zaslav. That’s more than the outlay of Netflix, which plans to spend $17 billion this year. But the company will be burdened with $55 billion in debt, which it will try to pay down using cash from a declining cable business—all while investing in programming for streaming services that will likely lose money for years to come.Zaslav may also possess something WarnerMedia’s old bosses at AT&T didn’t: a keen understanding of how to recruit, nurture, and pamper talent. Known for being well-connected, he throws an annual Labor Day party at his home in the Hamptons where everyone from Jon Bon Jovi to Katie Couric shows up. He takes pride in pointing out that Discovery hasn’t lost any big-name stars to Disney, Netflix, or Amazon Prime. When Fixer Upper stars Chip and Joanna Gaines left HGTV, Zaslav flew multiple times to their home in Waco, Texas, and wooed them back. “The entertainment business is about talent,” Zaslav says. “I love people.”The new company will enjoy one immediate advantage. Its portfolio of brands will include CNN, one of the leaders in cable news. Neither Disney+ nor Netflix can offer subscribers access to a major news outlet as part of their monthly package. Playing up the strategic importance of CNN, Zaslav cited his experience years earlier at NBCUniversal, where he helped start the cable news channels CNBC and MSNBC. “I’ve seen the value of those assets,” Zaslav says. “It’s extremely powerful. And in a world where there is so much content, live news and live sports becomes a real palpable currency.”The deal between Discovery and WarnerMedia is likely to accelerate consolidation in the broader industry, as the owners of other second-tier streaming services look for similar ways to pack on pounds of programming mass. Before the deal’s announcement, Comcast Corp.’s NBCUniversal was seen by many as the most likely destination for AT&T’s media assets. Having missed out on the big meal, Comcast will likely cast a hungry eye elsewhere, perhaps spinning off NBCUniversal and combining it with ViacomCBS Inc. Elsewhere, according to multiple news outlets, Amazon.com Inc. is deep in talks to potentially buy studio MGM, whose stream-friendly library of titles ranges from The Wizard of Oz to the James Bond and Rocky films.Should Discovery or its ilk stumble, there will be a pack of deep-pocketed, ravenous technology companies ready to pick their bones. But they, too, could find a complex business that isn’t easily disrupted in the Netflix era.“Over the past year, we couldn’t have been more clear in our concern that the pivot from linear networks to [direct-to-consumer] models was filled with great risks and under-appreciated pitfalls,” analyst Michael Nathanson wrote in a note to clients the day after the AT&T announcement. “Even the best-in-class companies like Netflix and Disney require constant updating of sexy new content, deep reservoirs of glossy titles, and the commitment to spend dearly until monthly subscriber churn drops to a low enough level that signals it is time to start raising prices. As we saw yesterday, few had the mettle to stare into this abyss and keep going.”'),\n",

But many gamers have long seen EA as a necessary evil, resenting the direction in which it took some games and bristling at its aggressive attempts to extract money by charging extra for digital items in games that cost as much as $70 upfront. This dissatisfaction was no secret in 2018: Gamers spent their days filling up Reddit and other message boards with free advice for EA—but many felt its decision-makers weren’t listening.EA’s leadership knows it has to improve that relationship, and Miele is a key player in its efforts to do so. Her focus group asked for new content for Star Wars Battlefront II and requested new types of games. Miele quickly assigned 70 people to the Battlefront development project, which dramatically improved its net promoter score, a measure of how likely people are to recommend the game. She also prompted EA to create a skateboarding game and committed to reintroducing its college football franchise, the two genres at the top of the influencers’ list.In a sense, the guy at the meeting became a stand-in for all of EA’s long-suffering customers in Miele’s eyes. “I wanted to do right by this player,” she says.As chief studios officer, Miele manages 6,000 staffers and thousands of contractors globally. She oversees EA’s 24 studios, where she makes personnel decisions and sets strategy, and she’s reshaped how the company uses analytics to create and market its games.In the process she may have become the most powerful woman in gaming. In a 2019 International Game Developers Association survey, fewer than 30% of the more than 1,100 respondents were women, and few if any hold a more central role at such an important company. “It’s a tough place for a woman,” says Peter Moore, who was Miele’s boss when he was EA’s chief operating officer. “It wasn’t always smooth sailing, but she battled her way through.”Proving good intentions is more important for EA than ever, as the business model of gaming continues to shift in ways that have the potential to alienate customers. Like its rivals, the company is increasing its focus on free-to-play games, making money through sales of digital products such as outfits and weapons for characters.There are signs it’s succeeding. Apex Legends, EA’s free-to-play hero shooter game, has posted more than $1 billion in sales since it was first published in 2019, and it continues to grow. “The way to succeed with free-to-play games like that is to listen to and engage your customer base and earn their loyalty through incremental purchases,” says Doug Clinton, managing partner of the venture capital firm Loup Ventures, who says Miele deserves much of the credit for Apex Legends. “It feels like a proof point for her that the company is adapting well beyond traditional disk sales.”Miele, 51, was born in San Francisco but grew up on the north shore of Lake Tahoe. She got her start in games—the kind that require a board—during family nights, when she pitted herself against her brother in Monopoly, Clue, Yahtzee, and backgammon. While attending the University of Nevada at Las Vegas, she worked at architectural companies. By the time she dropped out she’d moved on from receptionist positions to more senior roles, while gaining a reputation for organizing lunch-hour card games with her co-workers.Miele landed a job as a project manager at Westwood Studios, a video game developer best known for Command and Conquer, in 1996. She eventually took over all marketing for its parent company, Virgin Interactive.It wasn’t always a hospitable atmosphere: Miele remembers her colleagues expecting her to take notes at meetings, then clean up afterward. “That is just not something I would do today,” she says. “I adapted a lot because I was so passionate about what I was doing. I found my voice along the way.”When EA acquired Westwood in 1998, she stayed on. At the time, the company did revenue forecasting by looking at sales data once a month and putting together spreadsheets by hand. Miele was tasked with developing more advanced analytics. She hired a group of data analysts, nicknamed “the Jedi,” and had them build EA’s first statistical regression models to examine sales trends, seasonality, and preorders. It took almost two years to put the system in place, but it overhauled the company’s business processes, and executives were soon using it to determine how to invest in advertising and promotions. “I loved how data and analytics can inform your judgment and your gut instinct,” Miele says.Miele also decided to make one major break with EA’s existing business practices. In 2011 about 80% of game advertising budgets were spent on TV ads. But she saw how much time gamers spent online and decided to spend the bulk of the ad budget for Battlefield 3 on digital, downplaying other types of ads and cutting the TV ad budget to only 30%.Messing around with the plan for Battlefield 3 was a good way to make people nervous. Miele remembers two executives calling her in for a meeting and demanding to know why they weren’t seeing billboards for the game as they drove in to the office. “It was scary for me, too, and I don’t blame our executives questioning me on that,” she says. But the game ended up being EA’s fastest-selling, moving more than 5 million copies in its first week. From that point, Miele’s marketing strategy became the standard for the company.When EA signed a 10-year deal with Walt Disney Co. in 2013, Miele became Star Wars general manager. In 2014 she took over publishing operations, marketing, and other key areas, first in the North American region, then globally in 2016. At the time, the game industry was moving from physical disks to digital downloads, transforming its relationship with retail partners such as Walmart Inc. and Best Buy Co.Miele was in charge of smoothing things over, explaining that EA would start competing with them for customers even as the retailers accounted for the largest portion of the revenue. “I never said to them, ‘Hey, see you later, we are moving on,’\\u2009” she says. “It was, ‘How can we move forward together?’\\u2009” EA began making physical cards with digital credits that its retail partners could sell at their stores, allowing them to share in the revenue from digital sales.EA’s studios are spread around the globe, and Covid-19 altered Miele’s routine radically. “It was a very difficult year, and I’m really proud about how our company showed up,” she says. “I considered myself a wartime leader last year. You had to get in a bunker with everybody.”Days became an endless progression of Zoom calls. To keep up with gamers, Miele started spending evenings listening to Clubhouse chats while answering work emails. Because she hasn’t been on the road, she’s also had more time to dine at home and play board games or Apex Legends and The Sims with her 16-year-old twins. As the pandemic retreats in the U.S., her schedule might change, but she still envisions providing more flexibility to her employees to work from home and office. “I do think we’re going to have a different work environment as we go forward,” she says.Miele is itching to get back to the studio visits. She’s helping steer EA further toward smartphones. The company plans to release mobile versions of Apex Legends globally this year and spent $2.1 billion in April for Glu Mobile Inc., a mobile game publisher, while also preparing the next releases in its existing franchises. “I think the next Battlefield and the mobile shooter games, along with how successful the M&As come out will be key litmus tests of her management this year,” says Matt Kanterman, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. “Her scope is clearly rising.” —With Dina Bass and Jason Schreier\\n \\nRead next: Curt Schilling’s $150 Million Fail Shows What’s Broken in Video Games'),\n",

       "  '2021-05-04',\n",
       "  'Peacock, Paramount+, Discovery+, and HBO Max are elbowing into the big, messy $11.3 billion market of streaming TV ads.Ben Chappell was binge-watching The X-Files on Hulu recently when he kept seeing the same ads for sports betting apps again and again. He estimates that over three hours he watched the same commercials many times. (Hulu says it caps the frequency a user can see the same commercial at two times per hour, four times per day, or 25 times per week. Customers can exceed those limits when additional ads are sold by third parties.)“It’s complete overkill,” said Chappell, 37, who lives in Lakewood, Colo., where sports betting is legal and ads from the industry are flooding the zone. “Maybe I’d watch them if it wasn’t the same commercial over and over.”Fans of streaming services also say the commercials can be too loud or prone to freezing. Chappell has considered upgrading to a commercial-free version of Hulu, a Walt Disney Co. unit, but he isn’t ready to pay an extra $6 a month. And the problem is hardly confined to Hulu. He’s also noticed repetitive ads on ViacomCBS Inc.’s Pluto TV. For now, he just hits the mute button and vents his frustrations on Twitter, where he recently wrote, “So, are we all just ok with watching the same 7 commercials on streaming services until we goddamned die?”In spite of such complaints, which are commonplace on social media these days, the market for streaming TV ads is growing fast. This year U.S. advertisers will spend $11.36 billion on streaming TV commercials, according to EMarketer, up from $8.11 billion in 2020.2020-2022 are estimates.Data: EMarketerThe boom is being driven, in part, by a slate of new services catering to consumers willing to sit through a few commercials in exchange for paying less to access the programming. Some services with ads, such as Pluto TV and Fox Corp.’s Tubi, are free, while others, like Discovery+, Paramount+, and Peacock, typically cost $5 to $6 a month. Paramount+ and Peacock also charge $10 a month to go commercial free. In June, WarnerMedia will roll out a new ad-supported version of HBO Max. Executives at AT&T Inc., which owns HBO Max, have yet to say how much it will cost. According to CNBC, the service will initially be priced at $9.99 a month.The newcomers are competing for ad dollars with older services including Hulu and YouTube, streaming platforms like Roku and Amazon, and even the makers of smart TVs, such as Samsung, that sell ads inside their apps or inside other streaming services. In the year ended in January 2021, ad-supported services grew their share of U.S. streaming homes to 26%, from 24%, according to Nielsen.Advertisers, however, are struggling to figure out how many people are actually watching their commercials, how often the ads are appearing, and where the spots are being shown. Advertisers can buy directly from a streaming service like Peacock or Discovery+ or buy across hundreds of streaming apps from connected-TV platforms, TV manufacturers, or third-party brokers. Many have their own way of counting viewers. Currently there’s no independent measuring group to play referee across all streaming services the way Nielsen does for traditional TV. Nielsen is developing a metric for the industry to buy and sell advertising more easily across TV and streaming services, but it won’t be ready until 2024. “It’s fragmented, and advertisers have to stitch it all together,” says Dave Morgan, chief executive officer of Simulmedia, which helps marketers buy more-precise TV ads. “It’s cumbersome.”Brad Adgate, an industry consultant, says the current state of the business is reminiscent of the early days of cable TV, when advertisers bought commercials on new channels like MTV or USA with no way of knowing whether they were getting their money’s worth. After Nielsen began measuring cable audiences in the 1980s, advertisers got more comfortable with the medium, and the whole thing took off. “It was the Wild West back then, as it is now with streaming,” Adgate says.Media giants such as Comcast Corp.’s NBCUniversal, ViacomCBS, and Discovery Inc. say that in some crucial ways their streaming services offer an upgraded experience for advertisers and viewers compared with the advertising options of yesteryear. They’ve introduced new formats that aim to be less irritating to customers than traditional breaks full of 30-second spots, such as commercials that appear on the screen only when the viewer pauses a show.The media companies also like to point out that ad-supported streaming platforms tend to show significantly fewer commercials than their progenitors in traditional TV. Discovery+ and Peacock promise to show no more than five minutes of commercials per hour, which is less than half the usual load on cable or broadcast TV.Streaming services also promise advertisers they can better target particular slices of viewers. Jon Steinlauf, Discovery’s chief U.S. advertising sales officer, says that on Discovery+ “if you only want to reach women with two children under 12 with $100,000 in income, we can sell you that.” Yoplait can buy a Discovery+ ad right after a scene on a cooking show during which someone said the word yogurt—something that would be hard to do on TV.Because the inventory per hour is limited and streaming ads typically can’t be skipped, media companies argue that such spots are more valuable. The price of ads on Discovery+ is about three times higher than on the company’s cable networks, which include HGTV and TLC.By this fall, Peacock’s viewership among a key demographic, 18- to 49-year-old viewers, should be roughly the same as the audience on the NBC broadcast network in prime time, so the ad rates are expected to be about equal, says Laura Molen, president of advertising and partnerships at NBCUniversal. “Media is a vehicle to get advertisers to consumers,” she says. “Think of Peacock as a luxury vehicle.”Some ad buyers say the streaming services should be priced more like economy sedans. On traditional TV, advertisers typically know the exact time, network, and program during which every commercial appeared. But some streaming platforms will only disclose in which group of content, like lifestyle or sports programs, the ad ran, or only provide the total number of times an ad was seen. That can make it hard to determine whether a commercial appeared next to controversial content or how many times it aired to a specific household.“They’ll say, ‘We’re not going to tell you where it ran. Just trust us that it ran against this target audience,’” says David Spencer, assistant manager of audience buying strategy for General Motors Co. “That’s not something that we’re OK with.”Advertisers also say streaming services can’t target viewers with the same precision as can be done on Google or Facebook. Jack Kelly, national integrated media manager at Subaru of America, which advertises on Peacock, Discovery+, Hulu, and Paramount+, says he’d like to show viewers different commercials depending on whether they own a Subaru or are just thinking about buying one. But he can’t do that yet on a streaming service. “That’s the holy grail of advertising,” he says.Advertisers are also wary of irritating potential customers by inadvertently bombarding them with the same spot ad nauseam. An automated ad server sometimes shows viewers the same spots repeatedly when marketers ask to reach a certain number of streaming viewers quickly. The repetition may be exacerbated when a streaming service sells inventory to only a small number of sponsors—NBC had only 10 advertisers at Peacock’s launch last July, for instance—and that smaller pool of advertisers may make it seem that subscribers are seeing the same ads over and over.Pluto TV tries to ensure viewers don’t see the same commercial more than once every 30 minutes, though there are some cases when an advertiser runs multiple ad campaigns at the same time, which can lead to repetition. NBC has tried putting caps on how often a commercial appears on Peacock. It also recently started selling Peacock commercial time to a wider array of advertisers. Another possible reason for the sense of repetition, Molen says, is that some ads are just catchy. “Jake from State Farm is a memorable guy,” she says.\\n \\nRead next: How TikTok Chooses Which Songs Go Viral'),\n",

       "  '2021-04-28',\n",
       "  'By his count, Jonathan Damato has brought at least a dozen people back from the dead. Over 20 years as a New York City paramedic, those are the moments he remembers most. The ones that called him to the job early on and kept him coming back, a year into a pandemic, in one of the world’s worst hot spots. “Clearly, we’re masked up, you know, you’re protected, but you’re exposing yourself to this every single day,” he says.Damato remembers seeing his first Covid-19 patient, an elderly man whose vitals seemed to defy medical logic. Based on his blood oxygen levels, the man should have been unconscious; instead he was just a little short of breath, chatting and sitting upright. In so many of those early cases, Damato says, it was impossible to know how to respond. He and his colleagues barely understood the disease, hospitals were already overflowing with patients, and the medical crews couldn’t get their hands on enough protective gear. “A lot of the crews got nervous and panicked,” he says.America’s recent vaccine news has been good. More than half of U.S. adults have now received at least one dose of a Covid vaccine. In most states, new cases are down or at least not surging. Medical personnel know how to better treat Covid patients, which has kept hospitalizations and deaths to a fraction of their winter highs. It’s starting to feel as if life might approach something like normal as spring rounds the corner into summer. There’s just one big, honking, horrifying question: Will enough Americans roll up their sleeves to end the pandemic, or will too many skip out on getting the shots?Throughout the past year, Damato’s biggest concern has been bringing the virus home to his family. He lives and works on Staten Island, New York City’s biggest Republican enclave. He’s married with five kids, and his 4-year-old son, Nico, has a serious heart condition that’s required more than a half-dozen surgeries, making him especially vulnerable to the virus. When Damato comes home, his uniform goes straight from a plastic bag to the wash. In November, as promising trial data suggested it was more and more likely a vaccine might be ready before the end of the year, he wrote a sarcastic Facebook post remarking on other people’s overblown fears about vaccine side effects. He and his wife, a teacher, could see their borough getting hammered by the virus. He was working more overnight shifts than ever, and they were both extremely exhausted from juggling the kids because they were in and out of school. Damato couldn’t wait to get his shot. Then his aunt texted him a response to his Facebook post.The aunt, a nurse, said she wanted him to consider another point of view. She sent him literature, but Damato says the accompanying video was what really got him. In the video, a man who identifies himself as a coronavirus researcher makes a bunch of claims about problems with the coming vaccines. He says—falsely—that the mRNA vaccines have been rushed to market without proper trials and that drugmakers had covered up safety concerns about how the vaccines might kill people or sterilize them. The video was full of such misinformation and outright lies, and a quick Googling showed Damato that the “researcher” had been associated with conspiracy theories before. But that didn’t matter. The seeds of doubt had been planted. “I felt even if half of his concerns were correct, it was enough to worry about,” Damato says. “There are too many questions.” Earlier this year, when his station was offered the vaccine, he opted out.So did many of his colleagues. The Fire Department of the City of New York says only 47% of its EMTs and paramedics have been vaccinated, and similar reports of health workers opting out have poured in from across the country. About 3 in 10 front-line health-care workers are either planning to skip the vaccine or are on the fence, according to a March poll by the Washington Post and Kaiser Family Foundation. More recent Kaiser polling puts the number for all Americans at 37%. There are especially large pockets of skepticism among Republicans, people of color, and rural residents. And Damato’s story is a common one: Waves of public-health messaging are often less powerful than a single text from a trusted friend or relative.People like Damato aren’t anti-vaxxers. (The paramedic gets his flu shot every year.) They’re vaccine skeptics, people who don’t quite know what to think, so they figure why not wait and see how the shots work out for others, or they bet on the protection they’ll get from everyone around them being vaccinated. “One of the problems with the framing of the pro and the anti is that it kind of pushes out this middle group that are undecided but are still open,” says Heidi Larson, the director of the Vaccine Confidence Project at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. “If they’re not getting a reasonable answer or even feeling like they’re demonized for just asking questions, it hardens them, and they’re more vulnerable to some of the more extreme views.”The bigger problem for everyone, even in a now vaccine-rich country like the U.S., is that there are too many of these fence-sitters to bet on widespread immunity protecting the populace anytime soon. The fewer people who get vaccinated, the longer the pandemic will drag on and the more lives will be lost. America might have the technology and personnel to stamp out the disease, but not necessarily enough trust left in public-health efforts to get it done.Witness the spike in overall skepticism after six cases of blood clots among roughly 7 million recipients of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine led the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to recommend a pause in its rollout. For everyone besides the rare clot sufferers, the data is stunningly good news, an extremely small number of adverse events compared with a virus that has killed more than a half-million Americans. But blood clots fit perfectly into the narrative that Covid shots aren’t as safe as the government wants the public to believe. Distrust makes misinformation seem more believable, and the pandemic has primed a whole lot of people to be more skeptical of the public-health establishment. Doubt, like Covid-19, is highly contagious.For Damato, all it took was a text and a video. “I was so blind,” he says. “I didn’t even look to see the other side, the people who are not getting the vaccination. Like, it wasn’t even a thought in my head, why would I not get the vaccination?” Now, whenever someone asks his opinion on the vaccine, he sends them the video his aunt sent him.The Covid vaccines approved in the U.S. are highly effective. A study of health-care workers and first responders released at the end of March found that both the Pfizer and Moderna shots prevent 90% of infections after a second dose. These mRNA vaccines also seem to prevent most viral transmission. Based on that data, the feds have said that vaccinated people can feel comfortable hanging out in small groups.But no vaccine is 100% effective. The mysteries of human biology mean that some vaccinated people will still get sick when exposed to the virus. So far there have been about 7,000 such “breakthrough cases” out of the 94 million or so Americans who’ve been fully vaccinated. Overall demand for vaccines is still high, but a recent Bloomberg analysis found that in some pockets demand is waning long before a larger percentage of the population has been inoculated.Vaccine skepticism is as old as vaccination. Larson, in London, discovered yellowed 19th century pamphlets opposing mandatory smallpox shots while she was researching her 2020 book, Stuck: How Vaccine Rumors Start—and Why They Don’t Go Away. The sentiments are depressingly familiar, inveighing against impositions on the natural order and freedom of choice. Over the past several decades, however, skepticism in the U.S. has been turbocharged by state governments’ strong hand in mandatory childhood vaccinations and the online disinformation campaigns of fanatical anti-vaxxers. The steady erosion of trust in government and a shared set of facts have lent an added potency to rumors, allegations, and conspiracy theorists’ YouTube videos.In 2000 the World Health Organization declared that the U.S. had rid itself of the measles. Fifteen years later, after a major outbreak at Disneyland in California, it became clear that too many Americans had grown skeptical of mandatory vaccinations and were betting on community immunity to protect their kids. Measles is extremely contagious, so more than 95% of kids in a community need to be vaccinated against the disease to stop it from spreading. An MIT study that surveyed vaccination rates in 43 states found that most of the kids who caught measles at Disney were living in counties with vaccination rates as low as 50%, according to Maimuna Majumder, one of the study’s authors. “It was really eye-opening,” says Majumder, now a health-informatics researcher at Boston Children’s Hospital.During the pandemic, prominent anti-vaxxers like Robert F. Kennedy Jr., whose nonprofit Children’s Health Defense has been estimated to be responsible for more than half the vaccine misinformation on Facebook, have also benefited greatly from the Trump administration’s disastrous initial response. “Anybody who asks me about vaccines has already lost some faith in the traditional structure of ‘You should trust your doctor, you should trust CDC, you should trust FDA,’\\u2009” Kennedy says. The Center for Countering Digital Hate, or CCDH, says that the roughly 150 leading anti-vaxxer accounts gained more than 10 million social media followers from December 2019 to December 2020, especially on Instagram and YouTube. (Instagram banned Kennedy in February, but he remains on Facebook, and his organization is on Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube.)Where Kennedy and other anti-vaxxers have been loud, public-health officials have often been quiet. After Damato’s aunt planted the seeds of doubt, the paramedic went hunting for more information from his employer and says a staff doctor echoed his concerns. (An FDNY spokesperson says the department has provided extensive educational resources on vaccines to its employees). Like many Americans, Damato has been suspicious of surprises that have changed official guidance, whether shifting views on masks or the record-fast vaccine development that Donald Trump promised. “He swore it was going to be ready by a certain time, and everyone said it’ll never be ready by then. Boom. It was ready by the time,” Damato says. “These are medical professionals that you’re supposed to trust, but they can’t even get on the same page, so why should I believe them?”Even getting the information he was after might not have been enough to convince Damato. He was already disinclined to trust his bosses given their failures to provide proper protective equipment and training earlier in the pandemic—plus some failures before that. Damato was a first responder at the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001, and like many of his colleagues, he has health issues including sleep apnea and chronic sinus problems he says stem from his department’s lack of protective gear back then.Common public-health practice relies on facts as the best counterpoint to lies, but that won’t be enough to talk skeptics into getting jabbed, says Matt Motta, a political science professor at Oklahoma State University at Stillwater. He says public-health officials need to work to win over the public by addressing their specific concerns and by approaching the subject empathetically rather than rolling their eyes. “There’s no one-size-fits-all approach,” he says, “because there’s no one-size-fits-all reason why people accept vaccine-hesitant views.”Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has been on a whirlwind public-speaking tour, trying to win over hesitant Black Americans by addressing Black churches and chatting with celebrities including Steph Curry and LL Cool J. “It is not surprising, but extraordinary and interesting, how when you get a trusted member of society, of the community, to come out and start talking about why it’s important to get vaccinated, how people who would otherwise be very hesitant go ahead and say, ‘OK, I’m good with vaccine,’\\u2009” Fauci says.The number of people who are firmly against vaccines is very small. The number of people in the middle is far larger. Anti-vaxxers and public-health officials such as Fauci are locked in a battle of persuasion with that middle group as the prize. But if the problem is trust, the burden of earning it is on health officials, who haven’t focused much on education about what efficacy rates actually mean, for example, or the nature of the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System.Vaers is a government-run, publicly available database of self-reported potential side effects or other perceived problems. If patterns emerge, the FDA and the CDC investigate, but mostly the reports simply sit online, unverified and un-fact-checked. That is to say, they’re ready-made propaganda for anti-vaxxer fanatics and skeptical followers who might not know that no one is fact-checking them. The internet is full of videos of anti-vaxxers simply reading off lists of injuries reported in Vaers. Groups including Kennedy’s frequently send out fearmongering emails highlighting the rising number of Vaers-reported deaths.This phenomenon is part of a larger problem of public-health officials and advocates ignoring spurious arguments and real failings in favor of simply soldiering on with their own messages, says Chris Martin, a public-health professor at West Virginia University. The idea is to avoid raising unfounded concerns that might plant the seeds of doubt, Martin says, but that doesn’t account for the bad actors seeding conspiracy theories that use health officials’ silence as Exhibit A. A better course of action, he says, would be to teach physicians, nurses, and public-health advocates how to talk to people about their vaccine skepticism. “We need to train the trainers,” he says.The U.S. could do worse than to follow the lead of Martin’s home state. West Virginia proved, for a time, to be a remarkable vaccine success story.On the surface, that result sounds extremely unlikely. West Virginia is Republican and rural, with mountainous terrain that makes vaccine delivery a serious logistical challenge. Many of its residents are also poor, with health conditions that make them especially at risk for severe cases of Covid. And yet, by mid-February, West Virginia had used up more than 100% of the roughly 380,000 vaccine doses it had been allotted, the first state to do so. It was the first to finish vaccinating its nursing homes, by pairing a network of pharmacies with about 200 long-term-care facilities in lieu of the federal plan.Ayne Amjad, the state’s head doctor, attributed these successes to West Virginia’s reliance on trusted local pharmacies to administer the vaccines rather than big chains. This was word-of-mouth working in vaccination’s favor, she says. People hesitant to get the shots felt comfortable asking questions at the mom and pops: “There was that trust built in with them.” Republican Governor Jim Justice also tapped Clay Marsh, the respected vice president of the West Virginia University health sciences center, as its coronavirus czar. Marsh’s local ties have been credited with helping speed the early rollout.Now, though, with about 38% of West Virginia’s 1.8 million residents having received at least one dose, the vaccination drive has slowed. In mid-April, with the CDC now ranking West Virginia 47th in percentage of vaccinated residents, Justice said the state’s administration rate had sunk to an “incredibly low” 85%. “We’ve got a problem to really get after it, to educate more and more folks,” Justice said during an April 21 press briefing. “If we don’t, we’re not going to get rid of these masks.” The next step, says Martin, will be to get vaccines into the family doctors’ offices, churches, and schools where unvaccinated people already are.Polling has shown that as more people get vaccinated, those who still aren’t say they are more open to it. Watching your friends and family get inoculated is a powerful motivator. But as vaccination has opened up to more groups of people, early hopes that skepticism would fade away altogether are dissipating. More pockets of the country like West Virginia are beginning to report they have more shots than demand. Several states are now administering fewer than 75% of the doses they receive, according to the CDC. Federal survey data peg the South and the Upper Midwest as the most hesitant regions. One of the White House’s plans is a celebrity ad campaign in which the likes of Mark Cuban, Eva Longoria, and Kelly Ripa urge young people to get their shots.Back in New York, Damato keeps spreading the gospel of skepticism among his friends and FDNY colleagues. He says he did encourage his parents to get Covid vaccines, because their age was too significant a risk, but he’s less worried about Nico now that his son’s heart is in much better condition. Although Damato says he hasn’t firmly decided against getting the vaccine himself, he’s unsure what could drive him to say yes at this point. “I’m not going to get it until maybe down the road,” he says. “If I ever do.” '),\n",

       "  'Video game studios are risky ventures, as the new book Press Reset explores—and the outing between an opinionated baseball star and Rhode Island’s smartest politicians remains the stuff of legends.38\\u2005Studios was the type of company a teenager might dream up when fantasizing about what it’d be like to make video games for a living. The company was building a wildly ambitious game to compete with the megahit World of Warcraft and appeared to be flush with cash. Employees received top-notch health benefits, gym memberships, and personalized high-end gaming laptops worth thousands of dollars. There were free meals, lavish travel expenses, and Timbuk2 bags customized with an illustration of the world map for their in-progress video game, code-named Copernicus. The man behind 38 Studios was Curt Schilling, the retired pitcher best known for his time with the Boston Red Sox. Schilling was a legend, famous for his performance on the field and his combativeness off it. In the 2004 playoffs, he’d pitched two games with an ankle that had been injured so badly it soaked his sock in blood. The performance helped the team win its first World Series in almost a century, and Schilling’s bloody socks earned a place in baseball lore.During his playing career, Schilling had been a star, and he thought the people building Copernicus should be stars, too, says Thom Ang, an artist who’d done work for Disney on The Lion King and Toy Story, along with stints at big-name games companies such as Sony, Electronic Arts, and THQ. “He said, ‘That’s how I want my team to feel. I’m going to attract the best, and I’m going to treat them as if they’re the best.’ And he did.”Ang was skeptical when he first got a call from a 38 Studios recruiter in 2008. But the role-playing game looked fantastic, and the company offered him a hefty relocation package, so he moved from Southern California to become its art director. Sure, the studio hadn’t made a lot of progress in the two years it had been operating, and its timeline to finish the game by the fall of 2011 did seem a little unrealistic, but Ang didn’t think that was a problem. He’d seen how slowly things could move at the beginning of a project. And Ang knew he didn’t have to worry about 38 Studios’ finances or wonder where the money was coming from. After all, Schilling had earned in excess of $114 million over his two decades in baseball.Video games are big business, generating more than $150 billion in annual sales. The biggest hits account for a disproportionate amount of that revenue, which is why Schilling had said publicly he thought he could get “Bill Gates rich” by building his own blockbuster. But volatility is also the status quo in gaming. Too many companies struggle to provide stable, healthy environments for their workers. All it takes is one flop or sloppy business decision to lead a billion-dollar game publisher to enact a mass layoff or shut down a studio, no matter how much money it made in a given year.In 2017 the nonprofit International Game Developers Association asked approximately 1,000 game workers how many employers they’d had in the previous five years. Among those who worked full time, the average was 2.2 employers; for freelancers it was 3.6. James Batchelor, a reporter at GamesIndustry.biz, counted up all the jobs lost to studio closures in the 12 months ended September 2018—a time when the industry was thriving—and found the number was over 1,000.Job listings for big game publishers like Take-Two Interactive Software Inc. and EA advertise careers, not temporary gigs. But there’s actually a high level of instability. Developers who accept the pleasure of creating art for a living must also acknowledge that it might all fall apart without much notice. “With all the layoffs I’ve dealt with, I get a PTSD-type thing whenever there is an email for an all-hands meeting in an office,” says Sean McLaughlin, an artist who has worked in gaming since 2006. “I no longer put more things on my desk than I can carry out in one bag.”Ang and others at 38 Studios thought this company would be different, and they were right in one sense. Video game studios collapse all the time, but rarely with the kind of star power and political controversy that surrounded its demise.\\n Schilling first grew obsessed with video games—especially massive multiplayer online role-playing games, where players interact freely in sprawling digital worlds—during long summers on the road as a pro athlete. As his playing career wound down, he decided he wanted to make a video game of his own. He started a company, named it after his jersey number, and seeded it with $5 million. He declared he was going to create a “utopian” office—a place where making video games felt not like a dreary nine-to-five job but like you’d just made it to the big leagues.This account is based on interviews with former executives and employees at 38 Studios. Schilling initially agreed to an interview but then stopped responding to requests. He had never run a business before, and that became clear with everything he said or did. Early on, he had suggested that everyone work the odd schedules common for professional baseball players, coming into the office for 14 straight days and then taking five days off—an idea that his executives quickly shot down. By the beginning of 2010, he had invested $30 million of his own money into 38 Studios, and although he’d taken other small investments from friends, he knew that 38 needed far more money to bring Copernicus to reality.Schilling was, in addition to being a serious gamer, a World War II buff, maintaining a collection of historic memorabilia including, most controversially, Nazi uniforms. That March, he met Donald Carcieri, the Republican governor of Rhode Island, at a fundraiser the former pitcher was holding for a documentary on the war he hoped to support. The two started talking about 38 Studios, and the talks eventually developed into a plan for the Rhode Island Economic Development Corp. to create what they called the Job Creation Guaranty Program. Rhode Island would offer a $75 million loan guarantee to 38 Studios in exchange for a commitment from Schilling to relocate from Massachusetts and create 450 new jobs over three years.For 38 Studios’ employees, the move to Rhode Island represented a potential hardship, so Schilling and his management team offered to pay for home closing costs. More remarkably, they said that anyone who owned a house in Massachusetts and couldn’t sell it would have the option to sell it to 38 Studios, which would take care of mortgage payments until a buyer came along. In the wake of the 2008 housing crash, Ang had a mortgage that was worth more than the value of his house. The deal with 38 Studios seemed like the perfect opportunity to get out of a bad spot.The company expanded rapidly after the move, in no small part because the loan agreement had stipulated that 38 Studios create the first 125 new jobs in Rhode Island within 12 months of closing. The new employees settled in for the long haul. “The people were top-notch, top talent in the industry,” says Pete Paquette, an animator who joined the company in 2011. “And I was prepared to just live there the rest of my life, to work there the rest of my career.”The game looked gorgeous, too. It was full of sleek medieval castles and vivid environments—humongous waterfalls, ancient statues, craggy mountains, menacing underground cities lit with sickly shades of neon green. But it was still years away from release, and 38 Studios had to start paying back the Rhode Island loan right away. Throughout 2011, reports later suggested, 38 Studios had a burn rate of more than $4 million a month. This would eat through most of the loan in a year, because 38 Studios only received about $49 million, with the banks keeping the rest. After the studio’s collapse, Schilling said the shortfall was partially to blame.When Andy Johnson started working at 38 Studios in January 2012, he went around its headquarters at One Empire Plaza in Providence introducing himself to executives, designers, and developers. As part of his job, which was to facilitate the translation of the games into other languages, he put together an estimated release schedule. Even his most conservative estimate showed that there would be no way for Copernicus to come out that year.The following week, Johnson brought the schedule to one of 38’s vice presidents, who shut the door and asked him who else had seen it. “Everything started cascading into lunacy,” he says. Word spread among the other vice presidents and executives, who would barge into Johnson’s office and interrogate him about the disappointing document. “I was like, ‘Oh crap.’ I had just done my due diligence of trying to figure out sizing, scope, estimate time for all this stuff,” he says. “I felt like I’d uncovered some big secret.”Soon afterward the studio imposed a hiring freeze. This left Johnson unable to do his job, while colleagues had taken to locking themselves in their offices, working on spreadsheets or polishing their résumés. In March, 38 Studios stopped paying many of its external vendors. On May 1, it failed to make one of its bank loan repayments, putting the loan into default.The studio was making progress on Copernicus, and some of the ideas it was exploring seemed groundbreaking by the standards of the day. Players could change the outcome of the world based on how well they performed. If one group of gamers defeated the evil dragon, their world would enter a celebratory state. Another group might fare worse, failing to beat the dragon and watching it destroy their cities with molten lava.Most of the staff had no idea of the trouble they were in until later that spring. On May 14, Lincoln Chafee, who had succeeded Carcieri as governor, told reporters that his goal was “keeping 38 Studios solvent.” Those four words spooked potential investors that Schilling had been wooing, including gaming giants Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Nexon Co. “The conversations ended immediately,” Schilling later said on a Boston radio show. “I knew then that we were in a world of hurt.”It became clear to most employees the following day, which was supposed to be payday. Heather Conover, a designer, remembers walking to the office when a colleague asked if she had been paid. When they arrived at the office, Conover logged in to her checking account. There was no deposit. “We all sort of had this sinking feeling as it started spreading,” she says.The next few days were chaos—a blur of angry all-hands meetings and frazzled employees. Management asked them to keep coming in, while reporters with cameras and microphones camped outside the office. Some developers didn’t bother showing up. Others tried to bring home the office equipment. “People were picking up desktops and monitors, saying, ‘Screw this, I’m taking this, that’s my payment,’\\u2009” Johnson says.Chafee began publicly revealing what 38 Studios saw as proprietary information, like Copernicus’s projected release date (by now June 2013). A longtime critic of the loan guarantee deal, the governor blamed the company’s freewheeling spending. In a scathing newspaper editorial a few years later, Schilling called Chafee a “liar and a phony.”Through the end of May, many workers kept showing up even though the paychecks never came. A few people put together a two-minute YouTube trailer showing off Copernicus, partly as a last-ditch effort to try to persuade some other video game publisher to hire them but also to ensure that their work would still be seen by the world even if no one ever played the game.Some of 38 Studios’ employees still believed Schilling would find a way to keep the company afloat, just like he saved the 2004 Red Sox. “I kept thinking, ‘They’re going to pull a rabbit out of their hat,’\\u2009” says Ang. “\\u2009‘They’re going to work something out.’\\u2009”Instead, on May 24, an email went out to everyone who worked for 38 Studios, telling them it was their last day. The note came not from Schilling, but from Bill Thomas, the studio’s chief operating officer—and also the uncle of Schilling’s wife. The note, which was bizarrely cold for a company whose executives often talked about the organization as a “family,” cited an “economic downturn” within the company. “A company wide lay-off is absolutely necessary,” wrote Thomas. “These layoffs are non-voluntary and non-disciplinary. This is your official notice of lay off, effective today.” There was no more health care, no severance—employees wouldn’t even get the money they were owed from their final paychecks.The collapse of 38 Studios devastated Schilling. Bankruptcy filings later showed that when the studio collapsed it was $150 million in debt, with millions owed to investors, vendors, and insurers. Schilling said he’d put $50 million of his own money into the company and was now “tapped out.” In the years following the studio’s closure, he became a right-wing provocateur, advocating for Donald Trump and sharing conservative memes on Facebook and Twitter, where he spent a great deal of time attacking liberal politicians, progressive causes such as Black Lives Matter, and just about every news organization that wasn’t named Fox. In 2015, Schilling was suspended from his job as an ESPN analyst for posting images comparing extremist Muslims to Nazis. A year later, ESPN fired him for sharing transphobic memes on social media.As he attacked Democrats and made racist remarks in public, Schilling was giving depositions and watching his company’s assets sold off in a bankruptcy auction. But as with all studio closures—at least a dozen have shut down since 2018—perhaps the strongest burden fell on the employees.Hundreds of former 38 Studios employees were left stranded in Rhode Island, where there were no other video game companies or jobs. Those who wanted to stay in the video game industry had to again uproot their lives and move to new cities. In the weeks following the shutdown, the video game industry came together to try to help out the displaced employees. Recruiters promoted social media hashtags like #38jobs and flew out to Providence for a job fair. Rhode Island sent representatives to One Empire Plaza so that people could file for unemployment at the office, while some staffers brought in canned food to help struggling co-workers.For Ang, the kicker came in the form of a letter from MoveTrek Mobility, the company that 38 Studios had hired to sell his old lake house in Massachusetts. Turns out it hadn’t sold. And somewhere in the fine print of his contract, Ang had agreed that if 38 Studios ever faced financial trouble and stopped paying the mortgage, the obligation would fall back on him. Panicked, Ang called up MoveTrek and asked what was going on. “They said, ‘It means you have to pay the bank on the loan,’\\u2009” he says.\\n \\nAdapted from the book Press Reset: Ruin and Recovery in the Video Game Industry by Jason Schreier.

       "  'The fast rise and even faster fall of a trader who bet big with borrowed money.Before he lost it all—all $20 billion—Bill Hwang was the greatest trader you’d never heard of.Starting in 2013, he parlayed more than $200 million left over from his shuttered hedge fund into a mind-boggling fortune by betting on stocks. Had he folded his hand in early March and cashed in, Hwang, 57, would have stood out among the world’s billionaires. There are richer men and women, of course, but their money is mostly tied up in businesses, real estate, complex investments, sports teams, and artwork. Hwang’s $20 billion net worth was almost as liquid as a government stimulus check. And then, in two short days, it was gone.The sudden implosion of Hwang’s Archegos Capital Management in late March is one of the most spectacular failures in modern financial history: No individual has lost so much money so quickly. At its peak, Hwang’s wealth briefly eclipsed $30 billion. It’s also a peculiar one. Unlike the Wall Street stars and Nobel laureates who ran Long-Term Capital Management, which famously blew up in 1998, Hwang was largely unknown outside a small circle: fellow churchgoers and former hedge fund colleagues, as well as a handful of bankers.He became the biggest of whales—financial slang for someone with a dominant presence in the market—without ever breaking the surface. By design or by accident, Archegos never showed up in the regulatory filings that disclose major shareholders of public stocks. Hwang used swaps, a type of derivative that gives an investor exposure to the gains or losses in an underlying asset without owning it directly. This concealed both his identity and the size of his positions. Even the firms that financed his investments couldn’t see the big picture.That’s why on Friday, March 26, when investors around the world learned that a company called Archegos had defaulted on loans used to build a staggering $100 billion portfolio, the first question was, “Who on earth is Bill Hwang?” Because he was using borrowed money and levering up his bets fivefold, Hwang’s collapse left a trail of destruction. Banks dumped his holdings, savaging stock prices. Credit Suisse Group AG, one of Hwang’s lenders, lost $4.7 billion; several top executives, including the head of investment banking, have been forced out. Nomura Holdings Inc. faces a loss of about $2 billion.Hwang is anything but the larger-than-life figure one might expect at the center of a financial fiasco. There’s no penthouse overlooking Manhattan’s Central Park, no hillside chalet at the Yellowstone Club, no private jets. “I grew up in a pastor’s family. We were poor,” he said in a video recorded at New Jersey’s Metro Community Church in 2019. “I confess to you, I could not live very poorly. But I live a few notches below where I could live.”Hwang owns a suburban New Jersey home and drives a Hyundai SUV. His is the paradoxical story of a man devoted to his church and driven to give generously, with a consuming taste for casinolike risk in his professional life. For now, Hwang isn’t saying why he played such a dangerous game, and neither are his bankers. But pieces of the puzzle are falling into place.Modest on the outside, Hwang had all the swagger he needed inside the Wall Street prime-brokerage departments that finance big investors. He was a “Tiger cub,” an alumnus of Tiger Management, the hedge fund powerhouse that Julian Robertson founded. In the 2000s, Hwang ran his own fund, Tiger Asia Management, which peaked at about $10 billion in assets.It didn’t matter that he’d been accused of insider trading by U.S. securities regulators or that he pleaded guilty to wire fraud on behalf of Tiger Asia in 2012. Archegos, the family office he founded to manage his personal wealth, was a lucrative client for the banks, and they were eager to lend Hwang enormous sums.On March 25, when Hwang’s financiers were finally able to compare notes, it became clear that his trading strategy was strikingly simple. Archegos appears to have plowed most of the money it borrowed into a handful of stocks—ViacomCBS, GSX Techedu, and Shopify among them. This was no arbitrage on collateralized bundles of obscure financial contracts. Hwang invested the Tiger way, using deep fundamental analysis to find promising stocks, and he built a highly concentrated portfolio. The denizens of Reddit’s WallStreetBets day trading on Robinhood can do almost the same thing, riding such popular themes as cord cutting, virtual education, and online shopping. Only no brokerage will extend them anywhere near the amount of leverage billionaires get.To anyone who asked, Hwang liked to say he divided his time evenly among three passions: his family, his business, and his charity, the Grace & Mercy Foundation. “I try to invest according to the word of God and the power of the Holy Spirit,” Hwang said in a 2019 video for his foundation. “In a way it’s a fearless way to invest. I am not afraid of death or money.”Sung Kook Hwang immigrated to the U.S. from South Korea in 1982 and took the English name Bill. Raised by his widowed mother, he attended the University of California at Los Angeles and eventually earned an MBA at Carnegie Mellon University. At a videotaped business school reunion that was posted online in 2008, Hwang recounted his one objective upon graduation: moving to New York. In 1996, after stints as a salesman at two securities firms, he landed an analyst’s job at Tiger Management.Working for Robertson, a titan of the industry, was like playing for the New York Yankees. Many of Hwang’s colleagues at the time went on to start several of the world’s most successful hedge funds, including Andreas Halvorsen’s Viking Global Investors, Philippe Laffont’s Coatue Management, and Chase Coleman’s Tiger Global Management.As Hwang recalled at the reunion, Robertson taught him a key lesson: to live with losses. At one point, Tiger had burned through $2 billion in a wrong-way bet against the Japanese yen, and “everyone was panicking.” Robertson entered the room and, according to Hwang, said, “Guys, calm down. It’s only work. We do our best.”When Tiger closed in 2001, Robertson urged Hwang to start a fund and offered to seed it with capital. In the early days, both Tiger Asia and Coleman’s Tiger Global were on the same floor at Robertson’s Park Avenue offices. Hwang and Coleman would sometimes have lunch together to share views on the market. One former Tiger Asia employee remembers Hwang returning one day. He and Coleman had decided against paring back some investments amid market volatility. “I think Chase and I are very similar. We need to go on the offense,” Hwang said, according to the former employee.None of Hwang’s former colleagues or employees agreed to be named speaking about him. Some remain friends and don’t want to appear disloyal. Others are constrained by pledges of confidentiality. The people familiar with Archegos, both its accounts and positions, spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to comment.Hwang initially sought to differentiate himself by investing only in Korean, Japanese, and Chinese companies that generated all of their revenue domestically. Former clients and colleagues say Hwang concentrated the Tiger Asia portfolio in a small number of stocks and levered it. Some of his 25 or so positions were longs (bets on rising prices)and some were shorts (bets on declining prices). And he was secretive, often concealing particularly large holdings from his own analysts, the former employee says. He’d repeat these patterns years later at Archegos.In 2008, Tiger Asia was shorting Volkswagen AG when takeover speculation sent the shares soaring. The stock quadrupled in two days, and Hwang had to close his position at a loss. He ended the year down 23%, and many investors pulled out, furious that an Asia-focused fund was gambling in European markets.At least once, Hwang stepped over the line between aggressive and illegal. In 2012, after years of investigations, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accused Tiger Asia of insider trading and manipulation in two Chinese bank stocks. The agency said Hwang “crossed the wall,” receiving confidential information about pending share offerings from the underwriting banks and then using it to reap illicit profits.Hwang settled that case without admitting or denying wrongdoing, and Tiger Asia pleaded guilty to a U.S. Department of Justice charge of wire fraud. His mother, who’d become a missionary in Tijuana, Mexico, called to ask about the penalties. Hwang recounted the moment in a 2016 talk in South Korea. When he informed her that the fines and disgorgements totaled more than $60 million, she replied, “Oh, dear. You did well, Sung Kook. Our America is going through a difficult time. Consider the amount you are paying as a tax.” He had to close the fund.In 2013, Hwang started Archegos as a family office. There were no outside investors this time, only his money. Some friends, thinking back, figured he wanted to prove himself after the SEC settlement. Others saw no interest in redemption. Risk-taking is to Hwang as basketball is to LeBron James, something in his nature.Although little known on Wall Street, Hwang has been a pillar of his church community. His Grace & Mercy Foundation gave millions of dollars a year to mostly Christian causes. The Fuller Foundation and Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, Calif., and Washington’s Museum of the Bible are two of its biggest beneficiaries. Others, in New York, include the Bowery Mission and the King’s College, a Christian liberal arts school.Hwang hosted three Scripture readings a week at his foundation offices in Midtown Manhattan—a 6:30 p.m. dinner on Monday, a 12:30 p.m. lunch on Wednesday, and a 7 a.m. breakfast on Friday. He paid for another at Metro Community Church, too. Between listening to scripture and reading himself, Hwang said he spent at least 90 hours over the course of every year digesting the entire Bible.Hwang is closely involved with a group called Liberty in North Korea, or Link, that has helped about 1,300 North Koreans escaping the regime. “He doesn’t use God as a cover,” says Jensen Ko, a colleague at Archegos. “He lives that out.”In February 2016, Hwang’s name appeared on an invitation emailed to members of the Financial Services Ministry, a group affiliated with New York’s Redeemer Presbyterian Church that connects Christians in finance. It advertised a weekend retreat at the Princeton Theological Seminary “to explore the Gospel’s power to transform who we are and what we have been called to do in this industry.” The highlight was a dinner on a Saturday with three of the ministry’s advisers: Cathie Wood, whose ARK Investments was then a startup money manager; Paul Gojkovich, a former director at Merrill Lynch; and Hwang.For a while, Wood and Hwang shared a similar trajectory. As Archegos piled up winning trades outside the public eye, she became an investing sensation. Wood’s flagship exchange-traded fund, a technology-heavy portfolio open to any retail investor, wowed the market with a 148% return in 2020. Hwang is also one of Wood’s investors, and, according to one of his former employees, Archegos and ARK collaborated on industry research. ARK declined to comment.The seminary retreat offered a glimpse of how Hwang reconciled faith with finance. One person who attended recalls talking to him about the Archegos portfolio, which then included Amazon.com, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Netflix. As Hwang explained it, cutting-edge companies were doing divine work by advancing society. He told congregants in his 2019 appearance at Metro Community that God loved Alphabet Inc.’s Google because it provided “the best information to everybody.” Archegos had owned the stock for five years. “God also cares about fair price, because the scripture said God hates wrong scales,” Hwang says in the video, invoking the multiple references to just weights and balances in the Old Testament. “My company does a little bit, our part, bringing a fair price to Google stock. Is it important to God? Absolutely.”\\n U.S. rules prevent individual investors from buying securities with more than 50% of the money borrowed on margin. No such limits apply to hedge funds and family offices. People familiar with Archegos say the firm steadily ramped up its leverage. Initially that meant about “2x,” or $1 million borrowed for every $1 million of capital. By late March the leverage was 5x or more.Hwang also kept his banks in the dark by trading via swap agreements. In a typical swap, a bank gives its client exposure to an underlying asset, such as a stock. While the client gains—or loses—from any changes in price, the bank shows up in filings as the registered holder of the shares.That’s how Hwang was able to amass huge positions so quietly. And because lenders had details only of their own dealings with him, they, too, couldn’t know he was piling on leverage in the same stocks via swaps with other banks. ViacomCBS Inc. is one example. By late March, Archegos had exposure to tens of millions of shares of the media conglomerate through Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Credit Suisse, and Wells Fargo & Co. The largest holder of record, indexing giant Vanguard Group Inc., had 59 million shares.Share priceData: Compiled by BloombergThere’s no evidence Archegos did anything improper. The atmosphere maintained in its offices was notably sober. One former employee says there was no cursing tolerated, a policy borrowed from Robertson’s Tiger that stands in stark contrast to the profanity common on most trading floors. The same source also recalls Hwang toting a backpack like a college student and praising Uniqlo, the fast-fashion brand, because it’s cheap and comfortable—a utilitarian ideal.The clash of humility and audacity played out on the 38th floor of 888 Seventh Ave., high above Central Park. On one side was Grace & Mercy, on the other Archegos. People familiar with Hwang’s investments the first few years he ran Archegos say they included Amazon; Expedia Group, the travel-booking engine; and LinkedIn, the job-search site Microsoft would acquire in 2016. A winning wager on Netflix Inc. netted Archegos close to $1 billion, one former colleague estimates. Hwang appeared to be channeling the same thesis Wood was applying at ARK and which millions of retail investors were beginning to embrace: technological disruption.He was on a hot streak. By 2017, Archegos had about $4 billion in capital, according to a former banker who helped oversee its account at his firm. Hwang was sharing few financial details with his lenders, but no one raised any red flags. His leverage at the time was about the same as a typical hedge fund running a similar strategy, or two to two-and-a-half times, this person says.\\n One problem with stockpicking at Hwang’s scale is hedging. Many sophisticated stockpickers try to reduce their risk by balancing long positions with shorts on similar names. That way they’ll make up some losses with profits if the market tanks.In principle, shorting is simple: You borrow shares and sell them, making money if the stock declines. In practice, it’s often hard to find enough shares or borrow them cheaply. Another way to hedge is what’s known as a portfolio short, a broad bet against the stock market, often made through an options or futures contract on the S&P 500. It’s relatively easy to execute, but the hedge doesn’t work if the market doesn’t drop. The ex-banker says he recalls Archegos having a portfolio short.At some point in the past few years, Hwang’s investments shifted from mainly tech companies to a more eclectic mix. Media conglomerates ViacomCBS and Discovery Inc. became huge holdings. So did at least four Chinese stocks: GSX Techedu, Baidu, Iqiyi, and Vipshop.Although it’s impossible to know exactly when Archegos did those swap trades, there are clues in the regulatory filings by his banks. Starting in the second quarter of 2020, all Hwang’s banks became big holders of stocks he bet on. Morgan Stanley went from 5.22 million shares of Vipshop Holdings Ltd. as of June 30, to 44.6 million by Dec. 31.Leverage was playing a growing role, and Hwang was looking for more. Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley had been doing business with Archegos for years, unperturbed by Hwang’s brush with regulators. Goldman, however, had blacklisted him. Compliance officials who frowned on his checkered past blocked repeated efforts internally to open an account for Archegos, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter.At the close of every trading day, Archegos would settle its swap accounts. If the total value of all positions in the account rose, the bank in question would pay Archegos cash. If the value fell, Archegos would have to put up more collateral or, in industry parlance, post margin.The fourth quarter of 2020 was a fruitful one for Hwang. While the S&P 500 rose almost 12%, seven of the 10 stocks Archegos was known to hold gained more than 30%, with Baidu, Vipshop, and Farfetch jumping at least 70%.All that activity made Archegos one of Wall Street’s most coveted clients. People familiar with the situation say it was paying prime brokers tens of millions of dollars a year in fees, possibly more than $100 million in total. As his swap accounts churned out cash, Hwang kept accumulating extra capital to invest—and to lever up. Goldman finally relented and signed on Archegos as a client in late 2020. Weeks later it all would end in a flash.Share priceData: Compiled by BloombergThe first in a cascade of events during the week of March 22 came shortly after the 4 p.m. close of trading that Monday in New York. ViacomCBS, struggling to keep up with Apple TV, Disney+, Home Box Office, and Netflix, announced a $3 billion sale of stock and convertible debt. The company’s shares, propelled by Hwang’s buying, had tripled in four months. Raising money to invest in streaming made sense. Or so it seemed in the ViacomCBS C-suite.Instead, the stock tanked 9% on Tuesday and 23% on Wednesday. Hwang’s bets suddenly went haywire, jeopardizing his swap agreements. A few bankers pleaded with him to sell shares; he would take losses and survive, they reasoned, avoiding a default. Hwang refused, according to people with knowledge of those discussions, the long-ago lesson from Robertson evidently forgotten.That Thursday his prime brokers held a series of emergency meetings. Hwang, say people with swaps experience, likely had borrowed roughly $85 million for every $20 million, investing $100 and setting aside $5 to post margin as needed. But the massive portfolio had cratered so quickly that its losses blew through that small buffer as well as his capital.The dilemma for Hwang’s lenders was obvious. If the stocks in his swap accounts rebounded, everyone would be fine. But if even one bank flinched and started selling, they’d all be exposed to plummeting prices. Credit Suisse wanted to wait.Late that afternoon, without a word to its fellow lenders, Morgan Stanley made a preemptive move. The firm quietly unloaded $5 billion of its Archegos holdings at a discount, mainly to a group of hedge funds. On Friday morning, well before the 9:30 a.m. New York open, Goldman started liquidating $6.6 billion in blocks of Baidu, Tencent Music Entertainment Group, and Vipshop. It soon followed with $3.9 billion of ViacomCBS, Discovery, Farfetch, Iqiyi, and GSX Techedu.When the smoke finally cleared, Goldman, Deutsche Bank AG, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo had escaped the Archegos fire sale unscathed. There’s no question they moved faster to sell. It’s also possible they had extended less leverage or demanded more margin. As of now, Credit Suisse and Nomura appear to have sustained the greatest damage. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc., another prime broker, has disclosed $300 million in likely losses.It’s all eerily reminiscent of the subprime-mortgage crisis 14 years ago. Then, as now, the trouble was a series of increasingly irresponsible loans. As long as housing prices kept rising, lenders ignored the growing risks. Only when homeowners stopped paying did reality bite: The banks all had financed so much borrowing that the fallout couldn’t be contained.“While people will be talking about how this guy had one of the biggest losses of wealth ever, he will not be defined by that,” says Doug Birdsall, who attended services at Redeemer Presbyterian Church with Hwang and whose nonprofit benefited from his philanthropy. “People will remember the kind of life that he lived, the character that he showed, the courage, humility and continued generosity.” The best thing anyone can say about the Archegos collapse is that it didn’t spark a market meltdown. The worst thing is that it was an entirely preventable disaster made possible by Hwang’s lenders. Had they limited his leverage or insisted on more visibility into the business he did across Wall Street, Archegos would have been playing with fire instead of dynamite. It might not have defaulted. Regulators are to blame, too. As Congress was told at hearings following the GameStop Corp. debacle in January, there’s not enough transparency in the stock market. European rules require the party bearing the economic risk of an investment to disclose its interest. In the U.S., whales such as Hwang can stay invisible. —With Hema Parmar\\n \\nRead next: Here’s Why So Many People Intend to Die With Money in the Bank '),\n",

       "  'Elon Musk’s upstart still rules, but traditional automakers are catching up fast.He doesn’t date a synth-pop star, publicly puff on blunts, or profess to want to die on Mars, but Herbert Diess is starting to look and sound an awful lot like Elon Musk.The chief executive officer of Volkswagen AG kicked off a March 15 news conference modeled after Tesla Inc.’s “Battery Day”—Diess called his “Power Day”—by declaring that there’s only one way to quickly reduce emissions from transportation: Go electric. Skeptics could be forgiven for raising their eyebrows at that message, coming as it was from the same carmaker that spent years gaslighting the world about “clean diesel.” But VW is finally seeing the payoff from its five-year effort to create a standardized platform to underpin dozens of electric models. “Many in the industry questioned our approach,” Diess said during the two-hour infomercial he led from VW’s headquarters in the German city of Wolfsburg. “Today they are following suit, while we are reaping the fruit.”VW last year became the No.\\u20091 electric-vehicle maker in Europe, where sales of battery-powered cars surged thanks to stricter carbon dioxide limits. After the introduction of the ID.3 hatchback in 2020, the ID.4 crossover—the first global model based on VW’s electric platform—is starting to reach showrooms from Shanghai to Chicago. This year, VW plans to deliver 1 million plug-in hybrid and fully electric vehicles, and Diess aims to surpass Tesla in EV sales no later than 2025. Some analysts predict it will happen much sooner.New battery-powered passenger car registrations in Western Europe, 12-month rolling average**EU member states prior to 2004 expansion, plus Norway, Switzerland, and Iceland.Data: Schmidt Automotive ResearchIn addition to staging splashy events, mixing it up on Twitter, and spewing shameless bombast, Diess has something else in common with Musk lately: a stock price headed into the stratosphere. Sure, Tesla’s sky-high valuation means Musk could afford to buy VW tomorrow if he so desired (he doesn’t), but VW’s common shares have jumped more than 80% this year. Musk has long said that he welcomes EV competition and that Tesla’s mission was to accelerate the advent of sustainable energy. He got what he wanted.EVs are shifting from what seemed like a one-man show to an extravaganza with an increasingly crowded stage. Although VW has as good a chance as anyone to share top billing with Tesla, what’s less clear is the rest of the cast. General Motors Co. CEO Mary Barra sent her stock price soaring in January when she said she wanted to phase out gas and diesel cars by 2035. Many Chinese manufacturers are rolling out budget EVs, and Hyundai Motor Co. is planning almost two dozen models. Renault SA had a surprise hit in Europe last year with its Zoe, a battery-powered hatchback. In the U.S., Ford Motor’s Mustang Mach-E is hitting showrooms, and Amazon.com-backed Rivian Automotive and Lucid Motors—a Tesla clone that’s on track to raise $4.4 billion in funding—are seeking to replicate Musk’s success.Tesla has done to the auto industry what Netflix Inc. did to cable TV, speeding the shift away from internal combustion in much the same way easy access to Breaking Bad and hundreds of other shows spurred consumers to take the scissors to their Comcast contracts. But just as Netflix now sees a growing challenge from parts of the old guard—think Walt Disney Co. and HBO—incumbent automakers are starting to emulate the upstart. (Of course, cable TV companies also face a threat from the likes of Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., and Google, which in this analogy are\\u2009…\\u2009Amazon, Apple, and Google.)Even though Disney+ was years behind Netflix, Disney’s service has been a runaway success with new fare such as The Mandalorian offered alongside its deep catalog of classics like Pinocchio, Toy Story, and Mulan. Similarly, Diess has won over investors by making the case that VW can exploit something Tesla doesn’t have much of yet: scale. With a dozen brands that fill every nook and cranny of the auto market—and sales last year of 9.3 million vehicles, compared with a half-million for Tesla—VW is uniquely positioned to pool resources and bear the cost of developing new technologies. By next year, VW will have 27 models based on its standardized platform. “Our transformation will be fast,” Diess said at his event, “bigger than anything the industry has seen in the past century.”Like Musk, Diess is going big on batteries and charging stations. By 2025, VW and its partners will have more than 35,000 public chargers around the world. And one element of its legal agreement with the U.S. and California over cheating on emissions tests was a pledge to spend $2 billion promoting plug-ins and building charging infrastructure. VW in 2017 set up an affiliate called Electrify America that now boasts the largest fast-charging network in the U.S. Diess is also planning a half-dozen battery factories in Europe, which BloombergNEF estimates will require an investment of almost $18 billion. The energy researcher says improvements in cell design, battery chemistry, and manufacturing put VW on track to cut the cost of batteries in half by as early as 2025. That could make its EVs cheaper than similarly equipped combustion cars.Some rivals insist VW’s headlong charge into electric cars is imprudent because they remain a sliver of global sales—roughly 3% of vehicles delivered worldwide last year. Toyota Motor Corp., which narrowly surpassed VW as the world’s largest automaker in 2020, has long argued hybrids are a more sensible intermediate solution. And BMW AG has embraced flexibility, building many of its models in various versions: gasoline-powered, hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and electric. “We think a one-propulsion strategy could be very dangerous,” CEO Oliver Zipse told Bloomberg Television on March 17. “The likelihood that 150, 160 markets in a very short period of time—and one decade is a very short period of time—will converge fully into one drivetrain is highly unlikely.”Diess has no plans to hit the brakes. Even as the first models from the current platform start to roll out, VW is furiously developing a separate set of standard components for electric vehicles from Audi, Porsche, and its other upscale brands. That premium platform promises speedier charging times, greater range, and faster acceleration than the first-generation models. By the middle of the decade, VW says it will have a single scalable system to underpin all its battery-powered cars—no matter the brand or segment—as it aims to sell 26 million of them in the next 10 years. “They’ve got confidence that they can catch up with Tesla,” says Michael Dean, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, who expects VW to take the global EV crown by 2023. “Their foray into electrification is serious.” —With Christoph Rauwald\\n \\nRead next: What if the Perfect Climate Fix Can’t Arrive in Time?'),\n",

       "  'Sydnee McRae, 1.1 million TikTok followers: “I was telling one of the big managers that I was doing $500 as a minimum. She was like, no, you should be at like $5,000 per video.”Anyone can get famous on TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram, but it’s a lot easier to make a living if you’re White.Since high school, Sydnee McRae had liked the idea of getting paid to make videos online. After graduating, she started making beauty tutorials on YouTube, but she managed to attract only 500 followers—not nearly enough to get brands to pay her for promoting their products or even to get the occasional freebie. Then, a year ago, McRae, now 22, had a breakthrough on TikTok, the short video platform.It was just as Covid-19 lockdowns were beginning. McRae created and performed a dance to Captain Hook, Megan Thee Stallion’s sex-positive club banger. She encouraged others to try out the dance themselves with a hashtag, #captainhookchallenge, and a tutorial video that explained her dance step-by-step. The videos were popular, attracting more than 400,000 likes. Within weeks, many of the platform’s top stars—influencers with millions of followers—performed their versions of her choreography, helping the song soar in popularity, too. In April, Megan Thee Stallion herself joined in, posting a 15-second video from her kitchen.McRae was in heaven. “I realized, wow, I created something that people love,” she says. She started gaining followers by the thousands. Soon musicians and record labels were getting in touch, asking her to promote their songs and offering to pay her around $500 per dance. McRae found a talent manager and quit her job as a sales manager at Massage Envy in Miami.In May, McRae received $700 from Universal Music Group to promote a new song, Out of Love by the rapper Lil Tecca, with a new dance challenge. It was a hit, too, and McRae was excited a few weeks later when she saw Addison Rae Easterling repeating her dance. Easterling isn’t quite as famous as Megan Thee Stallion, though in the world of TikTok influencers she’s the queen: She has 70 million followers (to McRae’s 1.1 million) and has made, according to Forbes, millions of dollars off her dances and lip-sync videos, thanks to deals with brands that include American Eagle, Fashion Nova, and Reebok.McRae is Black and Easterling is White, which seemed germane when she learned from her manager that Easterling had also been hired to perform McRae’s dance and was paid substantially more. Instead of the hundreds of dollars Universal gave McRae to create the dance, Easterling had been paid thousands by Lil Tecca for just her performance. The news burned. “I’m creating the art, I’m giving you the art, without me there would be no art,” McRae says. “But I don’t get the same respect, the same amount that these White creators get.”The phenomenon of White artists appropriating the work of Black creators—and getting paid more to do it—is as old as the entertainment industry itself. But McRae’s experience cuts against the meritocratic promises of the likes of TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube, which allow creators to achieve celebrity without going through agents or casting directors. Now that there’s real money to be made on these platforms—brand endorsements on social media account for $10 billion a year globally, according to SignalFire, a venture capital firm that tracks industry data—a new class of gatekeepers has emerged. They’re corporate marketers and digital ad agency executives trying to capitalize on the new Hollywood, and most of them are White. The result, according to interviews with dozens of influencers, is that White social media stars consistently make far more than their Black counterparts, even in cases where Black influencers have more followers or are doing more of the creative work. White choreographers with followings similar to McRae’s routinely make $5,000 to create and perform a dance. McRae generally gets one-tenth that, and she has noticed the same pay disparity across the industry. Although Easterling at least credited McRae, other white influencers often fail to do so.In other cases, Black influencers aren’t paid at all. Stacy Thiru, who gives beauty tips to her 1.5 million TikTok followers, says that before she knew what her true market value was she’d regularly accept products—wigs, for instance—in lieu of cash when she created promotional tutorials for beauty companies. “They got free promo,” she says. “All I got was hair.” Another well-known social media personality, Jordan Craig—also known as the meme-maker Ka5sh—says he became aware there was a racial gap in pay when he attended an event with a few White memers, all of whom had similar followings. They showed up in new luxury cars; Craig, who is Black, couldn’t afford a car at the time and came in an Uber. “It’s crazy to be famous on the internet and then have it not mean anything,” he says. “Literally, I was not sure where I was going to sleep last March.”For years, marketers viewed racial messages, and especially the Black Lives Matter movement, as divisive. They inserted provisions into contracts that specifically prohibited influencers from talking about police or using the #BLM hashtag. “The country is morally divided, and actively taking a stance felt outside of their area of expertise and risky to their bottom line,” says Karyn Spencer, chief marketing officer for Whalar Ltd., an influencer management and social media advertising agency.But last summer, just as McRae was starting to get discouraged about her new industry, that calculus changed. Americans of all races took to the streets to protest the killing of George Floyd by police. Corporate brand managers, motivated by genuine enthusiasm—and the awareness that being tied to a popular civil rights movement would be great marketing—joined a chorus of calls for racial equality. They ghost-wrote open letters about race for their executives to sign and scrambled to feature people of color in advertisements.Alongside rising death counts from Covid-19, lockdowns, and reports of police violence, marketers began to worry that the usual aspirational advertising was missing the mark. In the BLM movement they saw an opportunity to talk about something that felt meaningful, especially to younger consumers who seemed to be interested in little else. In the past, Black creators had to aggressively pitch themselves, says Jack Young, an influencer manager who specializes in working with people of color. Now brands were calling him nonstop.One of Young’s clients, Kenny Knox, a 22-year-old sketch comic—he helped pioneer a style of online comedy in which a single actor plays all the characters in a skit—struck sponsorship deals with Trident gum, Axe deodorant, and Gillette razors, among other brands. “I don’t know if it’s them wanting to work with me because it’s me, or if they feel bad and they see me and want their brand to look better,” says Knox. “But I’m thankful.” By the end of 2020 he was making enough money to rent an apartment without roommates for the first time.Knox had gotten his start making six-second videos on Vine, the old video app. He was one of the service’s most popular users, but he didn’t even realize that companies paid influencers for posts until he began trading notes with his White peers, many of whom make as much as $100,000 per video these days. “I should be a millionaire right now,” he says. “My friends, my family, they all look at me like I’m about to be Will Smith.”In 2017, Knox had secured a modest deal to record a video for Target Corp. On his way to the studio, a Target rep called to cancel, because the rep had noticed that he’d used the N-word in a recent comedy video. Black comedians and musicians, of course, use the word all the time, but Knox nonetheless offered to delete the offending post. The rep said it didn’t matter; Target was no longer interested. “It’s a cop-out, because no brand has hesitated to hire a rapper,” says Young, his manager. Knox now warns other Black creators to keep their content clean.This makes him different from White influencers like Jake and Logan Paul, who also became famous on Vine and who make millions of dollars a year, despite antics that have included throwing (and filming) raucous, unmasked parties during Covid-19 lockdowns. Jake repeatedly used the N-word in one of his videos, and Logan once filmed a dead body. The men have since been forgiven by the brands that temporarily shunned them. On a podcast last summer, Logan acknowledged that “half of the reason I’m able to get away with my hooligan shit I do in my vlogs is because I’m a White kid.”Another famous influencer, Felix Kjellberg, a White man from Sweden better known as PewDiePie, has at times courted controversy by making anti-Semitic jokes, by using the N-word, and, most recently, for behavior that violated YouTube’s rules against bullying. In 2017, when Kjellberg was cut off from big contracts with YouTube and Disney Maker Studios, he still made $12 million in advertising, according to Forbes. Last year he signed an exclusive streaming deal with YouTube. “If I was doing some of the things they are doing,” says Black influencer Landon Moss, referring to White influencers such as Kjellberg and the Pauls, “I wouldn’t be doing the brand deals I’m doing.”In Hollywood, racial biases have tended to flow from the top. Executives hire White directors and producers, who in turn work with White casting agents, who cast White actors. When Black talent is considered, it’s often for roles or projects that specifically require it. Social media companies have often promoted diversity initiatives, but in practice they’re not much different.In the summer of 2018, Facebook Inc. was preparing the launch of a mobile video service for Instagram, IGTV, that was intended to compete with YouTube. Instagram employees were tasked with briefing and training the photo-sharing app’s biggest stars to use the new platform ahead of the official launch so that it would be full of videos by the time regular people logged on. Mark Luckie, who then worked with Instagram’s influencer partnerships team, was charged with curating a list of creators of color. Luckie, who is Black, produced a proposal for superiors that included some of Instagram’s most popular Black users. “Most of them are Instagram heavyweights,” he wrote, adding that they would bring “a welcome level of talent and diversity to the product launch.”His proposal, which was obtained by Bloomberg Businessweek, was rejected on the grounds that Facebook couldn’t trust the creators Luckie identified to keep IGTV secret. “Due to leak risk we can’t be comfortable briefing any creators we don’t already have a relationship with unfortunately,” a manager replied. The manager encouraged Luckie to contact the names on his list after the launch.Luckie thought his bosses were missing out on a huge business opportunity. Around the same time, an internal Facebook research report showed that Black and Hispanic users outperformed others on almost all the metrics the company cared most about, including engagement, overall time spent on the platform, and time spent on video. The report said Facebook’s metrics matched the overall media market: Black and Hispanic users spent an average of 55 hours a month on mobile devices, 27% more than their peers of other races, and consumed 137% more streaming video. Black users in particular commented and posted more than those from other demographics—yet Facebook had made scant effort to cultivate Black creators.Luckie left the company later that year, describing a “disenfranchisement of Black people on the platform” in an open letter to Facebook staff. “You can see this reflected in everything from the guest lists of Facebook’s external programs, the industry events the company has historically sponsored, the creators and influencers who appear in Explore tabs on Instagram, the power users who are verified on the platforms, and more,” he wrote. Facebook, notorious for making decisions based on data, was instead pursuing relationships with creators based on employees’ personal tastes. A company spokesman, Charlton Gholson, disputes Luckie’s interpretation of events and says the choice to brief creators was not based on racial considerations. He adds that the company has since “augmented our partnerships approach to be more equitable.”Today, Luckie recalls that members of the partnerships team would take turns telling the group what they were watching or listening to in weekly meetings. “I’d sort of latched on to a pattern that everyone was recommending shows with primarily White characters, music from White artists, thinking, ‘this is kind of terrible,’\\u2009” he says. If employees had taken the time to browse the top-performing beauty artists or music artists or comedians on their own platforms, they’d have had no trouble finding talent of color.Last June, as brands started to become comfortable talking about race, so did Facebook. Instagram product chief Adam Mosseri said in a blog post that the company would “take a harder look” at whether its algorithms held any bias against Black people. “We’re also hearing concern about whether we suppress Black voices and whether our products and policies treat everyone equally,” he wrote.Instagram started a campaign to increase the visibility of Black talent on its app with the hashtag #shareblackstories, and Facebook started a $25 million fund to support Black creators. Google followed suit with an announcement in June that YouTube would set aside $100 million to back original programming over multiple years that would “present fresh narratives that emphasize the intellectual power, authenticity, dignity and joy of Black voices.” In January, TikTok Inc. announced a three-month incubator program for Black creators that would include “motivational town halls” and “educational events with TikTok executives.”Black creators are hopeful but skeptical that the newfound enthusiasm will change the industry. Layla Qasim, a situational humorist and makeup artist who goes by @neko_channn on TikTok, where she has 2.4 million followers, calls these new initiatives “extremely performative.” She’s been to Black creator meetups and Black History Month events hosted by platforms, but she wonders why her peers aren’t elevated by the companies simply for their talent, outside of a diversity initiative. “They try to shove a Black creator up front and say, ‘Look! A Black creator!’\\u200a\\u2009” she says. Meanwhile, Black creators like Qasim say they have a harder time getting verified on the apps or getting recommended to users through TikTok’s “For You” page. They’re also more likely, they say, to get banned or punished by algorithms designed by overwhelmingly White and Asian coders.In February, five well-known influencers, including Qasim and Thiru, the beauty specialist, started living together in a six-bedroom house in the Hollywood Hills, which they named The Crib Around the Corner. “Content houses,” often sponsored by brands and managed by talent agencies, have exploded in popularity as creators look to pool resources and pitch themselves as a group.The Crib is overseen by Whalar, the influencer management agency, which envisioned it as a way for influencers of color to band together, exercising more leverage over brands during negotiations. Whalar sources deals for the Crib’s residents, all of whom are Black and who have agreed to be paid the same for any projects they take on. AT&T TV is already signed up as the house’s sponsor. Backing the Crib is “an opportunity to address the compensation gap for Black creators, giving them a platform to share content that inspires and entertains while receiving equal pay,” says Vince Torres, an AT&T Inc. senior vice president. The company declines to say how much it is spending on the initiative.For the influencers, living and working together is also a way to trade notes. Black creators have “a lack of knowledge, because we don’t really have those opportunities, we don’t really see how we’re getting cheated,” says Dare Ajibare, a house member with a million TikTok followers. All five of the residents have done deals with brands, which, they later learned, had paid White influencers more for similar work. Several say they were able to negotiate for higher pay, but only by agreeing to do more posts in exchange for the extra money. The three women in the house—Qasim, Thiru, and Challan Trishann—say that they’ve shown up for shoots where none of the hair or makeup artists were prepared for their complexion.So far, audiences have responded favorably. The Crib’s TikTok account has attracted 175,000 followers, and its first video drew almost 1 million views. Ajibare says that to know he has brand executives and managers on his side is “a newfound feeling.”Unfortunately, it’s not clear that this will mean more money for other Black influencers. Most brands, even as they speak the language of empowerment, haven’t changed their ways, creators say. And there’s a possibility that brands will go back to their old ways if BLM fades.McRae, the TikTok choreographer, still charges around $500 a post. She’s planning on moving from Miami to Nashville, where she thinks the lower rents will allow her to save money and begin preparing financially for the moment when her fame ends. “I’m constantly second-guessing myself,” she says. “Is it going to randomly stop? Am I going to still be able to do what I’m doing? Even if I am, it’s still not going to be equal. How long will this last before I have to go back and work a 9-to-5?” '),\n",

       "  'Thousands of illegal websites are streaming the latest hit shows and movies to viewers in Southeast Asia.Julius is an avid Netflix viewer. Whether it’s old movies, anime, or hit releases such as The Queen’s Gambit, the 28-year-old banker from Manila, who gives only his first name, is glued to his laptop. He just doesn’t pay for any of the content. The moment a show starts trending on Netflix’s Top 10, he catches it on an unlicensed streaming website or downloads an illegal copy from a file-sharing app. “It’s always available somewhere,” he says. “If I can save a few hundred pesos a month, I’ll take it.”Julius and millions like him across Southeast Asia are becoming a headache for Netflix, Disney+, and Chinese streaming giants Tencent and IQiyi, which are waging an intense contest for subscribers in the region. Thousands of illegal websites streaming the latest hit shows and movies—content cribbed from legitimate services—cater to viewers from Vietnam to the Philippines, while other operators sell cheap hardware that allows access to pirated content. Shutting them down is a cat-and-mouse game made harder by governments that don’t consider the theft a high priority, according to the industry.Data: Asia Video Industry Association/YouGov surveys conducted in August and September of 2019“Before, piracy was seen as a nuisance, a cost of doing business,” says Neil Gane, head of the Coalition Against Piracy in Hong Kong, which includes foreign and local industry members. “Now pirated content is in direct competition with legal services. Piracy has evolved—it’s international, sophisticated, and it’s high on the list of challenges for streaming services.”Piracy will cost TV and movie providers almost $52 billion in revenue worldwide in 2022, according to Statisa.com. It remains a daunting problem in big markets such as China and Russia, the sites of prolonged battles to curb digital theft. But it’s the rising demand in Southeast Asia, home to more than twice the population of the U.S., that’s raising warning flags. In the past two years, Indonesia, Vietnam, and other countries have been added to the U.S. trade representative’s “notorious markets” list, an annual compilation of the worst intellectual-property abusers and counterfeiters.Even before the pandemic, piracy was taking over. In five out of six Southeast Asian nations, more than half the respondents to a survey sponsored by the Asia Video Industry Association (AVIA) said they accessed illegal streaming sites in 2019. It was highest in the Philippines, where 66% admitted doing so. In Indonesia, 62% of those who accessed the sites said they’d canceled subscriptions to paid services. Visits to pirated sites increased by a third globally when lockdowns began last March, according to Muso TNT Ltd., which tracks piracy; in India, access to pirated movies jumped 63%, according to one of its surveys.By the end of this year only 6.5% of households in Southeast Asia will have the streaming services of Netflix Inc. or Walt Disney Co., according to consultant Media Partners Asia. So countering piracy before it becomes further entrenched could be key to their long-term growth in the region. “It’s still early days,” says Vivek Couto, who runs Media Partners Asia. “The industry needs government policy that criminalizes the act and cracks down on operators.”For now, viewers in Vietnam can watch hits such as Netflix’s Bling Empire and Disney’s WandaVision almost as soon as episodes come out. One popular pirate site even uses Netflix’s distinctive red typeface for its own logo. Consumers can also use illegal streaming apps and devices, available at local electronics marts, to view premium content.At the Metro Manila Film Festival in December, officials at Globe Studios, a local production company, were hoping to get a few days of sales for their entry, Fan Girl, before the pirates caught up. The studio, which makes movies bought by Netflix, charged viewers 250 pesos ($5.15) per download during the virtual festival. But by the second day pirated sites were screening the romantic comedy, with some charging just 10 pesos a view. “We were glued to our computers, watching 10 links pop up every hour—giving the movie away. Some had 45,000 views,” says Quark Henares, head of the studio, a unit of Globe Telecom Inc. “We were supposed to lean back and enjoy the box-office success. Instead, we were tracking down websites and couldn’t shut them down.” Henares says Globe lost millions of pesos of festival revenue. Theft is making it impossible to produce content profitably in the Philippines, he says.Pirate sites in Asia often have links to illicit online gambling, says Gane, whose antipiracy group is part of AVIA. Offering free entertainment allows pirates to draw customers to gambling sites and gain revenue from other questionable advertising there. Some websites offering pirated movies have ties to organized crime groups who use the proceeds to fund serious crimes and engage in money laundering, according to Interpol.To hinder illegal distribution, streaming services employ technologies such as watermarks, either visible to deter piracy or invisible. Digital fingerprinting helps broadcast platforms such as YouTube identify if material is copyrighted. But the most popular weapon against video piracy is to block websites, and that requires government cooperation. In most Asian countries a site can be shut down by law enforcement only if there’s a criminal case against its operators, according to AVIA. Even in nations that have passed laws to allow courts or government agencies to block offending sites, the process is often slow.In Indonesia the association sends a list every 10 days of 50 illicit websites identified by its automated software to the government for rapid blocking. AVIA says more than 3,000 illegal sites have been shuttered since mid-2019. But a follow-up survey the group sponsored last year showed that, while the number of Indonesians accessing illicit websites fell 55%, only 16% of those who formerly accessed the pirate sites went on to subscribe to a paid service. “It’s a whack-a-mole game,” says Chand Parwez Servia, head of the Indonesian Film Board. “The problem is they are faster. What we need is enforcement and court action to go after the operators.”Indonesia’s minister for communications and information technology didn’t respond to requests for comment. The Intellectual Property Office of the Philippines recommended provisions for speedy site-blocking at a congressional committee hearing in February, according to Director General Rowel Barba, who says the agency currently has neither enforcement mechanisms nor the legal authority to take down websites.The heart of the problem, though, is the attitude of viewers, many of whom see nothing wrong in downloading movies. “A lot of users believe that since they’re paying for internet access, whatever is on the internet should be free,” says Maria Yolanda Crisanto, chief sustainability officer at Globe Telecom. “Changing that mindset has been slow.” —With Shirley Zhao'),\n",

       "  'The day was cold and windy. Standing outside the Capitol, the just-sworn-in president called for “a new unity of spirit and purpose” to bind together a nation that had been wracked by a pandemic and high unemployment. His predecessor wasn’t on stage. The inauguration of Warren G. Harding on March 4, 1921, marked the inauspicious, unofficial start of an historic decade. The somber mood gave no hint that America was about to go on a tear.The Roaring Twenties saw widespread adoption of the assembly line, the automobile, radio, motion pictures, indoor plumbing, and labor-saving electric appliances. Consumerism and mass culture took shape. It was the decade of art deco and jazz, Coco Chanel and Walt Disney, The Great Gatsby and the Harlem Renaissance. It was “the first truly modern decade,” says retired Marquette University economic historian Gene Smiley.As the U.S. suffers through another pandemic, it’s tempting to ask whether history will repeat itself. Once the virus passes, will the 2020s roar the way the 1920s did?It’s not impossible. The past year demonstrates that the economy and society can change shape quickly. We’ve seen multiple Covid-19 vaccines developed in record time and an almost-overnight transition to remote work. Tesla Inc. delivered just shy of a half-million electric vehicles in 2020 despite the pandemic. A London-based unit of Alphabet Inc. solved a half-century-old scientific puzzle, using artificial intelligence to predict accurately how proteins fold, which could revolutionize drug discovery.In all probability, though, the U.S. will continue to wrestle with “secular stagnation,” an economic plague of developed nations. Preconditions include an aging population, slow labor force growth, and weak demand for credit, which is why the disease is resistant to traditional monetary remedies. The latest evidence that investors aren’t holding out much hope the coming decade will break out of that mold: The yield on inflation-protected 10-year Treasury notes is around negative 1%, down from 4% during the ’90s tech boom.Despite the differences, by copying what was done right in the Roaring Twenties and avoiding what went wrong, Americans can make the 2020s a success—by today’s standards, anyway.The world of 2021 is “a muddled mix of the Twenties in a lot of ways,” says Rutgers University economist Eugene White. Stock prices are high in relation to corporate profits, as then. Today’s suspicion of international institutions such as the United Nations and World Health Organization would be familiar to a traveler from the 1920s. Race relations are once again strained, though Black Americans are in a far better position than they were a century ago. Tariffs rose under President Donald Trump, as they did in the 1920s. Americans continue to complain about overbearing government, as they did during Prohibition. The 1920s was the first decade in which the rural population was smaller than the urban one; in the 2020s, rural White America is feeling disenfranchised after having gone strong for Trump’s failed reelection.The 1920s didn’t get off to a good start. The Spanish flu pandemic, which killed about 675,000 Americans out of a population of 100 million, was over, but the U.S. was deep into an 18-month downturn marked by the sharpest one-year decline in wholesale and consumer prices in 140 years of record-keeping. The economic miracle of the Twenties didn’t really begin until July 1921, when the recession ended and boom psychology set in.This summer, depending on how vaccinations progress, there will likely be a flicker of that mania as people emerge from their Covid-19 bubbles, ready to party. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg are predicting above-average growth in gross domestic product after a difficult first quarter, with the median forecast peaking at an annualized 4.7% in the third quarter.Indications of pent-up demand are abundant. Carnival Corp., in a sign of confidence in the public’s desire to socialize again, plans to begin boardings in April for its biggest ship ever, the 5,200-passenger Mardi Gras. Finally free to do as they please, Americans may make like the Lost Generation, who chose to “live in the pure moment, live gaily on gin and love,” as the literary critic Malcolm Cowley wrote.Gin and love make a powerful cocktail but won’t sustain a decade’s worth of growth. The bull case for a repeat of the 1920s is that the pandemic lockdown has accelerated the adoption of technologies such as videoconferencing and digital commerce that will keep paying dividends long after the virus is vanquished. McKinsey & Co. says a global survey of executives revealed that they were a “shocking” seven years ahead of where they planned to be in terms of the share of digital or digitally enabled products in their companies’ portfolios. And there’s still headroom. Cowen Research reports that almost half the corporate technology buyers it interviewed said they were in the early stages of a transition to cloud computing.What’s hard about forecasting technological progress is figuring out where we are on the adoption curve. Take robots. The word was coined in 1920 by a Czech playwright, Karel Capek, but a century later robots haven’t lived up to hopes—or fears. It took 13 years, from 2005 to 2018, for the number of installed robots in the U.S. to double, according to the International Federation of Robotics. To a pessimist, that’s almost a plateau. To an optimist, it means robots are still on the bottom of the S-shaped adoption curve and are poised for takeoff at any moment.Bearish forecasters say labor-force expansion and gains in schooling don’t match those of the 1920s, and information technology and biotech breakthroughs, while impressive, don’t measure up to the transformative, general-purpose technologies—electrification and the internal combustion engine, to name two—that powered growth a century ago. As investor Peter Thiel famously said, “We wanted flying cars, instead we got 140 characters.” (It’s 280 characters now, but still.)For the average American, life changed more from 1920 to 1929 than it’s likely to change from 2020 to 2029. Electrification gave us refrigerators (instead of ice boxes), washing machines (instead of washboards and hand-cranked wringers), and radio (instead of your sister at the piano). With electrification, factories no longer had to rely on power from a single engine that was connected to machines via noisy, inefficient belts and pulleys.The internal combustion engine came into its own in the 1920s, powering cars, trucks, farm equipment, and airplanes. The number of registered drivers almost tripled during the decade. The automobile’s rise sparked investment in roads and suburbs as well as production of rubber, steel, glass, and oil.*Median longer-run projections of Federal Reserve’s Federal Open Market Committee members. †Consumer price index for 1920s; personal consumption expenditures index for 2020sData: Bureau of Labor Statistics; Federal Reserve; Robert Gordon, Northwestern University; National Bureau of Economic ResearchRobert Gordon, an economist at Northwestern University, is a leading proponent of the argument that these modern times don’t live up to those modern times. At the request of Bloomberg Businessweek, he assembled figures on labor productivity for the entire economy from 1893 through 2019, clustering the data into roughly equal spans that begin and end at high points in the business cycle. The data up to 1948 come from a book he wrote, The Rise and Fall of American Growth: The U.S. Standard of Living Since the Civil War. For the rest he relied on government figures.The data compiled by Gordon demonstrate that productivity growth jumped in 1920 and remained high for a half-century before slumping after 1973. “While it is likely that productivity growth will revive somewhat in the 2020s from the dismal record of the 2010s,” Gordon wrote in an email, “there is no chance of sustained decade-long growth that matches the achievement of the 1920s.”One lesson, then, is that timing matters. The 1920s roared because technologies that had been nurtured for several decades were finally ready for mass deployment. That may not be the case today.It’s easier to spot social similarities between the decades than economic similarities. Then as now America was divided between a fast-moving, multiethnic, urban society of immigrants and a predominantly White, conservative, rural society pining for a past that it perceived as purer and less tumultuous. Americans elected three Republican presidents in the 1920s—Harding, Calvin Coolidge, and Herbert Hoover. Harding vowed a “return to normalcy,” while Coolidge, a taciturn Vermonter, “appeared to be a reluctant refugee from the previous century,” wrote Nathan Miller in New World Coming: The 1920s and the Making of Modern America.The reformist Progressive Era that began around 1900 had lost its moxie, and the big-government New Deal hadn’t yet arrived. Business was given free rein. “Never before, here or anywhere else, has a government been so completely fused with business,” the Wall Street Journal wrote in 1928. Said Coolidge: “The man who builds a factory builds a temple. The man who works there worships there.” Elon Musk slots in nicely as this century’s answer to Henry Ford, though our society is more skeptical that what’s good for business is good for the country.Gordon calls the 1920s “a Janus-faced decade that defies simple characterization.” It was a time of liberation, in which women got the vote and dared to wear short skirts, smoke cigarettes, and drink bathtub gin, while Black poets, authors, and musicians found wide audiences. “It was the period when the Negro was in vogue,” poet Langston Hughes wrote.But women still faced discrimination, and Black Americans and immigrants faced that and worse. In 1921 a White mob burned more than 1,200 homes in a Black neighborhood in Tulsa, Oklahoma. In 1925 thousands of unmasked Ku Klux Klan members marched down Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington.The Immigration Act of 1924 barred the gates to immigrants from Asia and seriously restricted immigration from southern and eastern Europe—drawing the admiration of none other than Adolf Hitler, who wrote approvingly in Mein Kampf, “The American Union categorically refuses the immigration of physically unhealthy elements, and simply excludes the immigration of certain races.”The 1920s was a time of rising prosperity on the whole but also rising inequality of incomes and wealth and deepening divisions in society. Prohibition, which took effect in 1920, drove a wedge between “drys” and “wets” and fueled organized crime. Factory workers, stock investors, and Big Business mostly did well, but the still-sizable agriculture economy was shocked by a 53% decline in farm product prices in the 1920-21 recession and would take years to recover.The first three years of Trump’s term were likewise marked by a tide of strong economic growth that lifted many boats, though not all. The unemployment rate for Black Americans, for instance, reached a record low. The pandemic has wrecked much of that progress. Bringing the economy back to its potential to lift up the less fortunate is a second reason, after saving lives, for President Biden to accelerate the distribution of vaccines.Perhaps the most important lesson the 2020s can learn from the 1920s is the peril of isolationism. The U.S. emerged from the Great War of 1914-18 as the world’s most powerful economy as well as its biggest creditor, having lent heavily to the Entente Powers to finance the war effort.Yet the U.S. resisted taking on the responsibilities of global leadership. Fed up with Europe and its bloody quarrels, isolationists in Congress prevented the U.S. from joining the League of Nations. With stringent fiscal and monetary policy, the U.S. forced its deflation onto other countries. Washington also insisted that the U.K. and France repay their war debts to the penny. In a vise, those countries raised the money to pay the Americans by exacting reparations from Germany. That fed the resentment among Germans that contributed to the rise of Hitler.Much has changed since then. The U.S. is now a debtor nation, consuming more than it makes. Trump was correct that this is a problem: The U.S. is accumulating debts, while its productive capacity is being hollowed out.What’s similar is that today, as in the 1920s, the U.S. can’t escape the special obligations that go along with being the world’s biggest economy. Americans learned that lesson after the twin disasters of the Great Depression and World War II. The U.S. was instrumental in the founding of the UN, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank and led the push to lower tariff barriers, which enabled poor countries and those ravaged by war to prosper through trade. Nations such as Germany and France set aside imperialist dreams and focused on quality of life. “If you ask an average European man what he cares about, it’s very often soccer,” says Columbia historian Adam Tooze, author of the 2014 book, The Deluge: The Great War, America and the Remaking of the Global Order, 1916-1931.In four years in office, Trump revived isolationism, even resurrecting the “America First” motto that Harding campaigned on in 1920—and that was embraced by the anti-Semitic, fascist-sympathizing America First Committee that fought to keep the U.S. out of World War II.In the absence of U.S. leadership, nations such as Kenya, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Malaysia, and Vietnam are at risk of falling into the orbit of China, says Tooze. “As in the Twenties, we are our own worst enemy,” he says. Biden must attempt to demonstrate that the U.S. is once again a reliable partner.Meanwhile, the notion that the Covid-19 pandemic is some kind of trampoline that will bounce the U.S. toward a bright future is not only off-putting, but wrong. Pandemics enduringly damage societies in ways that go beyond the death toll. In October the IMF released a working paper by senior economist Tahsin Saadi Sedik and economist Rui Xu that uncovered a vicious cycle: Pandemics reduce output and increase inequality, stoking social unrest, which further lowers output and worsens inequality. The study was based on disease outbreaks in 133 countries from 2001 to 2018. “Our results suggest that without policy measures, the COVID-19 pandemic will likely increase inequality, trigger social unrest, and lower future output in the years to come,” the authors wrote.A final lesson of studying the 1920s is simply that history does have something to teach us—a point that the movers and shakers of that frenetic decade sometimes had trouble grasping. “History is more or less the bunk,” Ford said in 1916. “It is tradition. We don’t want tradition. We want to live in the present, and the only history that is worth a tinker’s damn is the history we make today.”Introspection wasn’t the forte of the Roaring Twenties. “Torn nerves craved the anodynes of speed, excitement, and passion,” Frederick Lewis Allen, looking back from the near remove of 1931, wrote in Only Yesterday: An Informal History of the 1920s.Our nerves, too, are torn. But learning from the past can help the healing begin.\\n \\nRead next: What a 1902 Coal Strike Tells Us About Essential Workers Today '),\n",

       "  'Gal Gadot in Wonder Woman 1984.When WarnerMedia announced on Dec. 3 that it would release a year’s worth of movies on HBO Max, its new streaming service, cinephiles and critics bemoaned the demise of theaters. Yet many of the loudest voices were mourning the end of something else: their pathway to astronomical riches.For decades, movie stars and A-list directors have earned both a salary and a share of a movie’s profits, often bolstered by how well a film performs in theaters. Members of the crew, writers, and other actors have made money from residuals: Every time a movie is purchased on DVD or licensed to a TV network, they get a check.But the majority of movies that appear on streaming services don’t get released in theaters. The services pay for them upfront, which means stars, producers, and filmmakers can’t earn the windfalls that come from box-office smashes. “Broadly speaking, the streaming model does have the potential to transfer more of the long-term economic upside from the talent pool—the producers and talent—to the streamer,” says Chris Spicer, head of Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP’s entertainment and media law practice.The most profitable movie of 2019, Avengers: Endgame, generated $900 million for Walt Disney Co., according to Deadline Hollywood. The stars of such big hits can earn massive paydays. Robert Downey Jr. earned a reported $75 million for his salary and share of profits on that film. Yet for every Downey Jr., there are many more producers or financiers who have lost a lot of money chasing a dream: Five films from various studios in 2019 lost more than $100 million each.Streaming services such as Netflix Inc. have offered producers in both TV and film a less volatile alternative. When the service buys a movie, it typically gets all the rights worldwide for a one-time fee, releasing the seller from having to suit the public tastes in scores of foreign markets. A number of filmmakers have found this trade-off hard to resist, especially if it means getting to make a passion project that doesn’t fit into the superhero mold of modern Hollywood.Alfonso Cuaron’s Roma was a black-and-white movie entirely in Spanish, based on his childhood in Mexico City. Few Hollywood studios would have made it. Netflix released it online in 190 countries, as well as in hundreds of theaters, and Cuaron won an Oscar for best director.The success of Netflix and the declining audience for theatrical films have forced every major media company to start making movies for streaming services, a shift that the pandemic has accelerated. But the surprise decision by Warner Bros. to put its 2021 slate on HBO Max and in theaters on the same day has upset the financiers and filmmakers who’d created those movies with the studio, and studio executives have been trying to placate them.The revenue consequences can be dramatic: Wonder Woman 1984, released on Christmas Day in theaters and on HBO Max, made $16.7 million during its opening weekend in U.S. theaters. Its 2017 predecessor made $103 million on its U.S. opening weekend.Warner has spent the past month negotiating new contracts with the producers, stars, and financiers of movies including Dune, The Matrix 4, and In the Heights, offering both guaranteed money upfront and accelerated bonuses for their (albeit limited) theatrical performance. “Our orientation in these situations is always to be generous,” says WarnerMedia Chief Executive Officer Jason Kilar. Although Kilar has stressed this release strategy is a temporary response to the pandemic, most entertainment industry executives expect the company will find it difficult to go back to the old model. “It’s very hard to put the toothpaste back in the tube,” producer Jason Blum says.The majority of the movie business, like the TV business before it, is going online, virus or not. Netflix will release more than 70 movies online in 2021, at the same time or shortly after they appear in theaters. Amazon Prime Video and Hulu will release dozens more.Traditional studios, which have extolled the virtues of the “theatrical experience,” are rushing to produce movies for streaming services owned by their parent companies. Disney will release movies on Disney+, while Searchlight Pictures, producer of one Oscar winner after another, will make movies for Hulu. HBO Max already has original movies. There will still be movies in theaters for weeks or months before they show up at home, but they’ll be in the minority. And even the biggest movies will be offered at home earlier than in the past.“At a macro level, look at the last 15 years in media, the headline as to what you can count on is change,” Kilar says. “The only thing we can count on is change.”\\n \\nRead next: Spotify Bets Big on Podcasts as a Path to Profitability'),\n",

       "  'Subscriptions are fast becoming a way for pandemic-hit industries to get enough cash flow to hang on.Photographer: Maren Caruso (Champagne); Source: MT Sobek (rafting); Source: Manifest (private jet)Phil and Erin Lockwood never imagined their family would be traveling more during the coronavirus pandemic. But since joining the vacation club Inspirato last September, the parents of three have swapped one annual trip to, say, a Disney theme park for villa rentals in Cabo San Lucas and Costa Rica.Inspirato LLC’s new subscription model, starting at $2,500 a month, made it an easy decision for the Lockwoods, who split time between Denver and Coronado, Calif. “Booking a trip usually came with an overwhelming feeling of ‘Where do I start?’ but now it’s like a shopping spree,” says Phil, a 47-year-old marketing agency owner. He is currently prioritizing single-family homes with private pools, full kitchens, and grocery shopping services to avoid sharing amenities with other travelers.While the rest of the tourism industry hangs on for dear life, private travel clubs are on the rise. Booking activity at Inspirato is 30% higher year over year. Its competitors, Exclusive Resorts LLC and Essentialist, reported record-breaking membership sales in 2020.“Trust has become hugely important,” says David Prior, who runs an eponymous two-year-old private travel club. Essentialist CEO Joan Roca agrees, attributing the sector’s growth to the heightened value of expert travel recommendations while navigating the pandemic’s uncertainties.Some clubs charge smaller fees for planning services, and others cost more to secure discounted or even free trips. Either way, accessibility, not exclusivity, has become an undercurrent. Prior Inc. recently dropped its annual membership fee from $2,500 to $249. AllCall, which began in 2019, introduced a model in December that focuses on guided trips in 50 cities and starts at $24 a month.For these purveyors, locking in clients with a recurring fee brings much-needed cash flow and stability in uncertain times, while consumers get a trustworthy partner in a familiar business model.“We budget our lifestyles around subscriptions to gyms, Amazon Prime, Netflix,” says Sean O’Neill, an editor at the travel industry trade site Skift. “People want to travel. Give them a subscription and help plan it, and it’s very appealing.”Members of Manifest pay $2,500 a year for a service that’s half private jet subscription, half travel agency. Trips average between $3,500 and $8,000 per person and include air travel, accommodations at, say, Amangiri resort in Utah, and adventures curated by partners such as MT Sobek. Guides and activities, most meals, and black-car service to and from the airport are also covered.Manifest’s chapters are capped at 175 members and some already have waiting lists. The service is currently in six U.S. cities (including Denver, Phoenix, and Los Angeles) and 12 more are rolling out in 2021. Restaurants are recognizing the benefits of membership, too. The Table22 platform, a Patreon for dining, started in May 2020 to help places diversify income during the pandemic. It has about 100 clients including Il Buco in New York and Chicago’s Lost Lake bar, whose at-home Cocktail Club subscriptions start at $32 a month. A spokesperson for the tropical bar says the arrangement has helped them stay alive, bringing in “low five figures a month.”Strategies differ depending on the place: In Detroit, Takoi has created a monthly ‘cookbook experience’ that sends out kits to recreate dishes from chef Brad Greenhill’s new book.Lindsay and Michael Tusk, owners of the Michelin three-star restaurant Quince in San Francisco, have started started their own private membership club. At Quince & Co., which, for an annual buy-in of $5,000, gets you a $1,000 dining credit as well as bimonthly boxes with provisions from their Fresh Run Farm in Bolinas, Calif., and curated products like homemade pasta.“We need to create a new, stable model. It’s predictive income we can count on,” Lindsay says.When restaurants in California are allowed to reopen, Quince will restart as a space for members and those they refer. In addition to being a benefit for people who have bought in, “we’ll be better able to ensure the safety of guests and staff,” Tusk says. Backers will also be given priority reservations at her other restaurants, Cotogna and Verjus. Early Quince & Co. members include YouTube founder Steve Chen and designer Steven Volpe.“We see this as an opportunity to be invested in the restaurant,” says Lindsay. She estimates that her business is down 75% compared to 2019, and worries that restaurants will face continued uncertainties even post pandemic. “You have a membership at your gym.

       "  'Get everybody in an entire state to spit into a tube? You betcha.Saliva samples from across Minnesota are processed at the Infinity BiologiX facility in Oakdale.The deliveries arrive at the lab four times a day, most in UPS trucks, some by courier, the last usually just before midnight. Each brown bag contains a sealed vial filled with saliva turned bright blue from a fluid that deactivates the coronavirus, if there is any, but preserves the nucleic acid so it can be detected. The lab is on the fourth floor of a building in what will eventually be a biotech hub. It has light sculptures in the lobby, is surrounded by farmland and construction, and is just 10 miles from downtown St. Paul, which is convenient but not nearly as important as its proximity to a United Parcel Service Inc. depot. When the lab opened in Oakdale in late October, the staff used to pile the bags onto standard rolling carts. By early November those were no longer sufficient. They began using bins, but those required them to lean in deep, again and again. By Thanksgiving they’d switched to Gaylord boxes, with sides that easily pull down, which allowed them to more quickly unload the 900 or so samples each one holds.That was a small adjustment among many as the velocity of the virus’s spread increased. Positivity rates, hospitalization rates, intensive care capacity, R-naught, lives lost: There are so many ways to describe the contours of the Covid‑19 pandemic and measure its devastation. Every one of them was moving in the wrong direction by late autumn, first in the states around Minnesota—the Dakotas, Iowa, Wisconsin—then in Minnesota itself. That’s when the state government began an ambitious effort to encourage every resident to be tested—easily, quickly, and for free.Minnesota isn’t the biggest state or the wealthiest. But it has a progressive governor, a budget surplus that’s allowed it to supplement federal funding and spend about $150 million on testing so far, and a well-functioning pandemic task force. It’s home to the Mayo Clinic and the University of Minnesota, one of the nation’s best public research institutions. All those advantages may explain why it’s one of the few states to implement a testing strategy that the federal government should have adopted, one that helped Hong Kong, South Korea, and Taiwan avoid the worst of the pandemic’s ruin, and that doesn’t require dramatic scientific advances or carry any potential health risks. “I love what Minnesota is doing,” says Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health. “We need a lot more of that.”Instead, every U.S. state has been on its own, says Minnesota Governor Tim Walz: “It was a catastrophic failure on the federal level.” Vaccines are coming, slowly, and limited at-home self-testing is now available. But restrictions could be lifted too soon, again, or continue to be dismissed. New, more transmissible variants of the virus will mean increased exposure and infections, and testing may have to be refined to detect these genetic changes. It’s still people vs. the virus. The virus is opportunistic—and people continue to provide it many opportunities. For much of this year, if not longer, testing will be essential. The incoming Biden administration has promised to make it a priority. And even when the pandemic subsides, the coronavirus will remain.Not all of the tests offered in Minnesota in the last months of 2020 relied on saliva samples. But almost every one that did, no matter where in the state it was collected, arrived at this lab in Oakdale. It’s a joint venture of sorts between Minnesota and Infinity BiologiX LLC, which developed the first saliva test authorized for emergency use and runs the facility, and its partner, Vault Health Inc., which oversees the collection of the saliva.One pallet of reagents, with 16 boxes of product—enough for 10,000 tests—seemed like a lot to Jennie Ward, the lab manager, in October. A month later, Minnesota’s positivity rate was 14% and at least 25 pallets were lined up. The lab was going through one pallet a day, then two. If it reached three it would be at its limit, which meant it would be operating every hour of every day and processing 210,000 tests weekly. Just before Thanksgiving the lab had 80 people on staff, a couple of freezers full of positive samples, and new lab coats, tags still on, hanging on a rack in a hall. By year’s end, Ward had plugged in the backup freezers, hired 20 more employees, and ordered extra lab coats. About 400,000 of the state’s 5.6 million residents had tested positive, and the Oakdale lab had processed more than 800,000 tests. “It’s worse than what I expected it to be,” Ward says of the autumn and early winter. “I expected it to be bad. But I didn’t know what bad looked like.”Meredith Vadis had been in charge of the Twin Cities’ wastewater operations, mass transportation, and land use planning. In March she became the state’s chief operating officer for Covid testing, a role she remained in for the rest of the year. Initially, Minnesota’s focus was on testing people with symptoms of the disease and those at high risk, such as employees at food manufacturing plants with outbreaks, hospital workers, and residents and staff at long-term-care facilities. In those early times, Vadis says, the state processed fewer than 2,000 nasal swab samples a day.On May 25, Memorial Day, a Minneapolis police officer killed George Floyd. In the weeks that followed, tens of thousands of people in Minnesota alone protested against racial injustice. The state, like others, encouraged those who’d marched and chanted to get tested. Minnesota pushed past 10,000 tests a day. But the protests didn’t accelerate the spread of the virus; the positivity rate among the demonstrators was never higher than 1.8%.By late summer, after some restrictions were loosened and others ignored, 1,800 people had died and 6,500 were hospitalized. Vadis and the task force adopted a new strategy. The Harvard Global Health Institute had calculated that the state would need to complete 17,500 tests a day to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus in the unyielding Minnesota winter, and 63,500 to suppress it. Health officials had collaborated with the University of Minnesota and the Mayo Clinic in the early months of the pandemic to create the capacity to test as many as 45,000 people a day with nasal swabs. Now it needed the ability to process almost 20,000 more.That’s when Minnesota found Vault, or maybe it was the other way around. Jason Feldman, a former Amazon.com Inc. executive, and Claire Cochrane, a former Blue Apron executive, had started Vault in 2019 as a men’s medical concierge service offering visits at home and online. He’s the chief executive officer; she’s the chief operating officer. After raising $30 million in early 2020, Feldman told TechCrunch, “You tell a guy to go see the doctor about his heart health and he likely won’t, but you tell him you’ll bring him a doctor to help his penis and it’s a different story.” Vault specialized in prescription testosterone therapy and treatments to help reduce anxiety and improve hairlines. It offered its own “sex kit.” It was also working with the genomics lab at Rutgers University to develop a fertility test that would determine the effective age of someone’s sperm. That connection would prove fortuitous: The lab was developing a saliva-based PCR test for the novel coronavirus. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized the test for emergency use at home in May. Vault turned its telemedicine service to focus on Covid, and in August the Rutgers lab became a private company, Infinity BiologiX, backed by private equity. “Everything good that’s happened with Covid is serendipitous,” says Dr. Andrew Brooks, the company’s chief executive and scientific officer. The sperm project, he notes, is ongoing. Vault still sells the sex kit, too.Vadis and the Minnesota task force wanted to make testing so convenient, timely, and accurate that everyone would be able to determine if they were infected, whether they had Covid symptoms or not. Antigen tests, which detect a specific protein in the virus, are inexpensive and quick to process, which is why many public-health officials recommend their widespread use. But antigen tests are also less sensitive than PCR tests, which pick up infections when only a tiny amount of the virus is present. Antigen tests work best when people are at the peak of their infection. Minnesota’s task force didn’t think that would be good enough.Vault’s saliva tests are as sensitive and as accurate as the nasal PCR tests, according to data posted by the FDA. The kits can be sent to people’s homes, and even when administered at testing sites, collecting saliva samples requires fewer medical professionals and less personal protective equipment than using nasal or throat swabs. Spitting into a tube is more comfortable than being swabbed. And the virus is deactivated with a shake of the tube, which takes the worry out of transporting them.The state leased the space for the lab and paid for the equipment—$4.7 million in total. Infinity BiologiX set it up in eight weeks. When the day comes that Minnesota no longer needs it, Infinity BiologiX will keep the equipment—the Chemagic 360 machines named Shelly, Randy, Timmy, and Jimmy, after characters from South Park; and the QuantStudio 5s named Morticia and Gomez, after The Addams Family. In the meantime, Minnesota receives discounted prices on the tests themselves and a promise from the companies to process as many as 30,000 a day and make results available within 48 hours after the samples arrive at the lab. Minnesota has set aside at least $30 million for the program. Feldman says Michigan, New Mexico, and Wyoming also want Infinity BiologiX labs, but this winter, with federal funding uncertain, they haven’t had the budget.Minnesotans swarmed the 10 community testing sites as soon as they began saliva collection in late October, “tailgating for testing in the parking lot before we opened,” says Vadis. Vault brought in people from Walt Disney Co. with experience in line management. It trained members of the National Guard to oversee the collection process. Many of them are medical practitioners of some sort, says Feldman, though they don’t have to be. It takes about 30 minutes to learn how to supervise the spitting and package the specimen. There’s also cultural training. “We’re teaching the guards to be super approachable, so no one is intimidated,” Feldman says. Minnesota is home to sizable populations of Somalis and Hmong, and finding enough staff who can translate medical terms in their languages has proved challenging.Vadis, who’s been regularly tested, has advice for first-timers: Get some pickles. “You can’t eat them until you’re done, but if you smell them it helps produce saliva.” The tests require a lot of saliva. She sometimes picks up pickles at an Arby’s drive-thru. In a pinch, lemons will help, too.By early November the positivity rate in Minnesota was more than 15%, and in places such as St. Cloud it was reaching 30%. Doctors and nurses in the Twin Cities reported shortages of beds in intensive care units and long waits for patients in emergency rooms. Vault opened its online registration for home testing kits on Nov. 12, and 30,000 people signed up. UPS and Vault itself were overwhelmed, Vadis says. That Sunday, the obituaries in the Star Tribune filled more than 10 pages. Over the next week, people ordered 153,000 tests.The kits didn’t come back at the expected rates. It turned out people were hoarding them. “We know that Minnesotans are really into free stuff,” Vadis says. “They’ll order the tests because they’re free, but they won’t use them.” She’d prefer people not do that. “It’s not a great idea to have one in your medicine cabinet like a box of Band-Aids.” So far almost 400,000 kits have been requested, and fewer than 150,000 have been returned to the lab.Minnesotans overwhelmed Vault’s online customer service, too, in the nicest possible ways. Spit supervisors used to begin the Zoom call: “Have you had any recent exposure to anyone with the virus?” Minnesotans would often take the opportunity to share all sorts of details from the past two weeks of their lives. Some asked questions about the pandemic. Others had ideas about how to fight it. Many just wanted to chat. Vault had to change the script. Now the supervisors are explicit: “I’m going to ask you a series of yes-or-no questions.”In January, Minnesota announced that because saliva tests are easier to administer, and the Oakdale lab can handle more samples, that will be the only kind of test it offers at its 20 community sites.A few days after the Vault lab opened, Dr. Deborah Birx, the coordinator of the White House response to the pandemic, visited the state and said: “We have deep concern about Minnesota at this moment.” She recommended that every person from age 18 to 35, more than a million in all, be tested before Thanksgiving and again before the end of the year. Young adults were reporting the highest case rates, seemed most likely to be asymptomatic if infected, were still social, and were headed home for the holidays.One of the state’s epidemiologists asked all the higher education institutions to test their students, with help from Vault in some cases, community health clinics in others. “They said, ‘You betcha.’ It’s Minnesota,” says Dan Huff, assistant commissioner for the Health Protection Bureau. The administration at Gustavus Adolphus College in St. Peter sent emails and texts to tell everyone on campus about the one-day program. They asked coaches to prod their players, teachers to remind their students. They offered thousand-piece jigsaw puzzles to the first 250 people who showed up and AirPod Pros and a JBL speaker as prizes.About a hundred people stood in line outside the gymnasium on a bright and cold Friday, Nov. 13, waiting for the testing to begin. More wore masks than hats. By day’s end about 60% of the school’s 1,800 eligible students had been tested, along with almost 200 faculty and staff. Only 20 came back positive.But throughout the state the situation had gotten worse faster than most people expected. On Nov. 19, a week before Thanksgiving, the governor issued a statement. It had taken 29 weeks to reach 100,000 infections in Minnesota and only an additional six to reach 200,000. He expected that in just three more, the total would be close to 300,000. He ordered bars and restaurants to stop serving indoors, and gyms and theaters to close. That rendered the effort to test young adults specifically less crucial just as it was getting under way. In all, about 380,000 people were tested in Minnesota the week before Thanksgiving. Vadis says it’s hard to know for sure how many were 18 to 35 years old.After the governor’s executive order, the task force set a new winter priority: to make sure all those who held critical jobs could be tested. “How?” asks Huff. “I don’t know. We’re going to figure that out.” He and Vadis are pragmatic. They know all their efforts make up just one slice of what epidemiologists call the Swiss cheese approach to disease protection. “We know you can’t test your way out of this pandemic,” says Michael Osterholm, an epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota and an adviser to the incoming Biden administration. But in Minnesota, he says, “it absolutely would have been worse without the testing.” Governor Walz notes that when North Dakota and South Dakota had the highest positivity rates in the nation, Minnesota was ranked 21st. “Our strategy was effective,” he says. “But its effectiveness was blunted by the sheer magnitude of cases.”At the lab, the only thing that isn’t changing is the process itself. That’s not allowed. It has 12 steps and takes four to six hours. On this November day, the morning batch has already arrived. As samples come in, the outside of each collection tube is decontaminated with an ethanol solution. Employees log the tubes into the computer, then uncap them and slot them into racks, which are placed on a Janus machine. The Janus transfers a bit of saliva from each tube into its own small vial, placing 96 samples on a plastic plate that looks like a honeycomb. It’s put in a Chemagic 360 machine, which uses magnetic rods and beads to protect the viral RNA and a buffer solution to remove everything else.What remains is a purified genetic sample. The plate is combined with three others to produce a single new plate, the size of two mobile phones stacked together, that holds a tiny portion of the spit sent in by 384 people. Then comes the PCR testing. The plate runs through a thermocycler, which heats and cools it in a preset pattern. Attached fluorescent markers grow with each cycle, eventually signaling if the virus is present. At the end of the day, the vials containing samples determined to be negative are disposed of. The positive ones are stored in the deep freezers for future research—including tracking genetic changes in the virus. Vault notifies people of their results within 24 hours of completing the test.The lab processes so many samples that certain supplies can be hard to come by, Ward, the manager, says as she walks from room to room. Some supplies, such as reagents, are crucial—if the lab doesn’t have the specific ones it needs, it can’t operate. (That’s never happened.) Other items can be replaced. Pipettes and tips are used to siphon the saliva from each sample. At one point they were unavailable in the quantities required, and the lab had to find a new vendor and invest in equipment to ensure a steady supply. The staff prefers screw caps on the test tubes, which are easier to use, but for a while had to make do with push caps instead. Because the lab’s supplier had temporarily run out of the labels needed to create bar codes, Ward had stopped at a Staples on her way into work that morning to pick up some.Test kits for the staff are stacked along a wall of Ward’s office; snacks—apples and oranges, nuts and protein bars—are piled on top of her desk. Around noon, she gets a call. The lunch she ordered for everyone has arrived. She gets another call. Samples from some of Minnesota’s first responders are on the way. Those get expedited. “Call me when you’re at the curb,” she tells the driver. “I’ll run down.” '),\n",

       "  'No more FONO. How to recognize and break the habit of “toxic positivity.”Illustration: Simone NoronhaWant to live richly? Sign up here for our newsletter featuring the best of Bloomberg Pursuits, delivered weekly.When her patient started talking about sick notes, neuropsychologist Judy Ho decided to intervene. Her client, a wildly successful entrepreneur, was rich, happily married, and well-regarded by his peers.The problem was the days when he felt depressed and run-down but unable to admit it. The only way to address it, he felt, was to regress, like a schoolboy, and look for permission from a doctor to regroup. “He knew he wasn’t sick, but he’d go in and make something up,” she says, “just so he could take a day off and be OK with himself.”She recognized he was suffering from a surging contemporary malaise. “He always had to demonstrate his worth to people,” she continues. “He was thinking, ‘I must exude this image of success and a happy life that everybody has come to know about me, and I don’t want to ever change that image.’ That’s toxic positivity.”Call it FONO, or fear of a negative outlook. Also known as “dismissive positivity,” it’s expressed as an overbearing cheerfulness no matter how bad things are, a pep that denies emotional oxygen to anything but a rictus grin.You see it on Instagram, where the affective filter is always upbeat, usually followed by the hashtag #blessed. You hear it from the SoulCycle instructor exhorting every rider to swaggeringly sweat through the pain. It’s available from the newly anointed chief creative officer for Vital Proteins, actress Jennifer Aniston, who claims that renewal isn’t only a result of its powders: Instead, “it’s within us.” You might even recognize it in the boss who insists that colleagues start every Zoom meeting by sharing a piece of good news to help keep moods buoyant amid the gloom.Think of this mindset as one that responds to all human anxiety, or sadness, with uncompromising optimism. It can be found in sentences that start with those negating words “At least,” which are followed by a suggestion that however bad you’re feeling, at least you’ve got plenty else that should offset and outweigh it. Even the oppressive insistence that we should love our body, no matter what, can tip into upbeat intolerance by implying that it’s not OK to want to work on tummy folds or laugh lines.790%: Increase in part-time and full-time life coaches worldwide since 2001FONO can power any delusional self-belief, whether it’s politicians trying to spin their way out of Covid-19 failures with platitudes about strength or hucksters selling a chance to get ahead. The Federal Trade Commission has reported an uptick in Ponzi schemes during the pandemic—70% higher in the second quarter of 2020 than the year before. Ordinary Americans, casting around for inspiration and reassurance, became prime targets for these peddlers of perkiness.Such magical thinking has paralleled the rise of professionals hired to be a personal cheerleader. Membership of the International Coaching Federation, a credentialing and training program accrediting body, has soared from almost 4,700 worldwide in 2001 to more than 41,000 today.Successful people are the most likely to fall prey to this way of thinking, says Naomi Torres-Mackie. As head of research at the Mental Health Coalition and a practicing psychologist at New York’s Lenox Hill Hospital, she works extensively with patients trapped on what she calls “the achievement treadmill.” That’s where self-doubt and reflection are elbowed aside in favor of a gung-ho, can-do spirit.Take the recently married financier she treated. At the pinnacle of his career, his sole identifiable problem was sleeplessness. As he worked with Torres-Mackie, the Wall Streeter recognized the cause was his singular fixation during waking hours on how he compared with others.“The only questions he asked himself were ‘How much success am I having, and what is my boss thinking?’\\u2009” she says. “He was so focused on putting out a picture-perfect happy and positive image, it left him no room at all to process and digest the tough stuff.” Only after lying down at night would those concerns come to the fore and keep him awake. His treatment afterward centered on breaking the connection he’d forged between seeming happy and being successful.For the current generation, the origins of this emotional cure-all lie in the 1990s, when then-president of the American Psychological Association, Martin Seligman, posited that pessimism is a learned behavior. Therefore it both could and should be avoided.“Some of the best moments in life, when you truly feel good, are full of mixed emotions”That observation snowballed into bestsellers such as The Secret, first published in 2006 by Australian TV executive-turned-author Rhonda Byrne. It was popularized after Oprah Winfrey championed its ethos. That breakout bunkum bible was essentially built on claims that the power of positive thinking would provide whatever you want, be it a baby or a Mercedes-Benz. This past summer it was turned into a straight-to-video movie starring Katie Holmes.Contemporary corporate culture exacerbates these tendencies. Pre-pandemic, employees were urged to be happy because they worked in an office, perhaps, with pingpong tables and free lunches. Now, in a work-from-home world, they’re urged to be grateful simply to have a job.Whitney Goodman, a psychotherapist in Miami, explains that such workplaces create a Catch-22 where employees aren’t able to raise concerns for fear they won’t be seen as a team player or worthy of a promotion; stuck with unexpressed concerns, they’re more likely to fail in the end. (Her new book, Toxic Positivity, will be released under an imprint of Penguin Random House later this year.) Clinical reports underscore her thesis. A 2018 study published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology echoed previous research when it found that people felt more sad when they were expected to conceal such emotions. Brett Ford, a psychology professor at the University of Toronto and one of the study’s authors, says tackling toxic positivity requires staring down, rather than past, uncomfortable feelings. “Notice them, let them be, try not to push them away,” she says, “and they will pass. Emotions are supposed to be relatively short-lived experiences.”Ho, the neuropsychologist, has an unexpected suggestion to help calibrate a Pollyanna perspective: a session watching Disney-Pixar’s Inside Out, which animates and dramatizes human emotions. “One of the best antidotes to toxic positivity is reexamining your value system and understanding that some of the best moments in life, when you truly feel good, are full of mixed emotions,” she says. “And that’s what we should be embracing as human beings.”Along with yourself, allowing others to express negativity is vital, too. Banish the words “at least” from your emotional vocabulary, Ho recommends, and instead focus on reflective listening. “Repeat back what you think you heard, without adding anything to it. You don’t always have to Band-Aid something, or ask, ‘What can I do?’\\u2009”It’s no surprise that Byrne would also return now. Her sequel, The Greatest Secret, came out in November. Read it, the blurbs tout, and you can remove all negativity—as if doing so should be a central goal in life. (More than 80% of Amazon.com Inc.’s user reviews gave it five stars. It would be too negative to be negative, it seems.)“This year, with crisis on top of crisis, we’ve gone back to the instinctive ways of coping pounded into us from a young age—that we need to be positive to get through this,” Goodman says. “It’s true that we need to have some awareness this isn’t going to last forever, but we also have to attend to the fact that, well, this isn’t normal.”'),\n",

       "  'The music-streaming service is staking its future on finding more Joe Rogans.When Spotify went public in April 2018, Daniel Ek had been struggling with this question for more than a decade: How would the company make money? The Swedish entrepreneur had saved the music business from 15 years of declining sales with an app that can stream millions of songs on demand. But in exchange for that bottomless buffet, he agreed to return more than 70% of every dollar Spotify earned to rights holders. So despite building the most popular paid music service in the world—it would take in $6.1 billion in sales in 2018—Spotify Technology SA hadn’t turned a profit since Ek co-founded it in 2006. Wall Street is obviously capable of forgiving years of a company’s losses (see Amazon, Netflix, Tesla, etc.). But investors have never made sense of Spotify’s business model. For every $5 that comes in, about $3.75 goes right back out.Ek had long argued that the answer would come from changing how the music business operated. Three record label groups control the majority of new music releases, giving them power over Spotify in negotiations. But Ek thought streaming would begin an era when artists didn’t need labels. Musicians could use social media to promote their work and Spotify to distribute it. “The old model favored certain gatekeepers,” he wrote in a letter to prospective investors in February 2018. “Today, artists can produce and release their own music.”Shortly after going public, Spotify unveiled a feature that let artists upload music directly to its app. Without intermediaries, performers got a larger share of royalties, and Spotify kept more money. The company tested the feature with a handful of artists—Chicago rapper Noname was an early adopter—and expanded the trial to a few hundred participants that September. But most artists weren’t ready to forgo the help they get from labels to promote their work, especially since millions of people use services other than Spotify, and the labels didn’t like being circumvented. By December its stock had slipped to a low of $106.84, a drop of more than 20% from April, and doubts about the company’s long-term viability grew. In July 2019, Spotify ended the program.Ek wanted to build a business the labels couldn’t touch, and there was another massive audience up for grabs. The number of people in the U.S. listening to podcasts monthly had grown from 32 million in 2010 to 73 million in 2018. Although the vast majority of them used the iPhone’s podcast app, Apple Inc. had never converted it into a revenue stream: Podcasts get money from ads, which Apple doesn’t sell. Outside the U.S., where most of Spotify’s users reside, there was no dominant player. Spotify had already dethroned Apple as the king of online music. Maybe it could do the same in podcasting.In the past two years, Spotify has spent close to $900 million acquiring podcast production and technology companies. And it’s spent millions more on exclusive rights to shows from celebrities such as Kim Kardashian and TikTok star Addison Rae. Two of its most popular programs are comedian Joe Rogan’s The Joe Rogan Experience and The Michelle Obama Podcast, and Spotify expects new shows from Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan Markle, to put up big numbers, too. Spotify now hosts almost 2 million podcasts, up from 2,500 three years ago, and has more than 600 exclusives. Apple still has the most listeners in the U.S., but Spotify has narrowed the gap. And it’s No.\\u20091 in many overseas markets.The company has already converted more than 20% of its 320 million total users—about 70 million people globally—into podcast listeners. The larger the audience gets, the easier it is to pry ad dollars from radio and TV; Spotify’s ultimate goal is dual revenue streams from ads and subscriber fees. “If you look at the amount of people listening, how young the demographic is, anyone would look at that and say this is going to be the next big medium,” says Dawn Ostroff, the company’s chief content officer.Many of Spotify’s biggest partners and competitors, including record labels, advertisers, and talent agents, question if it’s wasting money on a niche business. In 2019 the podcasting industry generated less than $1 billion in U.S. ad sales, a fraction of the $14 billion captured by radio. Apps such as Luminary, which charge customers for original shows, haven’t worked. “The audience for podcasts has grown, and Spotify’s share is growing,” says Michael Morris, an analyst at Guggenheim Partners LLC. “It’s still not clear what that will mean in terms of money.”Courtney Holt thought short-form video would solve Spotify’s money problems. He joined the company in 2017 after a stint at Maker Studios Inc. (now Disney Digital Network), which sold ads and provided tools, services, and data for thousands of YouTube channels. He’d seen up close the growing audience for video and thought Spotify could create a product like Snapchat’s Discover page, where original series sit alongside videos from TMZ and the Daily Mail. Spotify had already licensed clips from ESPN and Comedy Central and produced original series from Russell Simmons, Tim Robbins, and other celebrities; shows were as much as 15 minutes long and included dance competitions and documentaries. But they were parked in a video tab on the app and got little promotion. Holt realized he couldn’t compete with YouTube and Facebook Inc. People didn’t come to Spotify for video, and it was expensive to produce, anyway.Podcasting was accounting for a growing share of overall activity on Spotify. In Germany the app was the most popular way people listened to podcasts thanks to a 2016 partnership with comedy talk show Fest & Flauschig. Its success convinced Spotify that the format deserved a closer look. “We saw that the people consuming podcasts were more highly engaged,” Holt says. “Why not take advantage of the millions of Spotify users we could convert into podcast listeners?”Data: Edison ResearchAt the time, Spotify’s library had only a few thousand shows, mostly about music. There were no executives dedicated to licensing or talking to people in the industry. Holt’s team started securing licenses from thousands of creators, convincing them Spotify could expose their shows to a younger audience than listened elsewhere. Engineers built out a home in the app for podcasting, creating a landing page and copying features from the music service, such as customized playlists. Spotify also started buying exclusive rights, starting with comedian Amy Schumer and talk show host Joe Budden.Hosting exclusives, the thinking went, would persuade people to commit to Spotify as their main podcasting service. Budden’s show was popular prior to the company’s involvement, and it amassed a large following on the app. Schumer’s podcast didn’t catch on right away; Spotify lacked the infrastructure at the time to advise her on production or content, and there wasn’t much of a promotion strategy outside the app. (The show still airs.) Executives realized they needed help.In February 2019, Spotify announced it would acquire Gimlet Media Inc., a podcast studio, and Anchor, a tech company, for about $340 million. Founded by radio journalist Alex Blumberg and media executive Matthew Lieber, Gimlet had a reputation as the HBO of podcasting—the home for premium storytelling. Anchor made Spotify the podcasting equivalent of YouTube, enabling people to upload shows to the service. The next month, Spotify announced a deal for another studio, Parcast. Ek declared it was a new era for his company. “We believe that over time more than 20% of all listening on Spotify will be nonmusic content,” he said on a call with analysts. The number of podcasts on the service climbed from 185,000 at the end of 2018 to 700,000 at the end of 2019, and more than 40 million users were listening to them.The experience with Budden and Schumer taught Spotify execs that it’s easier to buy an audience than build one. Rogan, the industry’s biggest and most controversial star, has attracted a massive following by creating a forum for stand-ups, mixed martial artists, moguls, scientists, assorted galaxy-brain free-speech absolutists, and people such as Gavin McInnes, founder of the neofascist Proud Boys. Rogan had never offered his podcast on Spotify, but in May 2020 the company agreed to pay him as much as $100 million for his show and, eventually, the exclusive rights. As part of the arrangement, Spotify committed to stay out of Rogan’s way.Since the deal, he’s interviewed the author of Irreversible Damage: The Transgender Craze Seducing Our Daughters, whose concerns about people transitioning at young ages are widely criticized as anti-trans. For the third time, he hosted conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, who’s promoted the false claim that the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut never happened. (Jones was sued for defamation by eight families of victims, though not for comments he made in conversation with Rogan. In a deposition, he acknowledged that the shooting happened and blamed “psychosis” for his statements.) Apple, Facebook, YouTube—as well as Spotify—had banned Jones’s show Infowars for violating their terms of service. Employees petitioned Spotify to punish Rogan for hosting guests that spread misinformation and hate. Ek heard their concerns at multiple internal meetings, but he declined to discipline Rogan. While Ostroff, the chief content officer, says Rogan’s show must meet corporate standards, she doesn’t tell him whom to book. “We are very happy with the deal,” she says.The Joe Rogan Experience is Spotify’s most popular podcast globally, topping the charts in more than 15 markets, according to the company. Spotify shares rose more than 10%, to $175.01, the day it announced the deal. Wall Street sees Rogan benefiting Spotify much as House of Cards did Netflix Inc. When it began airing in 2013, the political thriller starring Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright attracted millions of new subscribers—and reduced Netflix’s dependence on rival studios, much as podcasts lessen Spotify’s reliance on Sony Music, Universal Music Group, and Warner Music Group.Throughout 2020, Ostroff and Holt pursued podcasts from life coach Brené Brown and Kardashian; commissioned shows based on DC Comics characters (the first is Batman Unburied); and struck a multiyear deal with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, who’ll start producing and hosting programs this year. From Gimlet, Spotify gets reported series such as Reply All, which investigates internet culture, and Resistance, which explores recent civil rights movements. Parcast churns out addictive titles like Serial Killers and Political Scandals that are cheap to produce and sound like someone’s reading a Wikipedia entry. The Ringer, a sports media company founded by popular podcaster Bill Simmons, provides many of Spotify’s sports and pop culture shows. Podcasts that don’t fit in those buckets—including those from Obama, Kardashian, and other tentpoles—fall under what’s known internally as Studio Four. (Employees at Gimlet, Parcast, and the Ringer are negotiating with management for better pay and more control over how their shows get turned into movies, TV shows, and books. Spotify has said little publicly about the talks.)With its huge user base, Spotify often dictates what’s a hit. The Michelle Obama Podcast, in which the former first lady talks to friends, family, and celebrities, surged up the charts with constant promotion on the app. The same goes for The Journal, a daily podcast about the Wall Street Journal’s newsroom. Even so, marketers have been reluctant to commit to ads, because it’s hard to know if people hear their promotions. Most podcast services can tell advertisers that a show was downloaded but not if anyone listened. No one company sells ads at the scale YouTube does with video, and the vast majority of podcasts have no advertising, says Jay Richman, a vice president in charge of Spotify’s ad business.Richman says he’s solved the problem with a technology called streaming ad insertion. It lets Spotify serve an ad when a listener gets to a certain point in an episode, so marketers pay only for an ad that’s heard (or played, at least). The feature is available on select shows, with a wider rollout in progress. Since Spotify sells the ad, it can provide data about when and how someone is listening—on a phone, say, or a tablet.This helped persuade Catherine Sullivan to commit $20 million to Spotify in July. Before an internal promotion, she was chief investment officer for North American operations at Omnicom Media Group, which buys ads for companies including Disney, Google, and McDonald’s. She started looking to invest in podcasting in late 2019 and talked to other major participants, including Pandora Media LLC and IHeartMedia Inc., but she ultimately decided against investing with them. “If it continues to grow at a 15-to-20% clip when everything else is declining, it will continue to siphon money away,” Sullivan says.In the ad world, $20 million is minuscule—TV networks make more during one quarter of the Super Bowl. But a commitment of that size was a first for podcasting and possibly a sign of more to come. Sullivan compares it to early ad deals with Snapchat and Twitter Inc., which, she says, “started small, and then they start scaling.”Spotify’s outsize investment in podcasting almost guarantees that it will supplant Apple as the world’s No.\\u20091 distributor. But is the company creating a business or a bubble? It’s spent millions of dollars buying shows it gives away for free and will continue to lose money on podcasts for at least a few years. It’s had little success reducing payments to the record labels.Spotify’s competitors are making investments of their own. Apple, which has the second-most-popular streaming service with Apple Music, is funding original series and plans a larger overhaul of its podcasting business. Amazon.com Inc. is Spotify’s biggest rival for programming, buying shows for its music app and its audiobook service, Audible. In December, Amazon announced it is acquiring Wondery, a major podcast producer, for its music service. (Bloomberg LP, which owns Bloomberg Businessweek, has partnered with Wondery on the podcast The Shrink Next Door.) Holt says that more big players validate Spotify’s investment: “We were the ones to say we’re going to go make this a real thing. If we are great, that’s great for Spotify. If others see greatness and want to copy, cool.”Spotify executives speak with some certainty about how podcasting will solve the company’s profitability problem. If it happens, it’ll take some time. Ek has sold investors on a future in which shows from Rogan and the royals reduce Spotify’s reliance on record labels and lift it to profitability. His dealmaking has bought him time to deliver on that promise: The company’s stock price more than doubled in 2020, boosting its valuation from about $27 billion to more than $60 billion. But ad sales stayed largely unchanged, and estimates put losses at more than $300 million.Still, listeners are loyal to their favorite hosts, attending live tapings in the pre-Covid era and buying merchandise. This could let Spotify charge customers added fees for podcasts without ads, or open up additional lines of business, such as TV adaptations. Podcasts could turn Spotify from a technology platform with bad margins into a media business with decent ones.To make this work, the company needs to find the next Joe Rogan. It’s also targeting new audiences by making shows in multiple languages and experimenting with formats. Currently, Spotify operates studios in 17 countries, where it’s adapting popular shows from the U.S. into local languages and developing regional hits. Fausto, a true-crime series about a 1991 murder in the city of Ecatepec, topped Spotify’s charts in Mexico in 2019, and the second season started in November. The top news podcast in Brazil is Café da Manhã (Breakfast, in Portuguese), a collaboration with the newspaper Folha de São Paulo; Spotify now produces versions of it in Argentina, Chile, and Colombia. One of its most popular podcasts in Indonesia is a talk show hosted by four former radio personalities that replicates conversations in neighborhood shops, or warungs.In 2020, Spotify introduced a feature that lets creators combine songs and talk into one program. Early tests in this genre include 60 Songs That Explain the ’90s, hosted by music journalist Rob Harvilla, and Rock This With Allison Hagendorf, featuring interviews with Foo Fighters and Smashing Pumpkins lead singer Billy Corgan.The most popular new podcast on Spotify is The Get Up. The daily morning show opens with headlines and then intersperses songs with pretaped talk segments on subjects such as self-care, pickup lines, and music. It’s hosted by Kat Lazo, a YouTube creator turned video producer; Xavier “X” Jernigan, a podcaster and Spotify exec; and Speedy Morman, who anchors video series for the media company Complex.Morning shows have long been a staple of FM radio, where the most popular stations marry well-known hosts with hit songs, such as on The Breakfast Club in New York or Big Boy’s Neighborhood in Los Angeles. But unlike radio, which offers everyone the same music, The Get Up serves up tailored playlists based on what Spotify’s algorithm thinks a person wants to hear. The show has had more than 1 million listeners since it started in October, according to Lydia Polgreen, Gimlet’s head of content. “We’re really, really excited about how well it’s going,” says Polgreen, who was previously editor-in-chief of Huffington Post. That’s because The Get Up has already delivered in a key way, by getting people who use Spotify solely for music to consider something else.In a November episode, the hosts talked about how the pandemic had been make-or-break for many relationships. They shared their own dating history, too: “My family asks me what feels like every other day why I’m still single,” Morman said. Although the hosts hadn’t met before they started taping, they’ve developed a rapport. Jernigan and Morman tease Lazo about her frugality, while Jernigan is often mocked for his knowledge of arcane facts. They’ve turned the latter into a segment called “Stump X,” in which Jernigan answers trivia questions. “It’s an ever-changing show,” Morman says after taping. “I just wanna put emphasis on the fact that it’s growing and evolving.” '),\n",

       "  '2021-01-12',\n",
       "  'Lockdowns showed many wealthy finance workers they didn’t need to be in the main office, and they’re flocking to sunshine and low taxes.Construction cranes pirouette above the skyline in Miami. Porsches are selling briskly in Coral Gables. Over in Palm Beach, along Worth and Hibiscus avenues, the Gucci set is counting new neighbors. The scent of fresh money hangs over Florida these days like the sweet smell of orange blossoms. In the midst of a deadly pandemic—and in truth, largely because of it—an optimism has taken hold among the state’s boosters.Locals are buzzing again that the Miami area might finally realize a long elusive dream of becoming Wall Street South. Several prominent financial companies, including the mighty Goldman Sachs Group Inc., are considering moving some business there, or are relocating outright. And in these days of working from home, Florida’s low taxes, year-round warm weather, and emerald golf links are already luring some Wall Street people down from New York.To David Greenberg, a former board member of the New York Mercantile Exchange who helps run a family investment office in Boca Raton, news that Goldman may move its asset-management division here was a watershed moment for the Sunshine State. “There’s no way to put that genie back in the bottle,” says Greenberg.Maybe. This sultry home of tourism, cruise ships, and retirees has been trying to diversify its economy for generations, with mixed success. Such traditional business hubs as Wall Street, Hollywood, and Silicon Valley didn’t sprout overnight. Gaining critical mass takes time. Even as Miami’s Brickell neighborhood transformed into Florida’s version of Manhattan a decade ago, the state has attracted only a smattering of mostly small to medium-size hedge funds, family offices, and banks looking for a convenient hub for Latin American wealth management. In research firm Z/Yen’s Global Financial Centres Index, the Miami area doesn’t even make a cameo.But Covid-19 may just be the catalyst for a shift. For months, New York stock traders, portfolio managers, and investment bankers scattered across the U.S. Many headed south to spacious homes with private pools. Now, as the vaccine rollout begins and firms look toward a post-pandemic world, some are realizing that their employees don’t want to return to their old lives in Manhattan high-rises.It’s easy to see why the Wall Street South idea resonates: Bankers can enjoy an outdoor lifestyle and also justify their existence, because there are so many rich clients milling around. South Florida is one of the most ostentatiously wealthy places on the planet, home to two of America’s three richest ZIP codes.The 2017 tax overhaul, which capped the federal deduction on state and local taxes at $10,000, only increased Florida’s tax advantage over areas such as New York and New Jersey. And while Miami isn’t cheap—in fact, rents are far out of proportion with service-sector-driven median income—the price per square foot of a condo in the Brickell district is about a quarter of the cost in Manhattan, according to appraiser Miller Samuel Inc.Doug Cifu, chief executive officer of electronic market-maker Virtu Financial Inc., says his company’s decision to open a new office in suburban Palm Beach Gardens is simply “rational.” He expects employees to save an average 10% to 11% on taxes, and much more on housing. “In terms of the quality of life, from my perspective, it is far superior in Florida now than it is in New York, and I don’t see that changing in the near to medium term,” he says.There have been a series of pushes over the years to expand Florida’s footprint in industries beyond tourism. Its airports and seaports have transformed it into a major force in global trade; it’s become a hub for Spanish-language media and entertainment; and there’s a booming health-care industry that caters to one of America’s oldest populations. At the same time, tourism’s slice of the Florida economic pie has kept growing. Disney World opened in Central Florida in 1971, the cruise industry blossomed into a Miami-based behemoth in the 1980s and ’90s, and Art Basel Miami Beach became a key attraction starting in 2002. Hospitality, arts, and entertainment account for about 6.1% of Florida’s gross domestic product.The lack of critical mass for finance firms may itself have been a deterrent for companies coming to the area, says Sean Snaith, an economist with the University of Central Florida, who now sees it likely that more moves will be announced. Says Jenni Morejon, CEO of the Fort Lauderdale Downtown Development Authority: “There has to be a tipping point, and once one or two of these companies plant their flag down here, then it does start a cycle.”In a matter of months, firms including Paul Singer’s Elliott Management Corp. and Tom Barrack’s Colony Capital Inc. have put in motion relocations to Florida, while Blackstone Group Inc. and Citadel are setting up offices there. Other workers who flocked to the state as a Covid haven are simply choosing to stay, a move investment banking honcho Ken Moelis has already blessed for employees at his firm, Moelis & Co.Kevin Couper, a senior vice president at Wealthspire Advisors, arrived from California in July after being asked to help open and manage the company’s new office in Boca Raton. At first, he was attracted by Florida’s relatively relaxed coronavirus restrictions, but says he’s come to appreciate the easier lifestyle and his increased disposable income. “I was very used to a higher cost of living, higher income tax,” says Couper, 34, who has also lived in New Jersey. “Here, both went down, cost of living is less—at least where I am—and rent, too. Everything has been better.”Miami Mayor Francis Suarez has been on a quest to diversify even further beyond Wall Street South, tweeting prolifically about luring technology companies to the region—a sort of Silicon Beach. Suarez is pushing to increase money available through the Miami Downtown Development Authority to finance and tech businesses moving into the urban core, potentially raising grants from a current $150,000 per business or boosting the pool of funds so that more can benefit. The incentives can seem paltry if you’re a multibillion-dollar hedge fund, but movers say they’re glad to be courted, accusing governments in the Northeast and California of taking them for granted. “It’s just trying to capture the moment,” Suarez says.The Florida Department of Economic Opportunity’s own projections are modest in their assumptions about finance job growth. The department forecasts 432,668 finance and insurance jobs in the state by 2028, a 5.7% increase and less than the projected 13.2% jump in Florida jobs overall. Wall Street-type employment—involving securities, commodities contracts, and other financial investments—is expected to climb 12.8%, but it’s still a relatively small sliver, at 56,227 positions. In the Miami metro area, it’s expected to hit 22,795 jobs.Workers hoping they can move to paradise and keep their Manhattan paycheck may also be disappointed. The average salesperson peddling securities, commodities, and financial services makes $149,880 in wages in the New York metro area, compared with $88,220 in metro Miami, which includes Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Financial and investment analysts make about 43% less in Miami than in New York, the data show.There are also challenges to living in the Sunshine State, as the pandemic has made clear, including the crash of its unemployment website and a chaotic vaccine rollout. It’s also one of the parts of the world that stands to be most affected by sea-level rise, a deterrent for risk-averse corporations.Those issues haven’t stopped a boom in the parts of the economy most affected by the wealthy. “We’re seeing a level of interest the likes of which in my 20-plus years here I’ve never seen before,” says Ken Himmel, CEO of real estate developer Related Urban. More than 70% of Related’s new 360 Rosemary building in West Palm Beach is leased. The firm is constructing another office tower there and buying Phillips Point, home to offices for Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs and popular for its convenience to Palm Beach’s barrier island mansions.Ken Gorin, CEO of luxury-car purveyor the Collection, says his Miami-area dealerships notched their best month ever in December. He attributes about 10% of the sales to migration. Just recently, he recalls, a finance-industry transplant had come in for a Porsche Macan for his daughter. By the time the transaction was over, the customer had also made off with an Aston Martin sport utility vehicle for his wife and a McLaren 720S Spider for himself. “This is now people moving from California, people moving from New York—and it’s new,” he says. “It’s very exciting. And sales are way up.”Private schools are sensing a shift, too. At Pine Crest, an elite school with campuses in Boca Raton and Fort Lauderdale, interest has increased notably since March, due in part to the pandemic, remote-work arrangements, “and the attractive cost of living and quality of life in South Florida,” says Christine Dardet, a spokeswoman. A 2019 analysis by Webster Pacific showed tuition at top schools in the New York metro area averages $54,000, vs. $39,000 in the Miami metro.Among locals, there’s also wariness. Couper of Wealthspire laments the possibility of transplants driving up house prices and increasing traffic. Lorenzo Canizares, a 73-year-old retired labor organizer in West Kendall, is concerned about more serious consequences: the prospect that wealthy financiers will take advantage of the state’s tax structure to the detriment of long-term residents. “When people like that arrive here, everything seems to go up, and it makes it very difficult for people here,” says Canizares.For all the excitement, it’s unclear whether small outposts for financial companies will spur a dramatic transformation. Goldman Sachs is looking for at least 50,000 square feet of office space, according to the Palm Beach Post, a fraction of the 2.1 million square feet at its headquarters on Lower Manhattan’s West Street. Related’s Himmel says that finance moves would be a big deal for a relatively small office market such as West Palm Beach, but will do very little to cut into New York’s dominance in the industry, which is sustained by its unrivaled concentration of talent.There’s also the question of whether multitudes of finance workers are willing to uproot their lives. Throughout recent history, U.S. millionaires have been less likely to move than the general public, and many ultra-wealthy people remain based in the region where they built their business, according to The Myth of Millionaire Tax Flight: How Place Still Matters for the Rich, a 2017 book by Cornell University sociologist Cristobal Young. Many careers are built upon social networks in a place, and few mid-career professionals are willing to give up their home-field advantage, he wrote.Other people may fall somewhere in the middle. Jason Ader, CEO of SpringOwl Asset Management, relocated to Miami from New York with his wife and daughter in October, lured by the tax advantage, a business-friendly environment, and a more open economy during the pandemic. He still plans to keep a foot planted in the Northeast, where four of his children live with his ex-wife and his business is based. “I don’t know how I’m going to feel when I’m missing out on meetings and business lunches,” says Ader, 52. “Of course, none of that is even happening right now.”South Florida saw some of its most astounding growth in the immediate aftermath of the 1918 flu pandemic, according to Paul George, the resident historian at HistoryMiami Museum. The population of the City of Miami roughly quintupled to about 150,000 in the half decade through 1925, aided by post-World War I relief, he says, setting in motion the state’s long—albeit volatile—path to 2021. “We turned around after that pandemic was over and began to really look ahead, and this place boomed,” George says. “It was like we were being discovered for the first time in a mass way in South Florida.” —With Lananh Nguyen, Sridhar Natarajan, and Alex Tanzi.\\n \\nRead next: Tech Companies Cut Pay of Workers Moving Out of Big Cities'),\n",

       "  '2020-12-22',\n",
       "  'Broadcasting plays on the internet may increase audiences’ appetite for seeing shows in person.If theatergoers have learned one thing this year, it’s that watching live productions online isn’t a substitute for seeing the performances in person. That’s also why theaters shouldn’t see streaming as a threat. It’s an opportunity.Stage writers and directors have been wary of broadcasting their productions. There are the artistic considerations: The show was developed with a theatrical audience in mind, so watching it on a 32-inch screen compromises the experience. And there are other worries: that audiences won’t buy $90 tickets if they’ve already seen it on the box and that subsequent rights for a TV or film adaptation might become harder to sell.This year audience-deprived playhouses have had to find creative ways to plug the revenue gap. Many have looked online, either broadcasting shows they’ve already recorded or adapting them specifically for a web audience.London has been at the forefront. Two weeks after the National Theatre shut down in March, it started broadcasting a play a week for free on YouTube. It had a head start, of course: As part of its public-service remit, the National already records and broadcasts productions to cinemas, so it used that library. The 16 shows it posted on YouTube for a week at a time—including the Tony Award-winning One Man, Two Guvnors with James Corden, Frankenstein with Benedict Cumberbatch, and A Streetcar Named Desire with Gillian Anderson—attracted 15 million views, more than Broadway’s cumulative attendance in the 12 months through May 2019.In other words, the National was luring new audiences. The Old Vic theater had a similar experience. Its livestreaming of Lungs, with Claire Foy and Matt Smith, attracted 25,000 paying viewers in 69 countries during a week of performances.Research shows the phenomenon isn’t just a product of lockdowns. A 2016 U.K. study found that viewing live-to-digital performances didn’t reduce the frequency with which audiences attended live cultural performances. Among theatergoers, people who watched streamed performances went to the theater more than those who didn’t.There are hurdles. It can cost several hundred thousand dollars to shoot a play well. But it looks like a cost worth bearing given the seemingly insatiable appetite for online content. Hamilton led to a huge spike in sign-ups for Disney+, even if many customers didn’t retain the subscription. “Producers have become more sophisticated in their approach and better understand the models, that a screen version can drive the appetite,” says Neil Adleman, a lawyer who specializes in theater work at Harbottle & Lewis in London.The National Theatre has launched its own paid subscription streaming offering. It’s a way of reaching audiences who might not otherwise get to attend, while also serving as a tidy little earner. Broadway should take heed.\\n \\nWebb is the European technology columnist for Bloomberg Opinion.\\n \\nRead next: Hollywood’s Streaming Boom Is No Bonanza for Film Workers'),\n",

       "  '2020-12-18',\n",
       "  'There were some bright spots in the midst of a devastating year for dining out.Here’s to more great outdoor dining in 2021.iIlusrtration: Klaus KremmerzThere’s no way to sugarcoat the impact of the pandemic virus on the restaurant industry.In a Dec. 7 report, the National Restaurant Association said the industry was in “free fall,” with more than 110,000 restaurants closing since the start of Covid-19. Food-service revenue plunged an estimated $240 billion by the end of the year and restaurant staffing jobs fell 2 million below pre-pandemic levels, the NRA said.But in desperate situations there are often silver linings. Chefs, restaurateurs, bartenders, and sommeliers across the country have shown the kind of creativity you might get if you mashed up Walt Disney with Steve Jobs. They’ve been tireless in rethinking the way restaurants can work from dynamic outdoor dining situations to take-away dinners and touchless service. They’re the changes that have made a bad situation better, creating alternative revenue streams for owners and providing new ways for customers to experience their favorite places.In New York City, where the city streets act as resident’s front yards, restaurants are the de facto dining rooms and heart and soul of the landscape. After outdoor dining reopened in June, and open street plans were expanded, New Yorkers started partying outside as never before.The vibrant outdoor dining structures lit up the streets, like the colorful, flag-strewn setup at Lolo’s Seafood Shack in Harlem and the tropical-themed expanse at Kokomo in Williamsburg. Besides helping bring the city streets back to life, they created transportive alfresco experiences for diners: Marea’s elegant blue hydrangea-festooned patio in Midtown evoked an under-the-sea vibe. These structures weren’t cheap; Andrew Carmellini spent around $50,000 on each of the handsome ones outside the Manhattan restaurants he co-owns, like The Dutch, so he can use them again in the future. Mayor Bill de Blasio has announced that outdoor dining will continue in 2021.Because customers have been constrained in going to restaurants, chefs have brought the restaurant experience to them. They’ve created nifty meal kits and to-go packages, and teamed up with bartenders and liquor companies to make first-class to-go cocktails. That’s a practice that will continue to thrive at places like Fort Defiance General Store, which has grown out of the beloved Fort Defiance Bar in Red Hook, Brooklyn. Stone Barns, in Tarrytown and Manhattan, created highly in-demand meal kits, including a multi-course dinner party box featuring vegetables from the farm; owner Dan Barber says he will keep that practice going.At San Francisco’s three-Michelin-star Atelier Crenn, meal kits, such as one featuring a caviar tart, are accompanied by instructional videos from the staff. In Chicago, the Publican is now offering its popular marinated chicken, along with brown butter chocolate chip cookie dough, as a meal for four. And in L.A., Jon & Vinny’s has turned its beloved pizza into a make-it-at-home kit. It’s become such a popular category that Goldbelly has a dedicated section, with options from Gramercy Tavern burgers to pork buns and Peking duck from Jing Fong in New York’s Chinatown.The transition from paper menus to ones accessed via QR codes is terrific. It’s more sanitary and environmentally friendly, and you don’t have to wait for the grand presentation of a menu. The touchless version has also made for enterprising innovations, such as the one at this fall’s pop-up spot Parcelle Patio in New York City. The wine list included a live-chat feature, so guests could ask a sommelier for a suggestion and they would text you back with recommended bottles.A post shared by F O R K (@forkrestaurant)Out of necessity, chefs have gravitated toward shorter, better-curated menus. As the razor-thin margins of the restaurant industry have been exposed, along with supply chain issues, it’s a very easy way to cut food costs and waste. In Philadelphia, the dinner menu at Fork went from 20 core dishes to seven. Owner Ellen Yin describes it as a “lean mean machine” and says the change has cut food costs by 10%. A new fundraising dinner subscription service in New York City, Summerlong Supper Club, features three-course tasting menus from 16 popular restaurants including Atomix and Llama Inn; to maximize efficiencies for the restaurants, there are no substitutions or customizations. In Chicago, Pizza Friendly Pizza was created as a pared-down concept because of the pandemic: It’s just six pies and two sandwiches, from star chef Noah Sandoval. It makes the restaurant’s focus cleaner, too, even if you will miss the chef’s experimenting for the time being.A post shared by Joe’s Stone Crab (@joesstonecrab)Some formerly no-reservations spots are now taking reservations out of safety, crowding concerns, and also to confirm nightly seatings. Even famed no-reservations spots like Joe’s Stone Crab in Miami Beach now use reservation systems to fill seats. It doesn’t guarantee you a table–you still need advance planning and good luck to get into the perennially packed Via Carota in Manhattan, even though it’s nominally on Resy–but it has helped.And here’s to one of the biggest positive changes that came through in 2020: the emphasis toward equality. There’s been increased visibility for Black-owned businesses, through platforms like Spicy Green Book, the website and app that highlights them with professional images. And restaurants like Vinateria in Harlem saw an increase in traffic as a result of the Black Lives Matter messaging. Greg Baxtrom, who operates Olmsted in Brooklyn, turned his Maison Yaki space into a pop-up restaurant for a series of Black chefs through the second half of 2020 and says he will be doing it again in 2021. And let’s not forget all the restaurants that turned into de facto community kitchens, feeding rescue workers and then underserved neighborhoods, thanks to nonprofits like World Central Kitchen and Rethink. Daniel Humm at Eleven Madison Park, one of the most high-profile restaurants to adopt the model, has said he will continue providing meals to food-insecure people, even when his restaurant reopens.'),\n",

       "  '2020-12-08',\n",
       "  'Julia Child launched The French Chef on TV at 50, a year after publishing Mastering the Art of French Cooking. Ray Kroc began franchising McDonald’s at 52. Estelle Getty landed her breakout role on Broadway at age 58, then in her 60s racked up seven back-to-back Emmy nominations for The Golden Girls. These are all clearly exceptional third acts, but even if you aim for something more modest, you’re likelier to get there if you understand how the psychological formula for achievement shifts as you age.Psychologists have long known that success is fueled by grit, passion, and a growth mindset—a deep-seated conviction that you can excel at a new pursuit. Norwegian psychologist Hermundur Sigmundsson says that passion is by far the most important psychological factor—but it peaks early, which you may have seen in kids’ obsessions: the Dinosaur Phase. The Truck Phase. The Minecraft Phase. To a lesser extent, the same is true of the growth mindset, so by the time most of us reach the Build a Company Phase, two of the three most important ingredients in the recipe for achievement are waning. “You lose the thinking that maybe you can do this,” Sigmundsson says.But grit—a combination of perseverance and determination—rises through middle age and peaks in your 70s, as do a number of other helpful intellectual traits. Harvard and MIT researchers who tracked the cognitive skills of 48,000 people over time found that while mental processing speed is already on the downswing by the time you depart college, your ability to perceive the emotional state of other people and your vocabulary, comprehension, and aptitude for math keep climbing until at least 50. Though short-term memory declines after age 35, the mind’s accumulation of facts and knowledge peaks around retirement age. In many ways, that’s when your mind is best suited to dominate on the job.You’ll still need to overcome your flagging passion and growth mindset. A surplus of grit can help, says Anne Boden, 60, founder and chief executive officer of Starling Bank, a consumer-focused online financial house. When founding a company, “you spend most of your time convincing people to believe in you and give you money,” she says. “It’s a very weak position, and very humbling.”Boden had never lacked for ambition, holding roles at various financial companies and ultimately serving as chief operating officer of Allied Irish Banks Plc, Ireland’s biggest lender. Along the way, she frequently felt banks don’t really put customers front and center. So as she passed the five-decade mark, she decided she should do it herself. “The first time I uttered the words ‘I’m going to start a bank,’ I couldn’t believe they came out of my mouth,” she says. But by saying it over and over, she grew more comfortable with the idea. Soon, she says, “I felt like a woman who was going to start a bank.”Such an overabundance of determination may be unusual, but gritty, later-life professional success is not. Joy Behar taught English to high schoolers and worked as an ABC receptionist and producer before landing her seat on The View in 1997, at age 54. She continues to co-host at 78. Sigmundsson rattles off examples of colleagues such as a retired professor who started speed skating at 67 and is now a masters world champion at age 85. And Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, 86, the psychologist who discovered the immersed mental state known as “flow,” is still publishing. “It’s possible,” Sigmundsson says, “to keep the fire burning.”1. Make It Meaningful\\nOnce you pass the half-century mark, avoid work you don’t find compelling. The pandemic provides the perfect occasion to ditch—or be fired from—a position that doesn’t do much beyond keeping the lights on and the fridge full. “When you lose that just-OK job, you have the opportunity to take a big risk,” says Boden. “Take all the good from your past ventures and throw them into the future.”\\n \\n2. Move Your Body\\n“Physical activity is very important to keep the gray and white matter in your brain more functional,” says Sigmundsson. His studies show that successful older people are all physically active, including everyone mentioned in this article. Anything that gets your heart pumping, such as walking, swimming, yoga, biking, or weights, will do the trick.\\n \\n3. Fight Weakness\\nWhich is lowest: your grit, passion, or growth mindset? Help nurture your weakest trait by surrounding yourself with people and deadlines that bolster it. If your entrepreneurial passion is fading, find an enthusiastic business partner and join an incubator program. If you fear you won’t be able to write that novel you keep seeing in your dreams, join a weekly writing group and hire a book coach.\\n \\n4. Beyond Work\\nBonus points for learning completely new skills, which can improve cognitive function. The more novel and mentally demanding, the better—try, say, learning a new language or musical instrument. After a lifetime of playing percussion, Sigmundsson picked up the bass guitar at age 50. “My band needed a bass player,” he says. “Now I’m 55, and I’m quite good.”'),\n",

The streaming wars, the thinking went, would distract or siphon off Netflix customers. But by the time the coronavirus pandemic hit, Netflix had stockpiled a mountain of binge-worthy content for people stuck at home with no theaters to go to and little new programming from traditional networks. And because part of co-Chief Executive Officer Hastings’s strategy is to release new TV seasons all at once—not to mention that Netflix spends more than $17 billion annually on programming—it overwhelmed its competitors with variety and volume.At a time when challengers couldn’t produce new entertainment, the streaming service released popular docuseries (Tiger King), reality shows (Love Is Blind), movies (The Old Guard), and foreign-language programs (Dark), making it seem as if current events hadn’t affected the company at all. Although record unemployment has forced people to rethink their spending, they’ve been more inclined to cut the cord than to stop paying for Netflix, which will surpass 200 million customers by yearend.

       "  'ILLUSTRATION: NICHOLE SHINN FOR BLOOMBERG BUSINESSWEEKJeffrey Katzenberg and Meg Whitman are phenomenally successful businesspeople with precisely the wrong instincts for a streaming service.The view from Meg Whitman’s wraparound private terrace was dazzling. In 2018, three months after she stepped down as chief executive officer of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co., Whitman moved to Los Angeles, into a sprawling, $6.5 million condo on the 24th floor of West Hollywood’s Sierra Towers. The apartment had only two bedrooms but offered lots of other indulgences—floor-to-ceiling skyline views, a home theater, a quarry’s worth of kitchen marble—as well as a patina of Hollywood glamor. Whitman could say she lived in a building whose residents have included Sandra Bullock, Elton John, David Geffen, Evander Holyfield, and Cher. And there was still a chance of running into Adam Sandler in the lobby.Whitman, one of Silicon Valley’s most powerful women, had moved to L.A. to work with people like that. She’d been recruited a year earlier by Jeffrey Katzenberg, the Hollywood megaproducer who co-founded DreamWorks Animation, who was betting that the future of entertainment was short-form videos with old-school studio production values. Whitman was to be the CEO of a streaming service with episodic programming that aimed to wow a generation raised on YouTube.But the service, called Quibi, premiered this past spring to crickets and jeers. Over the summer, Whitman talked her team through a retooling plan and acted as though she planned to remain in L.A. for a good, long while. But in early August, less than two years after she bought the Sierra Towers condo, she put it back on the market.Her staffers noticed. Several circulated the real estate listing, spurring a wave of quiet searches for employment elsewhere. More than one marks that as the beginning of the end for Quibi. “When your CEO puts their L.A. home up for sale less than two years after buying it, that’s when you know the writing is on the wall,” says one former Quibi employee, who, like most of the 24 current and former staffers interviewed for this story, spoke on condition of anonymity to protect future job prospects.Toward the end of October, Quibi’s seventh month in the crowded streaming market, Whitman and Katzenberg assembled their employees on a video call to tell them the company would be shutting down around Dec. 1. A misty-eyed, apologetic Katzenberg encouraged employees to comfort themselves by playing the song Get Back Up Again from the DreamWorks movie Trolls.Quibi had long been mocked for its hodgepodge programming lineup and inscrutable name (short for “quick bites”). But insiders say its downfall can also be traced to the co-founders’ stubborn management, faulty instincts, difficulty promoting their products on social media, and initial smartphone-only approach, which proved ill-suited to people’s viewing habits during a pandemic. And the company did little to seek out the up-and-coming talent that has proven successful on YouTube, instead relying on classic Hollywood formulas served up by pricey established producers and stars, some of whom became its critics. “Quibi took everything that is Hollywood and nothing of what was truly a startup, with its top-down model, OG [old guard] deals, dick swinging, and star f---ing,” says Evan Shapiro, who’s produced or created more than 150 shows, including one for Quibi—Let’s Go, Atsuko!, adapted from a popular podcast. “Take the worst parts of Hollywood, bake it into a phone, and that’s what you got,” he says.Quibi declined to comment for this story, instead referring questions about the current and former employees’ criticisms to an open letter to employees, investors, and partners that Katzenberg and Whitman published last month. In the letter, the co-founders said Quibi’s failure likely resulted from one of two problems: “because the idea itself wasn’t strong enough to justify a standalone service or because of our timing.”Katzenberg, one of Hollywood’s biggest and most influential donors to the Democratic Party, made an odd pairing with Whitman, who once ran for California’s governorship as a Republican. Their sales pitch to viewers was similarly counterintuitive: shows of Netflix- or Hulu-level quality, broken into chunks of 10 minutes or less, to appeal to 25- to 35-year-olds on the go. Yet the duo’s reputations and confidence attracted more than $1.7 billion from investors including Disney, 21st Century Fox, NBCUniversal, Sony Pictures, Viacom, and Alibaba, many of which were developing their own streaming services. (Disclaimer: Bloomberg Businessweek’s parent, Bloomberg LP, recently debuted its own streaming-news service.) With that kind of money on hand, much of Katzenberg’s A-list network proved receptive, too. Over fancy meals around L.A., he won over the likes of director Antoine Fuqua and comedian Chris Rock. “If it can be on YouTube, it can’t be on Quibi,” he often said, according to people familiar with the matter.Several current and former Quibi employees say Katzenberg built himself a punishing schedule. In the weeks after Quibi went live, he’d rise by 3:30 each morning, work out while reading the news from 5 a.m. to 7 a.m., and conduct as many as 20 FaceTime meetings a day, turning most any interaction along the way into an impromptu meeting about the company. He divided show ideas into three categories: the titular “quick bites” (short, one-off videos), “daily essentials” (news programs), and “lighthouse” shows (projects involving A-listers).The latter ate up most of the budget. According to a Quibi pitch deck seen by Bloomberg Businessweek, lighthouse shows generally cost $20,000 to $125,000 a minute, compared with roughly $10,000 a minute for daily essentials. Fuqua’s series, #FreeRayshawn, which stars Laurence Fishburne and Stephan James, cost $15 million for 15 episodes of 10 minutes each, a competitive budget for today’s streaming services. Netflix Inc.’s Stranger Things costs $6 million to $8 million for episodes that typically run for 45 minutes to an hour, and Disney+ is expected to spend as much as $25 million an episode on Marvel shows such as Hawkeye and WandaVision. But in another respect, Quibi sweetened the deals far beyond what other streaming services were willing to offer. Two years in, creators would be free to edit their Quibi shows together into an extended work and sell the longer version somewhere else. After seven years the company’s rights to the short-form versions would expire.Katzenberg also applied his decades of development experience, something current and former employees say was part of the problem. The 69-year-old former wunderkind often insisted that he weigh in on everything from casting to wardrobe to graphic design, frequently via FaceTime with printouts of his notes next to him. He invested aggressively in somewhat out-there series with recognizable names attached, such as Most Dangerous Game, starring Liam Hemsworth and Christoph Waltz; Dummy, starring Anna Kendrick; and Thanks a Million, a giveaway reality show produced by Jennifer Lopez. To narrate voiceover for Fierce Queens, a wildlife program produced by BBC Studios, Quibi paid Reese Witherspoon $6 million. (Her husband, Jim Toth, was Quibi’s head of content acquisitions.)The overall results, in the view of some Quibi employees in the target demographic, were underwhelming. “I won’t necessarily care if there’s a ‘star’ in a show as long as it looks good and my friends recommend it,” one of them says. “YouTube is full of unknown names who get billions of views. Why wouldn’t we recruit a few of them and bring their established viewership to us?” Staffers say pitches centered on online “influencers” were sometimes shot down, then revived with Hollywood actors attached.Katzenberg bet on Whitman, who lacked startup experience, to legitimize Quibi as a tech startup. Whitman hired experienced lieutenants, luring Chief Technology Officer Rob Post away from Hulu and head of product Tricia Lee from Sony. She and Katzenberg also brokered a deal to bundle a year of Quibi with T-Mobile’s unlimited wireless plans. The Quibi app’s most impressive technical feature, called Turnstyle, switched footage of a show seamlessly between high-end vertical and horizontal versions of a given shot depending on how the users were holding their phones. The Quibi team achieved this the old-fashioned way, by making their creative teams frame every shot for both aspect ratios.But Whitman, too, had trouble dealing with Katzenberg, current and former employees say. One month in, four of them say, she threatened to quit because he wouldn’t stop interrupting her and micromanaging her staff. Their mutual solution, according to three people familiar with the matter, was to interact as rarely as possible.As Quibi prepared for its April 6 premiere, Whitman and Katzenberg agreed on at least one key point: The videos should be available only on smartphones, not TVs. Current and former employees say that in March, with Covid-19 spreading across the U.S., the co-founders met for several hours to debate delaying the rollout, but decided against it. Instead, they canceled a swanky launch party and extended the service’s free trial period from 14 days to 90.When Quibi debuted, its app was the third-most-downloaded free app in Apple Inc.’s App Store. (Once the free trials expired, users had to pay $4.99 to $7.99 a month to stream Quibi’s roughly 50 titles.) But within two weeks, Quibi dropped off the charts, and fewer than 100,000 users paid to subscribe once their trial periods ended, according to current and former employees. The lineup simply didn’t have a must-watch show, and the app initially wouldn’t let viewers take screenshots to post on social media, making it all the tougher to generate buzz.Investors say Quibi executives downplayed the scale of its problems. “The company painted a relatively positive picture to us that things are going well,” says Anis Uzzaman, general partner and founder of Pegasus Tech Ventures, which invested $35 million in Quibi. “They admitted [subscriber growth] was not as good as expected because of the coronavirus, but said it wasn’t bad and that growth was happening.”Weeks after Quibi’s disappointing premiere, Katzenberg and Whitman hired marketing consultants to rethink their strategy, according to three people familiar with the matter. Then, these people say, the co-founders ignored key recommendations, including to pick a show to heavily promote, like Netflix did back in 2013 with House of Cards. They did, however, make Quibi videos easier to share on social media and added AirPlay and Chromecast support to allow TV viewing over Wi-Fi. The product team struggled, though, to develop apps for Apple TV, Android TV, and Amazon Fire TV all at once.By September, Quibi’s user base had crept to about 400,000, putting it far behind the company’s internal projections of 7.4 million viewers by the end of 2020. That same month, Whitman and Katzenberg considered raising more money or selling the company. They pitched Apple Senior Vice President Eddy Cue, Facebook app chief Fidji Simo, WarnerMedia CEO Jason Kilar, and NBCUniversal, none of whom bit on either option, according to people familiar with the meetings. With $350 million left, the co-founders abruptly decided to shut down the service. “As entrepreneurs, our instinct is to always pivot, to leave no stone unturned—especially when there is some cash runway left—but we feel that we’ve exhausted all our options,” they wrote in their open letter to employees, investors, and partners. Ahead of the Dec. 1 shutdown, some Quibi staffers have decamped for employers like Netflix, Apple, and Sony Pictures Television.The shutdown decision blindsided creative teams whose shows Quibi had recently picked up or renewed for a second season. Hours before the co-founders’ announcement, series creator Mike Catherwood was emailing back and forth with a Quibi executive about Rudy, an animated series he was developing for the service about a former prison inmate starting a new life with his family. Catherwood’s team has already written two 10-minute scripts, and he’s stuck hoping he can find the show a new home. “I just know that I want to keep moving forward, and I want to make sure that this show finds the light of day somewhere else,” says Catherwood. Several former employees say Quibi will be working with legal and financial advisors over the next several months to sell its assets, including the rights to its shows.Whitman is an early contender for several cabinet-level positions in President-elect Joe Biden’s administration, according to three people familiar with the matter. Weeks after she put her L.A. condo up for sale, the former Republican gubernatorial candidate appeared during the Democratic National Convention to endorse Biden on national TV. “For me, the choice is simple,” Whitman said. “I’m with Joe.”It’s unclear what Katzenberg will do next, but the producer seems less likely to leave the entertainment industry behind. “One might wonder why sailing off into the sunset on a boat in the Caribbean isn’t an option for Jeffrey,” says Shapiro, the producer of Let’s Go, Atsuko! “But I don’t get the sense he’ll want this to be the last chapter of his storied career.”Update: Following publication of this story, Quibi spokesperson Gina Stikes disputed that Whitman and Katzenberg had difficulty working together, that executives downplayed problems to investors, and that consultants suggested focusing Quibi marketing on fewer shows. She also said Reese Witherspoon made less than $1 million for narrating Fierce Queens and stressed that Jim Toth wasn’t involved in the deal and that Whitman planned to return to L.A. once Quibi’s offices had reopened.

       "  'Plaintiffs’ lawyer John Houghtaling is leading the charge against insurance companies that say they don’t have to pay up for shutdowns.Houghtaling at his mansion in New Orleans.PHOTOGRAPHER: DAYMON GARDNER FOR BLOOMBERG BUSINESSWEEKJohn Houghtaling was working in the second-floor den of his mansion near the Garden District in New Orleans when a legal memo arrived in his email inbox. It was mid-March, not long before the pandemic shut down much of the U.S., and cooks in white aprons were downstairs preparing an extravagant dinner: lobster casserole, veal chops, seared foie gras. The celebrity chef Jérôme Bocuse, a close friend, would be attending that evening, along with two dozen other guests.Seated on a velvet couch beneath an 18th century painting of Louis XV, Houghtaling, a plaintiffs’ lawyer who’s long specialized in suing the insurance industry, scanned the memo on his screen, growing increasingly agitated. The 10-page document, compiled by a law firm that represents major insurance carriers, was circulating among industry insiders who were anticipating that local governments would soon begin shutting down commerce because of the novel coronavirus. The memo outlined a series of arguments the providers planned to make to avoid paying virus-related claims from business-interruption coverage—policies companies purchase to hedge against fires and other catastrophes.The chefs downstairs might soon lose their livelihoods, Houghtaling realized, and the insurance industry would refuse to help. His next thought was, he admits, a selfish one: “This party is gonna f---ing suck.”Sure enough, early in the evening, Chef Bocuse got a call: His two restaurants at Walt Disney World were being shut down. When he hung up, however, he was sanguine. “We checked the policy,” he assured Houghtaling. “We’re good.”Houghtaling was skeptical. “They’re not going to pay,” he said.“Yeah, yeah,” Bocuse replied. “You always say they’re not gonna pay.”The next few days passed in a series of frantic phone calls. Other celebrity chefs, including Daniel Boulud, another friend of Houghtaling’s, vowed to examine their policies and discuss the issue with colleagues. On March 16, less than a week after the dinner party, Houghtaling filed a petition in state court in Louisiana on behalf of the New Orleans restaurant Oceana Grill, asking a judge to declare preemptively that its insurance policy would cover damage caused by the virus.The suit represented the opening salvo in what has become the single biggest legal battle to emerge from the pandemic. Faced with the worst business interruption in living memory, the insurance giants have, by and large, refused to pay business-interruption claims. U.S. plaintiffs’ lawyers have filed more than 1,100 complaints against insurers, according to a tally by Tom Baker, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania.The stakes are enormous. Business owners from small restaurants to major retailers say they could go bankrupt unless they’re paid. Insurance companies say the payouts could cripple them—one industry estimate looking at just U.S. small businesses with fewer than 100 employees places the total monthly cost of reimbursing their pandemic losses at between $52 billion and $223 billion. The dispute is also playing out in Congress and state legislatures, where bills have been introduced requiring insurers to pay for pandemic-related losses.“The word ‘unprecedented’ is probably overused in this, but I don’t think I have another word for it,” says Henry Daar, an executive vice president who oversees property claims for insurance broker Willis Towers Watson. “There have been huge insurable events in the past, with billions of dollars at issue. All of those involved situations that affected a discrete area and a discrete number of companies. This pandemic has affected everybody.”Houghtaling has spearheaded the legal offensive from his mansion. Since March he’s challenged three major companies in court and formed a lobbying coalition called the Business Interruption Group, which is pressing lawmakers in Congress to pass a bill requiring insurers to pay certain virus-related claims. His Oceana Grill case is scheduled to go to trial on Nov. 16, in one of the first major tests of Covid insurance law.A bow-tie-wearing 49-year-old bon vivant with slicked-back hair, Houghtaling has a taste for luxury and a penchant for grandiosity. He often toggles between metaphors to describe his fights with the insurance industry, as if groping for an appropriately epic comparison. Sometimes he’s David, valiantly challenging Goliath. Other times he’s Batman, battling villains in Gotham City.The night of the party, he says, he felt more like a passenger on the Titanic. He sat next to Bocuse at a long mahogany table, a candlelit chandelier hanging overhead. There were towering flower arrangements and a cake shaped like a go-kart helmet in honor of Bocuse’s son, a professional racer. A band marched through the house, singing and dancing.Houghtaling could already tell it was the last party he’d host for a long time. “The whole thing is sinking,” he thought.About a decade before Covid-19 upended daily life, Doug and Gayle Mellin moved into a condominium in the small town of Epping, N.H. They soon encountered a problem: the pervasive stench of cat urine. The smell originated in a downstairs unit and rose through the plumbing system, drifting into the Mellins’ apartment from behind a set of kitchen cabinets. The couple sold the condo at a loss and went to court to force their insurer, Northern Security Insurance Co., to cover the difference, arguing that the odor constituted “direct physical loss to the property.”For years, insurance companies and policyholders have debated the meaning of the phrases “physical loss” and “physical damage,” the standard formulations governing which types of harm are covered. In 2015 the Supreme Court of New Hampshire found that the Mellins’ property had suffered physical loss, ruling that such harm can exist even “in the absence of structural damage.” But in other states, courts have adopted much narrower interpretations, arguing that “intangible harms” like a stench don’t amount to physical contaminants.Arcane contractual disputes such as this could now determine the survival of thousands of American businesses. If courts rule that the presence of a virus inside a building entails physical loss or damage, then business-interruption policyholders might have valid insurance claims. In the memo Houghtaling received in March, Shannon O’Malley, a lawyer for the law firm Zelle, predicted that “creative policyholders and their attorneys may try to link the virus and physical property damage.” She argued that because the virus “may be cleaned without essentially altering the property is evidence that there is no initial damage.”In the Oceana Grill case, Houghtaling did exactly as O’Malley had envisioned, casting the coronavirus as a physical threat—a web of microscopic particles that comes to rest on surfaces, rendering property unusable. And anticipating the industry’s legal strategy, he and other advocates successfully lobbied public officials in New York City and elsewhere to include phrases such as “physical loss” and “physical damage” in shutdown orders requiring businesses to close.To Houghtaling, there’s no question the industry’s position is self-serving. “If you ask them, ‘Is contamination physical?’ they start getting into arcane things like cat piss,” he says. “Do you need to? Something that is small, that can go through the air and contaminate and get into your nose and get you very sick or kill your mother and father\\u2009…\\u2009it’s physical.”Since March scores of lawyers have made similar arguments, demanding payouts for restaurants, studios, tattoo parlors, salons, casinos, theaters, retailers, and sports franchises. But not all business-interruption policies are the same, and many of the lawsuits face considerable obstacles. John Ellison, an insurance litigator who represents policyholders, estimates that from half to two-thirds of business-interruption policies contain “virus exclusions”—contract language stipulating that losses caused by viruses aren’t covered. On their face, the exclusions appear to rule out insurance payments for businesses that close because of a pandemic. But in a lawsuit filed in California, Ellison is arguing that such exclusions should be unenforceable.This type of language dates to the SARS outbreak in the early 2000s, when some insurers were forced to make expensive payouts to businesses in Asia that closed, such as the $16 million paid to the Mandarin Oriental hotel chain. Afterward, representatives for the insurance industry got permission from state regulators to add policy language explicitly excluding viruses and other “disease-causing agents” from insurance plans. They assured the regulators that the new language would not limit the scope of coverage but merely clarify its original intent.Ellison calls that request deliberately misleading—a ruse to trick regulators into approving downgraded insurance plans without requiring providers to lower prices accordingly. “You didn’t reduce the premium, you didn’t provide the coverage that you should have, by virtue of the misrepresentation,” he says. “So we’re asking one court already, and we’re going to be asking other courts, to not allow the insurers to rely on exclusions that they obtained through a misrepresentation.”The industry has responded aggressively to Ellison and other litigators, hiring expensive law firms and deploying its lobbyists to urge state legislators to abandon efforts to force payouts. The Insurance Information Institute, a trade group, introduced a website arguing that it would violate contract law to force insurers to pay pandemic claims. “The plaintiffs’ bar is always looking to expand coverage beyond what’s covered in the policy language,” says David Sampson, chief executive officer of the American Property Casualty Insurance Association, another trade group.In April, Evan Greenberg, CEO of Chubb Ltd., one of the world’s largest insurers, published an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal arguing that lawsuits “won’t cure corona.” Houghtaling was outraged. “He called us beggars,” he says, his voice rising. “That was too much for us.”Greenberg, who declined to comment, had actually written something much milder—that the litigation would repeat the “beggar-thy-neighbor mistakes of the Great Depression.” Still, in pursuit of vengeance, Houghtaling strategized with the Simon Wiesenthal Center, a Holocaust research and advocacy organization with an insurance policy from Chubb. The group’s mission has a personal connection for Greenberg, whose father, former American International Group Chairman Maurice Greenberg, helped liberate the Dachau concentration camp during World War II.On behalf of the center, Houghtaling sued Chubb in federal court in California on April 29, the 75th anniversary of Dachau’s liberation. “We found it very ironic,” he says. “That was really a message we wanted to send to Evan Greenberg personally.”While attending law school at Loyola University New Orleans, Houghtaling worked as an assistant at Gauthier & Murphy, the local firm that spearheaded the tobacco litigation of the 1990s. One of the partners, Bob Murphy, remembers asking Houghtaling to spruce up a 55-gallon chemical drum Murphy planned to present at trial. It was menial work, but Houghtaling managed to inject it with glamour. Leaving the office one evening, Murphy ran into Houghtaling in the parking lot, where he was spray-painting the drum, his suit jacket draped over the door of a bright red Mercedes. “He definitely got my attention,” Murphy says.Houghtaling ultimately became one of the most successful trial lawyers at the firm, raking in tens of millions of dollars from wrongful death and personal injury cases. He represented a police officer disfigured by a fireworks explosion on New Year’s Eve and handled the litigation stemming from a deadly boat accident on the Mississippi River. By 2005, Houghtaling was wealthy enough that he was able to purchase Gauthier & Murphy outright.He didn’t start to focus on property-damage lawsuits until Hurricane Katrina, six months after he bought the firm. In the wake of the storm, he worked with Louisiana’s attorney general to represent policyholders who were being undercut by the insurance industry. Houghtaling played a similar role after Superstorm Sandy ripped into New York and New Jersey in 2012, uncovering evidence of forged storm-damage reports that the carriers were using to lowball homeowners. The storm cases turned him into one of the country’s most prominent property-damage litigators.Houghtaling has since parlayed his national profile into other business pursuits. Six years ago he started an oil and gas company called American Ethane, investing in an industry he’d explored as a possible litigation target during the cleanup of the BP Plc oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. In 2017, American Ethane secured a multibillion-dollar contract to export liquid ethane to China, finalized in a signing ceremony attended by President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. Houghtaling says he started the company partly because he wanted to become a billionaire—a goal he has yet to reach. When a group of his business partners flew into New Orleans on an extravagant Gulfstream G650, he worried that his own private jet would seem shabby in comparison: “I called my pilot, and I said, ‘You want to help them land, but don’t point out my jet, because it’ll be embarrassing,’\\u200a” he says.In 2010 he bought the nine-bedroom, 22,000-square-foot mansion on St. Charles Avenue, which is furnished with paintings, tapestries, and a bed once owned by Marie Antoinette. He was single when he moved in, but in 2012 he married the Russian model and pop star Yulia Timonina, with whom he now has two children.Houghtaling has also amassed a collection of luxury cars. For years he’d saved a dog-eared Lamborghini catalog he enjoyed reading as a child, and in the mid-2000s he decided to buy one of the models. Then he bought a second. “I kept making more money,” he recalls. “And I said, ‘OK, I’ll buy another one.’ Another one. Another one. And then I thought, ‘OK, I’ll buy every Lamborghini in that book.’\\u200a” That was 17 Lamborghinis.Nevertheless, Houghtaling is sensitive about being seen as the stereotypical plaintiffs’ lawyer, who exploits catastrophe to finance a lavish lifestyle. His role in the Covid litigation isn’t primarily about money, he says. He’s fronting more than $1 million a month for the legal battle and the associated lobbying campaign. Because he’s paid on contingency, he’ll make money only if he wins in court. It’s worth the risk, Houghtaling says, because the fight feels personal. Some of his closest friends are chefs who’ve had to shut down their restaurants. And he’s always appalled when insurers refuse to pay claims for disasters. After Sandy, he says, lawyers for the industry “personally had a hand in destroying people’s lives.”Since 2018, Houghtaling has appeared at a series of trade shows sponsored by the contracting industry, debating Steven Badger, a partner at Zelle who’s represented insurance companies since the early 1990s. Over the years, Badger’s ferocious advocacy has earned him the nickname Darth Vader, and he leans into the moniker. At the trade shows, costumed Stormtroopers sometimes escort him around, and he keeps a Vader helmet on a shelf in his law office—a gift from Houghtaling, who owns a collection of vintage Star Wars memorabilia.Their debates tend to follow a pattern. As the crowd cheers him on, Houghtaling grows increasingly theatrical, prowling the stage or bellowing into his microphone. He compares elements of property-insurance law to the gravest injustices in human history, from the slave trade to the Holocaust. “I let him rant and rave,” Badger says. “I’ll jump in when I have a point to make.” Before the pandemic, Houghtaling held tutorials for lawyers and contractors, teaching them how to avoid what he terms “Badger traps”—clever maneuvers Badger and other industry lawyers use to win cases. But the pair have also become friends, and these days they speak sometimes multiple times a week, discussing the business-interruption dispute.The litigation has been a boon for Zelle. In the early weeks of the pandemic, Houghtaling spread the word to reporters and government officials about the memo describing the insurance industry’s plans to fight business-interruption claims. “It was great marketing for us,” Badger says. “People called us up wanting the paper.” In the spring and summer, the firm went on a hiring spree, adding eight attorneys to its 75-person legal staff.Houghtaling says he’s unhappy about the thousand-plus surge of cases. Many of them, in his view, make flimsy arguments centered on policies with virus exclusions, giving the industry a chance to notch wins that could influence judges in future cases or discourage policyholders from filing claims. When he sees a flawed suit, he calls the lawyers who filed it, urging them to reconsider. This rarely goes well. “Some of them are making arguments that are completely stupid,” Houghtaling says. “I don’t have control, as much as I’ve tried to.”Over the summer, a group of plaintiffs’ attorneys, including some from well-established firms, sought to consolidate hundreds of the suits in one federal court. The tactic is often used by plaintiffs’ lawyers, with the aim of limiting costs and pressuring defendants. Unsurprisingly, the industry fought the consolidation. But it had some strange bedfellows: Houghtaling and other veteran coverage litigators, some of whom argued in court that variations in how business-interruption policies are written made it unfeasible to consolidate so many disparate cases.“It was very weird,” says Amy Bach, executive director of United Policyholders, an advocacy group that usually battles insurers. “We were on the same side as the insurance companies. We’re surgeons on my team. We knew that there’s no way it’s going to benefit policyholders to have everything consolidated.” A panel of judges rejected the consolidation effort, though they ultimately approved a much narrower grouping of some of the lawsuits.Houghtaling says litigation is only one piece of his broader strategy. He even withdrew the suit against Chubb (which had filed a motion to dismiss) after the Simon Wiesenthal Center decided to wait and see whether the company would make a payment. In recent months, he’s been trying to persuade Badger to work with him on a compromise—what he calls “my grand scheme.” He’d like the insurance industry to support legislation proposed by U.S. Representative Mike Thompson, a Democrat from California, calling for the federal government to reimburse insurers for business-interruption payouts. “I want to convince Steve that HR7412 is good for him and his clients—and good for everybody,” Houghtaling says.Passing such legislation would be an uphill battle under a Congress that hasn’t even been able to agree on a new pandemic relief package. In any case, Badger isn’t interested in the compromise. “I applaud John’s efforts to try to look for some broader solution, but that solution cannot involve the insurance industry agreeing to pay clients that are not otherwise covered,” he says. “Every plaintiffs’ lawyer works on a contingency fee, so if there is a program where the insurance industry is paying claims that are not covered and they’re getting reimbursed, there’s no doubt a percentage of that would go to plaintiffs’ lawyers. Is that good policy?”Houghtaling suspects the industry’s reluctance to compromise stems from its early success in some of the litigation. Over the past few months, federal judges in California, Texas, and several other states have dismissed business-interruption lawsuits, albeit mostly ones involving virus-exclusion clauses. He’s ebullient, though, about one recent success: In August a federal judge in Missouri rejected an effort by Cincinnati Insurance Co. to dismiss a business-interruption case, ruling that a group of plaintiffs led by the Studio 417 hair salon in Springfield had “adequately stated a claim for direct physical loss.” When he saw the ruling, Houghtaling texted Badger the iconic “Show me the money” clip from Jerry Maguire.Badger and Houghtaling agree that it will be a few more months before it’s truly clear which side has the upper hand, as more judges reach decisions in the first wave of cases. “If the insurance industry wins most of them, I think that’ll take the wind out of the sails of the plaintiffs’ lawyers, and it’ll probably go away fairly quickly,” Badger says. “If the plaintiffs’ lawyers start to get traction with victories, it could drag on for years.”A yearslong legal battle might not be much help to struggling businesses. In September, the New York retail chain Century 21 Stores filed for bankruptcy, citing its insurance provider’s refusal to pay $175 million in business-interruption claims. And almost 20,000 restaurants have already closed permanently because of the pandemic, according to data compiled by Yelp. “It saddens me to death,” says Thomas Keller, a renowned chef in California who’s sued his insurer over business-interruption coverage. “It’s an enormous amount of employees in businesses in dire need of some type of protection.”The pandemic has also taken a toll on some major insurance companies. Chubb, for example, reported $1.2 billion in second-quarter losses stemming from the crisis. Others are faring better. Travelers Cos. said in October that its pandemic-related losses were being offset by favorable trends linked to lockdowns, as people stayed at home and got into fewer car accidents. And Cincinnati Financial Corp., the parent company of Cincinnati Insurance, announced profits of $484 million for the third quarter, almost double what it earned over the same period last year.For all his personal wealth, Houghtaling considers himself the underdog in this fight. “If I hit them 1%—enough to buy a fleet of Ferraris and a private jet and houses all over and a humongous mansion with tens of millions in antiques in it—they don’t care. It’s a drop in the bucket,” he says. “I’m a nobody. I’m not a microscopic something on a gnat. I’m nothing.” —With Katherine Chiglinsky '),\n",

       "  'BTS stans built the trolling blueprint for 4chan types, and they’ve proven they can disrupt it.Even by the standards of U.S. politics in the accursed year 2020, the wall of thrusting digital crotches was weird. One day in June, barely a week after a Minneapolis police officer murdered George Floyd and ignited nationwide protests, people started tweeting #WhiteLivesMatter so frequently that it became one of Twitter’s most popular hashtags worldwide. The white supremacist phrase is a call to arms within QAnon, the militant sect that believes God sent President Trump to defeat a shadowy cabal of pedophiles and child traffickers. But the tweets weren’t what they seemed. Anyone who clicked the hashtag or typed it into Twitter’s search bar looking for fellow racists instead found a rolling stream of video clips featuring Korean boy bands, their pelvises gyrating below their smoldering eyes and perfect pastel hair.More than 22,000 tweets bearing Korean pop stars flooded hashtags like #WhiteLivesMatter and #QAnon that evening, according to market researcher Zignal Labs. Some typical accompanying text: “Stan twitter RISE.” The barrage effectively commandeered the hashtag and rendered it all but unusable to white supremacists. QAnon devotees are familiar with this tactic, known as keyword squatting, because they use it all the time. “They got beaten at their own game by Korean pop fans,” says Mike Rothschild, a conspiracy theory researcher who’s writing a book about QAnon. “I’d never seen anything like it before.”K-pop stans have. Stan culture takes its name from the titular character in an old Eminem song about a psychotically obsessed fan. Often, stanning means pumping up YouTube view counts on new music videos or voting for a band in numbers high enough to crash whichever website is soliciting votes for an award. Other times, it can cross the line into group harassment of a preferred celeb’s perceived enemies.When that happens, it can feel to targets like they’re being trolled by QAnon—ask anyone who’s crossed the Beyhive or the Swifties and lived to post about it. K-pop stans, in the years they’ve spent organizing online, have been known to swarm critics who’ve described their favorite genre’s deep debts to Black music as cultural appropriation. They’ve also relentlessly bullied anyone who’s criticized or made lewd comments about their idols online. More conventionally, they’ve overwhelmed the phone lines at hundreds of U.S. radio stations by calling en masse to demand airplay for the latest single by Blackpink or Monsta X.In the past few months, Trump supporters have started to understand how those radio producers feel. K-pop stans have regularly hijacked QAnon and MAGA social media hashtags. They’ve led get-out-the-vote efforts against the president. And many were among the online pranksters who boasted about helping derail a Trump rally in Tulsa where he’d said 1 million people planned to show up, and barely 6,000 did. It’s tough to know how many of the 13,000 unused seats were meant for stans who’d asked for tickets with no intention of going, but the emptyish stadium infuriated Trump and came to be seen as a turning point in the presidential campaign. While K-pop stans probably won’t swing the election, their trolling is enough of a cultural force that political consultants have taken notice.The stan activism has been dominated by fans of BTS, the kings of K-pop. The seven-member boy band, also known as Bangtan Sonyeondan (“Bulletproof Boy Scouts”), can cut slightly ridiculous figures with their double denims, platform sneakers, and cotton-candy pink hair. But they’re the first group since the Beatles to release three Billboard-chart-topping albums in a year, and they’re also the most tweeted-about band on Earth. Before Covid-19 hit, BTS was selling out U.S. stadiums faster than Taylor Swift. Big Hit Entertainment Co., the group’s management company, made $820 million in an initial public offering on Oct. 14 and is now valued at more than $4 billion. BTS fans call themselves ARMY, which stands for Adorable Representative M.C. for Youth. (Clearly, they really wanted to spell ARMY.)Big Hit markets its straightedge Disney princes extremely carefully. Like most K-pop acts, the members of BTS find their lifestyles and freedom of expression tightly policed—no significant others, no tattoos, no divisive thoughts on politics. (Although BTS members have managed to bend some of these rules at times, the company also declined to make the band available for comment for this story.) So it was a big deal when, in June, BTS tweeted a brief statement of support for the Black Lives Matter movement to its 26 million followers and announced that it had donated $1 million to the cause. “We stand against racial discrimination,” the band said. “We condemn violence. You, I and we all have the right to be respected. We will stand together. #BlackLivesMatter.”To some extent, the band was following the lead of its fans, many of whom were already demanding that ARMY take a stand. Millions of BTS fans live in the U.S. and identify as people of color, according to researchers and surveys of popular fan accounts. Many are over the age of 30, repping Twitter handles like @KpopDad and @MomsNoonas (bio: “Never ever, ever too old to fan-girl”). But ARMY has its share of young people, too. Some professors attribute a recent spike in American college students studying Korean to K-pop fans who want to understand the lyrics of their favorite songs.Daezy Agbakoba, a recent graduate of London’s Middlesex University who’s now back home in Maryland, has a K-pop conversion story that would sound familiar to a 4chan kid radicalized into QAnon. Four years ago, she stumbled onto her first BTS video while watching YouTube. Now, untold hours of algorithmic recommendations later, she’s studying Korean by day and binge-watching the band’s videos at night, her ARMY light stick—a vastly upgraded version of waving a phone flashlight during a concert—resting nearby. “When you get into them, it’s just this steep descent,” she says. “Kind of like how Alice falls down the rabbit hole.”This spring, Agbakoba was the first to tweet the hashtag #MatchAMillion, imploring her fellow stans to add another $1 million to BTS’s Black Lives Matter donation. They did so in a little over 24 hours. “It shocked me, because I didn’t realize how much influence we actually had,” she says. Since then, she’s been applying to grad schools and working with other young American ARMY members to rally opposition to Trump and his QAnon adherents. “The state of our country is getting to a really dark place,” she says. “I think it would be important to try and help against that in any way we can.” Or, as a repeated meme posted during the #WhiteLivesMatter keyword squat asks, “Will #Kpop a day keep #QAnon at bay?”The business of K-pop is largely apolitical, but the genre’s origins are anything but. The modern South Korean mashup of American hip-hop and pop-rock can be traced to 1992. For decades, officials in South Korea had frequently banned new music, movies, books, and newspapers with messages deemed outrageous or overly political. Into the spotlight stepped Seo Taiji & Boys, a try-hard boy band with a punk-rock look. They auditioned for a talent show on one of South Korea’s major TV networks with Nan Arayo (“I Know”), a hip-hop-influenced song that mashed together rap verses, pop choruses, and catchy dance moves. Although the group received the lowest score of the night from the show’s horrified judges, they won the popular vote—the track topped the country’s music sales charts for 17 straight weeks. Seo Taiji & Boys followed up that hit with risqué songs about censorship and youth oppression. When officials threatened to ban their music, fans rioted in the streets.A few years later, with South Korea in the grips of the Asian financial crisis, the government reversed tack and embraced pop culture as an economic lifeline, boosting its official culture budget. It began promoting K-pop, along with homegrown dramas and video games, as a core part of the nation’s identity. This was the start of what’s become known as the Hallyu (Korean wave) movement, which eventually swept the country’s pop culture westward.K-pop stans are tightly linked to the bands and their success. Official fan clubs have long contributed directly to funds set up to support artists through their ramen days. They also coordinate online efforts to boost the acts’ profiles, both through word-of-mouth and by buying extra copies of albums to push them up the sales charts. The advent of social media and streaming made it possible for K-pop acts to turbocharge fan loyalty by producing intimate videos almost nonstop, from short clips of them goofing around backstage to livestreams where they open up about their daily foibles as well as more serious mental health struggles.BTS, which made its debut in 2013, expertly synthesized these marketing strategies. ARMY began life as an official fan club, though it has grown much broader as it’s fought to penetrate America’s parochial music ecosystem. When U.S. fans began mass-calling hundreds of radio stations to play BTS, they came armed with prewritten scripts for any DJ who hadn’t heard of the band. Grassroots pressure from ARMY put BTS albums on the shelves of Walmart, Target, and Best Buy; landed BTS on The Ellen DeGeneres Show and Jimmy Kimmel Live!; and got them ringing in the New Year with Ryan Seacrest in Times Square. When Ticketmaster Entertainment Inc. put seats for a BTS tour on sale last year, all 300,000 tickets sold out in minutes, then the website crashed from the overload. When band member Jungkook told fans online that he uses a Downy fabric softener scent branded Adorable, two months’ worth of the global supply sold out in a day. And when the band endorsed the Hyundai Palisade last year, the SUV was on back order for months.Many ARMY members consider BTS their friends and revel in the band’s victories. These include the Big Hit IPO, which made the seven band members a combined $105 million, and this September’s chart-topping success of the band’s first English-language single, Dynamite, which also won four MTV video music awards. South Korea’s culture ministry estimates that the song will contribute $1.4 billion to the nation’s economy.The 10-figure haul is a testament to fans like Vivian Herr, a 43-year-old C-suite executive in Silicon Valley who falls asleep with BTS booming through her AirPods. Herr estimates she spent more than $16,000 on copies of Dynamite to push it up the Billboard rankings, including by sending money to hundreds of people in her Venmo contact list and asking them to download it. When she learned the song had hit No.\\u20091, she politely excused herself from a business meeting, darted into a nearby bathroom, and doubled over, screaming. Herr says her husband and kids don’t really get it.The video for Dynamite might not make the band’s je ne sais quoi especially obvious. You’ll see seven grown men jiving like it’s 1999 while they sing lyrics like “Dy-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na, life is dynamite.” Asked why they’re so devoted, ARMY members tend to say the same thing, often word for word: “I came for the music, but stayed for the message.” The members of BTS are Unicef ambassadors who support a wide range of charitable causes and stress the importance of self-acceptance. Despite Big Hit’s tight rein, the band also laces many of its lyrics and videos with imperatives to challenge the status quo. “Don’t get trapped in someone else’s dream,” BTS croons in the song N.O, a rejection of workaholic culture.Two years ago, when arenas were still a thing, Erika Overton rented a car and drove 10 hours from Detroit to New York to see BTS play Citi Field. The then-38-year-old contract recruiter had never been to a live concert before; she brought her 63-year-old mom, who’s also ARMY. “This is not just hysterical girls screaming over guys and thinking of nothing else,” she thought while looking up at her idols, the beat pulsing through her sneakers.Earlier that year, Overton co-founded One In An Army, which organizes monthly charitable-giving campaigns among its 150,000 Twitter followers. They’ve backed causes such as feeding starving children in Yemen and constructing water-treatment facilities in Tanzania. OIAA campaigns typically raised about $6,000 a month until this past June, when Agbakoba made #MatchAMillion trend.Black Lives Matter posed some uncomfortable questions for the K-pop industry. K-pop idols borrow more than just the kinds of hip-hop beats that originated in the Bronx. They also copy Black artists’ hair and clothing styles, dance moves, even mannerisms like a distinctive wag of the finger. ARMY has lost more than a few members uncomfortable with the online backlash to criticism along these lines. “That’s definitely the dark side of the fandom,” says Brie Statham, a 37-year-old BTS fan from Maryland. “It becomes really hard to be a Black K-Pop fan when you disagree with something like cultural appropriation and you get attacked for it.”Yet ARMY has also pushed its avatars to take a more active role in the U.S. protest movement. The day after Floyd died under a police officer’s knee in Minneapolis, Jiye Kim, a 26-year-old high school teacher in Sydney who runs one of the world’s biggest BTS fan accounts, woke to a relentless buzzing on her phone. Dozens of her quarter-million followers were demanding that she speak out against Floyd’s murder.Kim felt more than a little out of her element, not least because she couldn’t point to Minnesota on a map. Her claim to fame is speedy translation of BTS lyrics. When a new album drops, she’ll spend 14 hours translating the songs into English, even if it takes her until 4 a.m. on a school night. Soon, though, she was posting educational articles about police brutality in the U.S. “Not only is there an expectation that K-pop artists speak up in regards to social issues,” she says, “there’s now an expectation that fan accounts do, too.”A few days before ARMY hijacked #WhiteLivesMatter on Twitter, the Dallas Police Department unveiled a surveillance app called iWatch and asked citizens to send it videos of illegal activity during city protests against police brutality. Instead, stans crashed the app by flooding it with close-up clips of K-pop idols winking at the camera, a flex the cops attributed to “technical difficulties.” And ARMY members who took credit online for ruining Trump’s Tulsa rally posted videos of themselves doing the Macarena in front of their tickets or joking that they couldn’t go because they were walking their plants or feeding their pet rocks.On the surface, ARMY’s signal-jamming and GIF warfare might seem to echo the unsavory viral memes that helped drive support for Trump four years ago and lay the groundwork for QAnon. But K-pop stans came first, says Wasim Khaled. He’s chief executive officer of Blackbird.AI, a company governments and corporations hire to analyze digital disinformation campaigns and other forms of social media manipulation. He had to learn how to account for ARMY when developing Blackbird’s algorithms years ago, because the sheer volume of K-pop-related material was throwing off every large data analysis he tried to do. Once he learned what BTS was, it took a while to find a way to filter out the stans’ noise. The ripple effects of QAnon look much the same, he says: “Consider QAnon like conspiracy stans.”ARMY has been somewhat quieter in the presidential race’s waning months than they were this summer. Partly, that’s because the fandom has resisted co-option attempts by the Democratic Party mainstream. After Trump’s disastrous Tulsa rally, the Biden War Room, a grassroots outfit seeking to elect the ex-vice president, began tweeting lame “K-pop for Biden” memes and seeking stans’ support, only to earn replies such as “We don’t like you, either” and “hell to the no.”The fandom isn’t a monolith—it’s leaderless, hard to harness, and divided on the question of what to do next. Overton says ARMY should steer clear of politics to make sure the actions of some overzealous fan don’t backfire on BTS. Herr, in Silicon Valley, says getting involved is a credit to BTS and a part of ARMY’s civic duty. “The Trump administration’s message is racist, and it’s not what we believe or stand for,” she says. With like-minded stans, she’s talked younger and non-English-speaking ARMY members through voter registrations and helped organize get-out-the-vote efforts across California.Of course, QAnon and similar groups aren’t about to disappear after Nov. 3. If Joe Biden wins the presidency, ARMY’s political engagement could be all the more valuable in countering a fresh wave of revanchist conspiracy theorists, including Trump. If Trump wins reelection, his more paranoid supporters will likely plow additional resources into the strategies that have put QAnon followers on the ballot in several states. Either way, K-pop stans are “the only other online crowdsourced group that has the same kind of amplification power across social media networks,” Khaled says. “There’s definitely no other group that can go up against QAnon.”\\n \\nRead next: The Dark Side of K-Pop—Assault, Prostitution, Suicide, and Spycams(Updated seventh paragraph to clarify that BTS has pushed at the bounds of Big Hit’s control)'),\n",

       "  'After a great first year, the streaming service needs to convert viewers to paying subscribers, as Covid-19 clobbers Disney’s other businesses.Baby Yoda in The Mandalorian.SOURCE: DISNEY/LUCASFILMWhen then-Walt Disney Co. executive Kevin Mayer sat down with Hans Vestberg, the soon-to-be chief executive officer of Verizon Communications Inc., at the 2018 Sun Valley conference in the Idaho mountains, it was supposed to be a get-to-know-you chat. The annual conclave of media and tech heavy hitters is known as a place where deals are hatched—and this meeting didn’t disappoint.Mayer was plotting the launch of Disney+, the company’s big effort to compete with Netflix Inc. in the business of online video. Their talk set the stage for Verizon, the largest U.S. wireless carrier, to provide the service free of charge for one year to many of its mobile phone and internet customers. The offer gave the streaming service a boost when it premiered in November 2019, with Disney reporting more than 26 million subscriptions in the first two months, 20% of them from Verizon.The pair-up was one of many decisions Disney made that have helped lure more than 60 million customers to its streaming service. The company hit the low end of its five-year subscription forecast in just nine months and is expected to post an even bigger subscriber number when it announces quarterly results on Nov. 12. Even rivals are impressed. “If you’d asked us a year ago, ‘What are the odds that they’re going to get to 60 million in the first year?’ I’d be like, ‘Zero,’\\u2009” says Netflix CEO Reed Hastings. “I mean, how can that happen? It’s been a super-impressive execution for them.”With consumers reluctant to go to movie theaters or theme parks, Disney’s streaming operation has provided an outlet for the company to release new movies and keep families entertained at home. On Oct. 30 it begins the second season of The Mandalorian, the Star Wars TV show spinoff that proved to be the service’s biggest hit at launch.Per householdData: 7Park Data Inc.On Oct. 12, Disney announced it was reorganizing its TV, movie, and direct-to-consumer divisions, providing content in particular for the company’s growing lineup of streaming services, which includes ESPN+ and Hulu. Consumer behavior is driving the decision-making, says Disney CEO Bob Chapek. “We’re going to go ahead and take their cues,” he says. “And right now they’re telling us that they really want to see more and more content on Disney+ and Hulu.”Among the most critical decisions was to put almost all of the company’s most popular movies and TV shows on the service, from Walt Disney’s original animated hits all the way to new films such as last year’s Avengers: Endgame. The move meant scrambling to renegotiate contracts that had some films, including the Marvel and Star Wars franchises, airing on other outlets.Price was also a key consideration—just $7 a month or $70 for a full year. For a company known for obsessive customer research and premium pricing, the decision to undercut even Netflix’s entry-level $9-a-month fee was made quickly by Mayer—who left Disney earlier this year after being passed over as CEO—and then-CEO Bob Iger. The idea was to come up with an offer so low, customers would have a hard time refusing it. But price hikes could be coming. At an investor event last month, Chief Financial Officer Christine McCarthy said that “we priced Disney+ at a very accessible price point initially.” Another early call was agreeing to buy control of BAMTech, the video streaming arm of Major League Baseball, in transactions that totaled $2.6 billion and began in 2016. The business served customers such as the National Hockey League and HBO. Disney executives argued that having the technology in-house would give them a leg up in the streaming wars, pushing back against colleagues who said the benefits didn’t justify the cost, according to people familiar with the private discussions.As Disney+ nears its first anniversary, new challenges loom. The Verizon offer begins to expire for many customers on Nov. 12. In a recent survey conducted on behalf of research firm MoffettNathanson, 44% of Disney+ Verizon customers said they would renew, while 37% were undecided. Verizon is trying to lure customers into top-tier plans with a bundle that also adds Hulu and ESPN+.The streaming field is only getting more crowded. After a huge start to the year, Disney+ fell to fifth place in new subscriber sign-ups in the third quarter, from the top spot in the first quarter, according to Kantar, a consulting company. Peacock, the free service unveiled in July and being promoted heavily by rival Comcast Corp., was No.\\u20091.New content is also an issue. The number of Disney+ original episodes released in the third quarter, at 43, fell well below those of Netflix and Amazon.com Inc., according to MoffettNathanson research. (Disney says the number of episodes is higher.) The share of customers using the service daily dropped for the second quarter in a row.Like everyone else in Hollywood, Disney had to halt production because of the pandemic and is only beginning to ramp up. Filming of The Mandalorian’s second season wrapped just days before the shutdown. WandaVision, the first in a series of Marvel-themed shows, is set to premiere in December, as will Soul, a new Pixar film that was supposed to be released in theaters.“We will have something new virtually every week on our platforms, across all of our platforms, all of our franchises,” says Chapek, who took over for Iger in February, just as the virus was starting to spread around the globe. Although he came most recently from the theme park side of the business, the CEO is clearly glad Disney+ was there for him in this challenging year. “We’re not letting anything that’s happening in the short to medium term get us off track,” he says. “We’re going faster, bigger, stronger, along the same route that was set up six months ago, a year ago, year and a half ago. This is the direction of the Walt Disney Company.” —With Scott Moritz and Lucas Shaw\\n \\nRead next: Disney Mass Layoffs Signal Bleak Future for Tourist Businesses'),\n",

       "  \"The pandemic threatened to sink a new New Jersey beach destination, but the opposite happened.Visitors stroll the Wildwood, N.J., boardwalk in September 2020. Editor’s note: This article is part of a package about entrepreneurs who are trying something new.After more than two decades building a residential rental business in Philadelphia, Amy Santana and her husband Nick were ready to switch gears. She says they were increasingly frustrated that the city’s government was making it difficult for landlords to survive, and they were looking to spend more time with their children. “Child care, as you know, is outrageous,” she tells Businessweek.In 2015, the couple bought a highly distressed hotel in the island resort town of Wildwood on New Jersey’s shore. They started renovating the 22-unit property in 2018, investing everything they had to transform it into an 11-unit boutique hotel, including buying an additional property for overflow parking to comply with the town’s zoning rules.After spending about $2 million and booking roughly $100,000 in advance reservations by March, they planned to open it in April 2020. Santana, who had done design work for a hotelier with boutique properties in Miami’s South Beach, was excited to unveil what she had learned. “There’s no other hotel like it on this island,” she says.  Then Covid-19 struck, forcing them to delay their opening and spooking guests. Adding to their worries in May, the local convention center, a major source of guests just four blocks away, canceled all events for the remainder of 2020. To bring in extra cash, they rented out their own home in South Jersey, temporarily moving to a smaller place they own in Wildwood. “Everybody panicked and wanted a refund, which we gave,” she says.The Santanas first got into real estate in 1997, buying and renovating properties in Philadelphia, and then renting to students near Temple University. Over the years, they focused on serving low-income residents while working full-time jobs. Santana, who has a PhD, in education, became a school principal. Her husband worked in line construction for utility contractor Asplundh. “Our mantra was always quality housing for quality people, regardless of their economic standing,” Amy Santana says. “We’d both come from inner city, very humble, poor beginnings.”Their hotel, 5100 Vacation Club, aims for a different market: Families that can afford to take multiple vacations and seeking an upscale, Disney-like vibe at the beach, along with quality amenities and lots of space. Amy Santana had to adjust to the coronavirus pandemic fast. To coax would-be guests who were skittish of traveling during the pandemic, Santana lowered prices and offered a few of the hotel’s smaller units as seasonal rentals for professionals who were sick of working from home. “Hedging our bets” is how she describes it. She emphasized the hotel’s steady Wi-Fi, cleaning regimen, and clutter-free units that she says are “designed to be cleaned properly.” (Instead of floor lamps and throw pillows, think recessed lighting and fancy tile backsplashes.) Bookings were tepid when the state’s lodgings were allowed to open in June, but they brought in enough to cover the Santanas’ utilities and taxes. Their lenders—Liberty Bell Bank, Pursuit, and the Small Business Administration—helped them defer payments. “They were instrumental,” she says.Bookings grew stronger than she had been expecting and eventually filled the hotel through September. Santana says she’s been giving tours to wedding parties and church groups that are seeking to rent the entire property at times in the next season. She makes a point of highlighting the bamboo-dotted courtyard, where guests can gather outdoors and stage events to assuage concerns about viral spread.The Santanas’ roughly 30 properties, in Philadelphia, on the other hand, aren't performing. Tenants owe about $56,000 in rent, plus $80,000 in water and gas bills. Philadelphia has changed the rules to make landlords vulnerable to liens on those bills, she says. The Philadelphia Housing Authority has extended its eviction moratorium into March 2021.Santana, her husband, and her oldest son, who recently turned 15, have been running the hotel themselves, using a trusted cleaning company that lost much residential work because of the pandemic. Originally, Santana had planned to operate year-round. But because area venues are closed through 2020, she closed the 5100 Vacation Club at the end of September and will play by ear as to when to reopen in the spring. She doesn’t want to make advance bookings and then have to return guests’ money, as the Santanas did back in April.In the meantime, the couple is taking advantage of remote schooling and preparing to travel across the country with their five kids. They’re also figuring out the best way to deal with the Philadelphia properties—which might include selling half of them. Their next step could be to expand the Wildwood hotel. “God willing, we may build part two in 2022,” she says.\\n\\nAmy Santana’s advice for anyone forging a new business, or revamping an old one:Stay on top of local regulations. If you run a hotel on the Jersey Shore, you’ll need to know about beach openings and closings, because they'll have a material effect on your business. You'll also need to pay attention to trends, she says. For example, in Philadelphia, Santana is seeing homeowners flee crime while developers build homes that sit vacant. “It’s a fake bubble,” she says.\\n\\nGet tighter with your lender. “Make sure you have a good relationship with your lenders,” she urges. Expectations should be clear so you can plan to navigate uncharted waters. “Without our lenders' help, we wouldn't have made it,” she says. Santana makes it a point to email financial updates regularly and ask the lenders for help when necessary. Without good communication with a lender—or a lot of your own cash—you can’t move forward as adeptly as you’d like, she says.\\n\\nMore reading: A California Family Comes Together to Sell Pandemic Supplies; How to Launch a Pandemic-Proof Business; and Six Small Business Leaders on What It Takes to Survive the Pandemic Economy.For more stories, strategies, and advice for Main Street business owners, check out the Bloomberg Businessweek Small Business Survival Guide.\"),\n",

       "  'From casinos to theme parks, attractions that rely on crowds are being crushed by Covid-19.Caitlin Busscher, a nearly 10-year Walt Disney Co. employee, had been looking forward to returning to work after maternity leave. Busscher, who started out taking customer surveys on Main Street of the Magic Kingdom Park, worked her way up to designing custom tours for families coming to Orlando. Last week was supposed to be her first back. It didn’t turn out that way. Busscher was notified on Oct. 1 that her job was being eliminated—along with about 28,000 others at Disney’s pandemic-slammed U.S. resorts and consumer products division.“I think people understand it’s a business decision, it’s not personal,” says Busscher, 34, who’s looking for another job, possibly one that isn’t travel-related. “I don’t know what’s around the corner.”Theme parks, purveyors of family fun and good times, are looking like anything but the happiest places on Earth these days. In addition to Disney’s firing of about a quarter of the employees in its U.S. resorts business, other operators, including Comcast Corp.’s Universal Studios and SeaWorld Entertainment Inc., have idled or let go thousands of workers recently. That’s because attendance by domestic guests has been limited, both by social distancing requirements and the unwillingness of Americans to get on airplanes for family vacations. International visitors are almost nonexistent because of travel bans. In California, home to Disneyland, state officials have been reluctant to even let parks reopen.Data: Bloomberg Intelligence“People are just not ready to come back yet, and we’re experiencing that in every segment of the industry—theme parks, water parks, family entertainment centers,” says Dennis Speigel, a theme park consultant in Cincinnati. “It has been catastrophic.”The pain at the parks mirrors what other businesses dependent on travel and big crowds are experiencing, from casinos in Las Vegas to your local movie theater. With the virus still a significant risk, a feeling likely reinforced by President Trump’s diagnosis, it’s possible many tourist-dependent cities will see a second wave of economic damage this year, brought by the new rounds of job losses. “The Disney layoffs signal the leisure industry won’t be the same, not anytime soon,” says Mark Zandi, an economist at Moody’s Analytics. “It’s going to take two to three years to fully catch up. This is not coming back fast.”After shutting its parks in March, Disney kept paying its employees. A month later, it shifted to furloughs, meaning employees continued to receive benefits but didn’t get paid. When summer came and its Florida parks reopened to disappointing traffic, Disney began telling workers many wouldn’t be coming back. But the size of the cuts has shocked them nonetheless.Workers United Local 50, which represents food service staff at the still-shuttered Disneyland in Anaheim, Calif., stands to lose more than one-third of its 7,800 members in the layoffs, says Chris Duarte, its president. The union has spent the past few months running food banks, handing out boxes of pasta, canned pears, and peanut butter to out-of-work park staffers. It’s assisted them in applying for unemployment benefits and has prepared meals for those who’ve gotten the coronavirus.Negotiations have now begun with Disney over what role seniority will play in determining who gets cut, Duarte says. Discussions also involve the possibility of early retirement for some workers and ongoing health-care coverage. “What we know right now is how many,” he says. “The who is still yet to be determined.”Some of California’s unions pushed back on reopening earlier in the year, writing a letter to Governor Gavin Newsom in June urging him to make sure the parks were doing so in a way that protects employee safety. Soon after, Disney indefinitely postponed a planned mid-July reopening date for its California parks.More recently Disney’s unions turned to the governor again, asking him to sign legislation requiring companies to give priority to workers they laid off when they do rehire. Newsom vetoed the bill on Sept. 30, saying it was too broad.Relations between the company and the state’s leadership in Sacramento have grown frosty, with Disney Executive Chairman Bob Iger stepping down from a state reopening task force last week and Disney’s theme parks chief saying in the memo announcing the layoffs that the company’s predicament has been “exacerbated in California by the state’s unwillingness to lift restrictions that would allow Disneyland to reopen.” Besides strict distancing requirements, the state was proposing that the county where a park is located must be in the lower tier of Covid-19 cases statewide before it could reopen—potentially keeping Disney’s properties closed indefinitely.After preliminary guidelines for reopening began circulating last week, a theme park industry group told the governor they needed revising, and California’s health department delayed releasing them publicly.Newsom’s veto of the worker-rehiring bill was another disappointment in a year of them for Glynndana Shevlin, 60, a 32-year Disney employee who served as a concierge at the E-Ticket Club at the Disneyland Hotel in Anaheim. She’s waiting to hear if she’s among the workers to be let go.Shevlin was among the last employees locking up when the hotel closed in March and has been on unemployment for much of the year. She’s been able to keep up with her rent and other payments but worries that if she permanently loses her $18-an-hour job she’ll also be without health-care coverage. “We all thought we’d be back sooner,” she says. “We didn’t see the future being the way it was.”For workers at Disney’s Florida attractions, there’s similar uncertainty. About 14% of workers in the Orlando/Kissimmee area are employed in accommodation and food service, making it the nation’s second most tourist-dependent city (after Las Vegas), according to data researcher SeoClarity. With the entire industry hit by Covid, that doesn’t bode well for laid-off workers trying to find new jobs quickly.Maxine Wild, a wedding planner and 23-year veteran at Disney World, started a Facebook group in August to help furloughed workers find side gigs. Called Ear For Each Other, the group has since swelled to almost 12,000 members, with Disney chefs offering to deliver meals and others mowing lawns or washing cars. Seamstresses are selling Halloween costumes, bakers are baking cookies. Since the layoffs were announced last week, members have begun offering classes in résumé writing or just trading job leads. “We’re getting all these wonderfully talented people in the room,” Wild says. “It’s become a place of how to.”Disney is also taking a financial hit. Its theme park division could swing from a $4.9 billion pretax profit last year to a $1.5 billion loss in 2020, says researcher MoffettNathanson LLC. Earnings might not return to last year’s levels until 2024, the firm says.For all hotels in the Orlando and Anaheim areas, revenue per available room in August—normally one of the year’s strongest months—was down almost 70% from a year earlier, according to market researcher STR. Richard Maladecki, president of the Central Florida Hotel & Lodging Association, estimates that as many as a third of the region’s 125,000 hotel rooms are closed and will remain so through the end of October. The hotels that are open have been averaging occupancy of under 30%.Charles Schnaars, who runs the Destiny Palms Hotel near the Disney World complex, says just 12% of his rooms are full, when that figure would normally be as high as 70%. And the Christmas season isn’t looking any better, with bookings for December less than 10% of what they’d normally be. “It’s horrible,” he says.Lance Boyer, who with his wife, Karin, has for 24 years run Florida Dream Homes, a vacation home rental business, says he’s had almost no bookings for the past five months. Some of the people he’s depended on for listings have sold their properties or taken them off the market. The 59-year-old has survived on government stimulus funds, but they recently ran out and last week he sold his company truck for $11,000 to help pay bills. He’s hoping the federal government passes another relief bill soon. “We don’t need tax cuts for billionaires,” he says. “We need help for average Americans.”After reopening its Florida parks in July and seeing weak visitation from faraway guests, Disney said it switched to emphasizing locals. Len Testa, who follows theme park attendance for the site TouringPlans.com, says it’s now much easier for season-pass holders to get a spot on the parks’ reservation system, which is used to avoid overcrowding. He estimates attendance at Magic Kingdom has been at about 19,000 guests a day on weekends, well below the capacity of 90,000.There appear to be fewer kids, he says, although Disney disputes this. “When you see that big family, with everyone wearing the same color shirt, you notice it now,” Testa says. “It’s like, ‘Oh, they decided to come.’\\u2009”Park patrons are definitely experiencing a very different Magic Kingdom in the Covid-19 era, though a dozen visitors on Oct. 2 told a Bloomberg reporter that the new precautions don’t significantly detract from the fun.Roving Disney customer service workers chided patrons for letting their face coverings fall below their noses, and even families huddling together for photos in front of Cinderella Castle had to mask up.Lines for the rides appeared discouraging at first, as Disney spaced parties 6 feet apart for social distancing. The queue for the Seven Dwarfs Mine Train, for example, stretched the length of three football fields from the ride’s entrance, down the sidewalk, and around the back side of the artificial mountain. The wait time, though, was relatively short by Disney standards: 70 minutes on Oct. 2, compared with 2½ hours on some pre-pandemic peak days.Several customers said Magic Kingdom seems to be slowly gathering some momentum. The park was noticeably busier than a month or two ago, when wait times were as short as 20 minutes, a few said.Jacob Irwin, 44, had flown from Connecticut to be among 11 family members celebrating his parents’ 47th wedding anniversary. His brother and sister-in-law had visited Disney earlier in the summer and gave the family the thumbs-up after judging it clean. “Honestly the airport and the flights were more of a concern than the park,” Irwin says.Tori and Matt Minton, tending to their two young boys in the Tomorrowland area, had made the trip from Arizona because the much-closer California parks have yet to reopen. The extra distance wound up tripling the cost of the vacation, Tori says, but they were relieved to make the trip nonetheless. “After not traveling for so long, it definitely has been nice to be out of the home, out of the shell,” she says.Universal Orlando, home of the Harry Potter-themed lands, has been offering a promotion allowing Florida patrons who buy a single-day ticket to get into the park for the rest of the year. SeaWorld has offered free attendance to active-duty military and three family members. In California, parks have found ways to attract business even if they can’t let guests on their rides. Cedar Fair LP’s Knott’s Berry Farm in Buena Park is offering outdoor food-tasting events this fall. And Legoland, in Carlsbad, is staging an outdoor Halloween event for kids.Busscher, the former Disney parks employee, thinks it’s just a matter of time before people feel comfortable visiting the attractions again. She hit the Magic Kingdom resort the day after Disney announced its big layoffs, going with a friend to her favorite ride and one of the parks’ scariest: Big Thunder Mountain Railroad. “I hadn’t been on a roller coaster for months,” she says. “I just wanted to forget everything else for a little bit and feel like a child again.” —With Saijel Kishan\\n \\nRead next: Americans Are Driving Less Than Before Pandemic, and It’s Permanent'),\n",

       "  'Postmaster General Louis DeJoyPHOTO ILLUSTRATION: 731; PHOTOGRAPHER: TOM WILLIAMS/REUTERSIf there’s one thing Kenny Montgomery thought he could always count on, it was the arrival of the U.S. mail. He’d delivered it himself during heat waves and blizzards in Rochester, N.Y. He trudged through the city with a mail sack over his shoulder during the 1991 ice storm that closed businesses and government offices and left residents cowering in their homes without power. They might not have been able to turn on the lights, but they got their mail.Last month, however, on the morning of Aug. 1, Montgomery, president of the local branch of the National Association of Letter Carriers (NALC), saw his faith shaken. Almost 120 of his members reported to the city’s eight post offices, he says, and found that trucks had brought them packages from processing plants but not a single piece of what he classifies as mail. No letters, no bills, no postcards, greeting cards, magazines, catalogs, or fundraising appeals. “This is my 33rd year of service,” he says. “There are light days and there are heavy days, but I have never experienced a day where no mail shows up.”That’s when Montgomery began to fear for the future of the 245-year-old U.S. Postal Service. If this was the service Americans could now expect, why wouldn’t they turn to FedEx Corp., United Parcel Service Inc., or some other private operation that brings things to their doors? “If this continues, we’re going to lose the confidence of our customers,” he says. “It snowballs from there.”Montgomery says he knows who’s to blame: U.S. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, a former logistics company executive and financial supporter of President Trump, who took over the agency on June 15. DeJoy has said he wants to transform the Postal Service, which is facing an $11 billion loss this year. Widespread incidents of delayed mail have given rise to theories that DeJoy wants to disrupt the fall election on behalf of the president, who has called the USPS “a joke” and questioned its ability to handle an anticipated surge in voting by mail this fall. So has the Postal Service’s decommissioning of 671 mail-sorting machines across the country and the recent removal of 700 collection boxes. “They were caught red-handed doing this, and the whole country is in an uproar,” U.S. Representative Jamie Raskin, a Democrat from Maryland, said on Aug. 20 at a hearing held by the Congressional Progressive Caucus, a group of liberal Democrats.Two days later, Democratic Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi called her chamber back from summer recess to pass a bill to roll back changes that have taken place during DeJoy’s brief tenure. It also contains a $25 billion cash infusion to cover the USPS’s Covid-related losses, a standing House request since the spring. There’s little chance the Republican-controlled Senate will take up the bill, and even if it did, Trump would likely veto it. In yet another attempt to call into question the Postal Service’s competence, he’s argued that without these funds there’s no chance the USPS can handle the expected mountain of postal ballots. “If we don’t make a deal, that means they don’t get the money. That means they can’t have universal mail-in voting,” he told Fox Business on Aug. 13.This much is certain: The USPS can handle the election. The agency delivers 433 million pieces of mail a day, almost half the world’s volume. The total amount of election mail expected this year will amount to less than 2% of its total flow from mid-September to Election Day. “It’s literally a drop in the bucket,” says Paul Steidler, a senior fellow at the Lexington Institute, a conservative think tank, who studies postal issues.The removal of mailboxes and sorters isn’t as ominous as it might appear, either. It’s normal procedure for the USPS and a direct response to the collapse of mail volume. Total volume has fallen 33%, to 142 billion pieces annually, since it peaked in 2006. Volume for the service’s most profitable product, first-class mail, has fallen 44%, and the pandemic has only steepened the decline. Meanwhile, with stores closed and so many people at home, package delivery rose 50% from April through June. The Postal Service is struggling to keep up with Christmas-level loads at a time when Covid-19 has sidelined many of its workers.In short, it might not be the most fortuitous time to make major alterations to the USPS. But that’s not stopping DeJoy. For all the allegations that have been made about him, the truth is simpler. He’s a guy from the business world who’s trying to impose the kind of disruptive changes on a federal agency that might be applauded in the private sector but are guaranteed to provoke a backlash in Washington.Although the Postal Service is required by law to break even, it’s hardly a business. It was created to help democratize the country by binding it together. Because of this, you can send a letter from anywhere in the country to Alaska for 55¢. As has been noted many times, it might be the greatest bargain on Earth—and one that no private company would offer.In the name of saving the USPS, DeJoy is mulling changes that not only would affect delivery but could also undermine the service’s mission. Even in the best of times his moves might have eroded public confidence in the agency. Coming now, at a time of intense politicization, with the integrity of the election at stake, they could lead to something worse.As a business executive committed to showing a federal bureaucracy a thing or two about efficiency, DeJoy isn’t unlike former airline executive Richard Anderson, who put Amtrak on a path to profitability but resigned in April after a little more than two years of battling members of Congress and rail enthusiasts. Or perhaps a better example is Marvin Runyon, aka “Carvin’ Marvin,” a onetime auto industry executive whose tumultuous six-year stint as postmaster general was marked by staff departures, mail screw-ups, and a federal investigation of his involvement in talks to put Coca-Cola machines in post offices when his family held shares in the company.DeJoy’s ambitions dwarf what those men had in mind. During an appearance on Aug. 21 before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, he confirmed a report in the Washington Post that after the election he’ll pursue what promises to be a wrenching transformation of the USPS involving slimmer discounts for nonprofit mailers, higher package rates, and increased delivery prices for distant places such as Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. “We’re considering dramatic changes to improve the service to the American people, yes,” he said.Specifically, DeJoy said he was eyeing the Alaska Bypass, a USPS program that uses bush pilots to fly not only mail but also food to areas of the state not accessible by roads. The Alaska Bypass is one of those extraordinary things the USPS does in the name of connecting the country. DeJoy complained that it cost $500 million a year. The number seemed steep: A spokesman for Alaska Senator Dan Sullivan, a Republican, says the program’s cost last year was actually $123 million. Either way, DeJoy’s comments raised questions about the postmaster general’s commitment to parts of the country that are more expensive to serve.For now, however, DeJoy is focused on a single initiative: getting Postal Service trucks to run on time. “FedEx and UPS, everybody runs their trucks on time, right?” DeJoy testified. “That’s what glues the whole network together.” Perhaps, but FedEx and UPS deliver 16 million and 22 million items a day, respectively, a sliver of the Postal Service’s volume, and have no similar public service responsibilities.DeJoy’s critics have frequently said he lacks experience with the USPS and is therefore unqualified, but that’s untrue. Born in Brooklyn, N.Y., he grew up around the logistics business. His father ran a small trucking company on Long Island. DeJoy seemed destined for a different career, getting an accounting degree from Stetson University in Florida and working for a time as a certified public accountant. He returned to New York, though, in 1983, after his father was injured in an assault by two business rivals. DeJoy took over the family business, which became known as New Breed Logistics, and moved it in the early 1990s to High Point, N.C.The turning point for New Breed came when it won a contract to provide logistics support for USPS mail-processing centers, refurbishing and transporting mail-sorting equipment. DeJoy parlayed the deal into business with clients such as Boeing, Walt Disney, and Verizon Communications. “If you have a Verizon phone, I shipped it to you,” he told an audience several years ago at Elon University in North Carolina, where he’s a board member.DeJoy assiduously avoids publicity. (He declined to be interviewed for this story.) “He’s a pure numbers and operations guy,” says former North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory, a friend of DeJoy’s. “He doesn’t like BS. He doesn’t give BS, and he doesn’t take it.” DeJoy’s waspishness was evident when he testified before the House and Senate in August, mocking his questioners for failing to do more to help the USPS.In 2014, DeJoy negotiated a deal to sell New Breed, which by then had 6,800 employees, for $615 million to XPO Logistics Inc., a company that provides trucking support for the USPS during the holiday season peak. DeJoy stuck around for a year to run XPO’s North American supply chain business, then joined the board before stepping down two years ago. He still holds more than $25 million worth of stock in XPO, a holding he says the USPS’s ethics department vetted.DeJoy also got involved in politics. Along with his wife, Aldona Wos, he’s given a total of $2.6 million to Republican politicians and causes. He also hosted fundraisers for George W. Bush in 2006 and Trump in 2017. “I certainly don’t see myself running for public office,” DeJoy told a local business journal in a rare interview four years ago. “That’s just not my thing, although I love politics. I love supporting candidates.”This pastime wasn’t without its rewards. Wos, a physician, served as U.S. ambassador to Estonia under Bush, and Trump has nominated her to be the U.S. ambassador to Canada. DeJoy was selected for a position first held by Benjamin Franklin.In one sense, DeJoy is a throwback to another era at the agency. For much of its history, the postmaster general was picked by the president. Usually the job went to a political operative who then handed out postal jobs to party loyalists. The shining example would be Franklin Roosevelt’s postmaster general, James Farley, who ran the Democratic National Committee while simultaneously approving stamp designs.Because of mediocre management by patronage hires, the nation’s mail delivery operation almost unraveled in the 1960s. That prompted President Richard Nixon to sign the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970, creating the newly christened USPS, an independent agency whose chief executive officer would be selected by a bipartisan board of nine presidentially appointed governors. No more than five could belong to the same party. For the next 50 years, there would be no postmasters general with close ties to the White House.Under Trump, that changed. The president appointed a Republican-dominated board willing to name one of his top fundraisers to run the agency. The move was bound to create suspicion. Who would be running the agency—DeJoy or his friend in the White House?The new postmaster general sounded excited, in his own particular way, on his first day on the job, June 15. “As you will soon discover, I am direct and decisive,” he said in a video to his new employees, sounding like a CEO who’d just completed a hostile takeover. “I don’t mince words, and when I see problems, I work to solve them.” As he would later testify before the House and Senate, he immersed himself in postal issues, becoming fixated with trying to find operational efficiencies. They’d have to be significant ones. As his predecessor, Megan Brennan, told Congress last year, the Postal Service’s financial woes had caused it to default on $48 billion of mandated health-care prepayments for future retirees since 2012.DeJoy tried to operate quietly, as he’d done at New Breed. But that’s not easy at the USPS, which has more than 630,000 employees, many of them represented by various unions. In July internal USPS memos surfaced warning of major delivery disruptions to come. One of them, described as a “mandatory stand-up talk” meant to be given by managers to the rank and file, said late delivery runs from distribution centers to branch offices would no longer be allowed. “One aspect of these changes that may be difficult for employees is that—temporarily—you may see mail left behind or mail on the workroom floors or docks,” it said. In other words, trucks might now depart without all the mail in the building. That contradicted what union leaders say was the USPS’s longtime practice.Another memo, titled “PMG’s [Postmaster General’s] Expectation and Plans,” said overtime was being eliminated. “The USPS will no longer use excessive cost to get the basic job done. If the plants run late, they will keep the mail for the next day,” it said.DeJoy’s critics point out that overtime spending was up because of high rates of absenteeism. “In a pandemic, overtime is not a nice thing to have,” says U.S. Representative Gerry Connolly, a Virginia Democrat and member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. “It’s essential to getting the job done. Forty thousand postal workers have come down with Covid-19 or been quarantined. Forty thousand! That means there are worker shortages all around the country.”Connolly and other committee members sought answers from DeJoy about the memos and were told in a letter from USPS General Counsel Thomas Marshall that because neither had originated from the Postal Service’s headquarters, they “should not be treated as official statements of Postal Service policy.” The stand-up talk was produced by the leadership of the agency’s southern area between Florida and Texas, Marshall wrote, whereas the musings about DeJoy’s expectations were prepared by a “midlevel manager.” Even so, DeJoy had clearly conveyed a philosophy, and it was guiding managers.In Rochester, the NALC’s Montgomery started getting calls from customers who wanted to know the whereabouts of their late packages. He says he toured the local plant and saw mail carts overflowing with parcels. Rob Stahl, an electrical technician at the facility and president of the local American Postal Workers Union chapter, says that’s been the case since area managers implemented DeJoy’s new plan. “They came down and said that the trucks leave on time no matter what,” Stahl says. “Sometimes they leave empty.”Paul Hogrogian, president of the 44,000-member National Postal Mail Handlers Union, says he discussed this problem with DeJoy in late July and the postmaster general was unworried: “He’s insisted, ‘We have to make the trucks run on time. We’ll get the mail to the platform eventually. Temporarily, there may be some unintended consequences, but we’ll get it to work.’\\u200a”Publicly, the postmaster general said little, which was probably ill-advised. He was, after all, someone who’d donated $1.2 million to the Trump Victory fund, which is devoted to reelecting a president who was discouraging people from voting by mail.On July 29 there were outraged cries from Democratic leaders when Marshall sent letters to 48 states and the District of Columbia warning that “certain deadlines for requesting and casting mail-in ballots are incongruous with the Postal Service’s delivery standard.” In a state such as Montana, he noted, voters can request ballots from election officials as late as the day before the election. Marshall advised states to urge residents to ask for them early.He also recommended that states send blank ballots to voters via first-class mail, which arrives in two to five days, rather than via the cheaper option of marketing mail, which takes as long as 10 days. As with other moves under DeJoy, it might have been interpreted differently in a different time; Marshall had sent out a similar warning in May, before DeJoy took over, and no one seemed to take offense. “I mean, it’s so normal,” says Paul Vogel, a former USPS chief marketing officer who oversaw vote-by-mail operations from 2010 to 2013. “Especially if there are states that don’t [vote by mail] traditionally.” Nevertheless, a half-dozen states cited the new letters, along with the vanishing mailboxes, in lawsuits accusing DeJoy of scheming to suppress the mail-in vote.At a USPS board meeting on Aug. 7, DeJoy vowed that the Postal Service would do whatever it took to safeguard voting by mail. He dismissed allegations that he was taking orders from Trump. He remained circumspect, however, about the changes he was making, speaking only vaguely about how he was trying to get the USPS to stick to its schedule and avoid unnecessary overtime. As for delays, he said they were “isolated operational incidents.”DeJoy’s assurances did little to quell the furor. Nor did his attempt to assuage his critics by halting the removal of sorting machines and mailboxes until after the election. Protesters congregated outside his homes in Greensboro, N.C., and Washington, beating drums and calling for him to be removed. Ronnie Stutts, president of the 115,000-member National Rural Letter Carriers Association, visited the postmaster general at USPS headquarters around this time. “He was almost in tears,” Stutts recalls, adding that DeJoy said, “I’ve had to hire a bodyguard to escort my daughter to and from school. She’s really upset with me. She’s asking me, ‘Why are you doing this, Daddy? Why would you do this?’\\u200a”Most Americans didn’t get their first look at DeJoy until late August during his appearances before Senate and House committees. As much as he tried to be polite, he often came across like someone who’s rarely had to explain himself and was offended by the very idea of being interrogated by people who’d never run a business. Asked by one congressman why he didn’t just leave all the sorting machines in place until after the election, DeJoy replied, “In Washington it makes plenty of sense. To me it makes none.”DeJoy tried to portray what he’d done in his short stint at the USPS positively, saying on-time trucking dispatching had risen from 89.4% to 97%, which he predicted would lead to annual savings of $1 billion. Democrats, on the other hand, produced internal USPS documents showing that since DeJoy had taken over, on-time delivery of all classes of mail had plummeted, in some cases by 7% or 8%. DeJoy said he had a mitigation strategy, but it wasn’t working as quickly as he’d expected. “I’m trying to figure that out,” he said.At any rate, the postmaster general told the House oversight committee, he couldn’t be blamed for everything that went wrong at the USPS. “I’m not the COO,” he said. “I’m the CEO of the organization.” Republicans were understanding, but Democrats proclaimed astonishment. “You’re supposed to be a logistics expert, right?” asked Democratic U.S. Representative Jimmy Gomez of California. “I think it’s time for you to resign, not because necessarily there is this grand political conspiracy, but just the incompetence that we’ve seen when it comes to the Postal Service.”DeJoy seems to understand that he’ll never transform the USPS as long as it’s engulfed in controversy. He testified to the House committee that, yes, he’d had contact with some of his friends in the Trump campaign. But it was to ask them to do something about the president’s unceasing attacks on vote-by-mail. “I’ve put the word out to different people that this is not helpful,” DeJoy said.In late August the USPS released a report showing that on-time delivery for most mail categories had started to recover. DeJoy has been filming a public service address with union leaders, some of whom fear the service’s reputation is being damaged by the controversy. “We’re doing a video showing the American public that voting by mail is safe and that the Postal Service is ready, willing, and able to process ballots,” says Hogrogian, of the National Postal Mail Handlers Union. “I think a joint message is good. There’s been enough negative press generated by the White House that we can’t handle it.”If the attacks on mail-in voting discourage a large number of people from casting ballots, effectively disenfranchising them, the implications go beyond the vote count. What could make people more cynical about an institution that has been a democratizing force for 245 years? This jadedness could lead to Americans no longer supporting its mission—and once that happens, why not charge more for a letter to Alaska? Or why deliver mail at all in sparsely populated parts of Montana and North Dakota, where sometimes postal workers can carry every letter from their route in their shirt pockets? When the time for that logic arrives, the postmaster general has a plan. '),\n",

       "  'Everyone’s vote is important, but thanks to the Electoral College, some votes in America matter more than others’. In election years past, we often heard about a key bloc that candidates needed to win over—think Soccer Moms in the 1990s and Nascar Dads in the 2000s. Now, in an increasingly diverse (yet polarized) country slogging through both a pandemic and an economic crisis, whose votes do Donald Trump and Joe Biden need most? Pollsters and analysts helped us identify nine groups who will likely determine the outcome of 2020.The people profiled here don’t necessarily represent large swaths of the electorate. As in 2016, a razor-thin margin—even a fraction of 1%—in a few swing states counts for more than a wall of blue in California or of red in Oklahoma. In the battleground state of Florida, for instance, Puerto Ricans who moved to the state following Hurricane Maria may have outsize importance. In other swing states, “Double Haters”—voters who are cool on both main candidates—could be pivotal, but only if they turn out. And will the votes of “Shy Trumpers” cancel out the votes of “Swinging Seniors” who say they’ll desert the president for Biden?Despite the range of opinions expressed by these voters, one shared by many is that neither of the major parties speaks for them. “I’m a Republican mostly in the fiscal sense. I align more closely with the Democratic philosophy on social issues,” says Robin Schelstraete, a voter in Nebraska. “It’s always a struggle for me to vote, because I feel like there isn’t a party that I’m 100% in line with.” Many also said they craved a sense of national unity. “The thing that concerns me most right now are the divisions that exist, the extremes,” says Don Phillips, a retiree who lives in Florida and North Carolina. “We just can’t get together and get anything done. If this pandemic can’t unite us, I don’t know what can.”In 2016 the Trump and Clinton campaigns competed vigorously for an unlikely group: people who disliked both candidates but were still likely to vote. Trump’s campaign dubbed them Double Haters, and in the closing days they broke decisively for him. This year, the Double Haters could once again factor heavily in the race—however, voters with unfavorable views of Trump and Joe Biden are an entirely different group than last time. A Civiqs tracking poll finds that they’re primarily young, disillusioned progressives who, if they voted in the Democratic primaries, went overwhelmingly for Bernie Sanders (69%). Many don’t identify as Democrats, or do so reluctantly: 52% are independents, 40% are Democrats, and 8% are Republicans. But Biden is in a much stronger position with these hostile voters than Clinton was four years ago. Civiqs finds that Double Haters prefer Biden over Trump 58% to 4%. The rest say they’re voting for someone else or are unsure who they’ll vote for. —Joshua Green“[Biden] supports essentially none of the positions that I do. I’m not interested in voting for the lesser of two evils if that ‘lesser evil’ will continually get more evil.”“I’m a high school teacher. I work in low-income neighborhoods. In Houston, Covid has been awful. I’m no fan of Biden’s. But at least he acknowledges it’s an issue and doesn’t try to pretend that it’s not happening. When I vote, I’ll be looking at it through the lens of doing the right things for my kids, not just for me. They can’t vote. But if they could, what would they be worried about?”“Biden isn’t making any real attempts to bring the left into his coalition. At a time where protests are happening across the country to highlight systemic racism, he refuses to support legalizing marijuana, [which has been] a catalyst for the mass incarceration of people of color. At a time in which millions of people are losing health care due to losing their jobs because of Covid, he refuses to support Medicare for All. If Biden doesn’t move left, he should not feel entitled to support from the left.”“With Biden, I feel like we’re on repeat from 2016. We’re getting a centrist from the old guard of the Democratic Party who won’t make concessions, when I think we need major change. I’m conflicted, because I know some things would be better under Biden. As a member of the LGBT community, my rights could be threatened if the margin on the Supreme Court tilts any more toward conservatives. Living in a swing state like North Carolina does weigh on me a lot, because ultimately just a few people’s votes could end up deciding the election—and if Trump were reelected, I’d feel pretty torn up.”In 2016, Trump’s data analysts posited a group of voters who liked him and intended to vote for him, but were too embarrassed to admit their preference to pollsters. Trump did, indeed, overperform relative to polls in 2016. Was it because of “Shy Trumpers”? There’s debate about whether Shy Trumpers still exist—or ever did. Some people think they were there in 2016 but vanished, because whatever social penalty applied to supporting Trump disappeared once the Republican Party embraced him. Others think the Shy Trumper effect was the result of bad polling that’s since been corrected. Still others, including the Trump campaign, think these bashful supporters endure. If that’s true, they could once again tip a close race. —Fola Akinnibi, Amanda Albright, and Kelsey Butler“There are so many people who feel so shamed, or that they don’t belong, or are afraid to share their views, because the other side has come out and said, ‘You’re not allowed to think like that, you’re not allowed to say that, you’re not allowed to vote for this person.’ It’s that type of language. I’ve seen it a lot over the past three months with politicizing the virus, politicizing medicine, and Black Lives Matter and police.“I’ve lost a friend. When Brexit was happening, he started complaining and said the votes have to be rigged and this can’t be real. I said, ‘For you to be in this box and to ignore other people’s views, it just shows how blind a liberal you are,’ and he got very offended that I called him a blind liberal and unfriended me everywhere. I haven’t talked to him since.“You can push back with your mouth and you can push back with your vote. I’m not allowed to say anything anymore. I’m not allowed to share my views, share my thoughts. I think that’s a really sad state of affairs that we’re in.”“I am pro-America, I’m pro-capitalism. I do not believe in big government, nor socialism. I do not believe in a culture of government dependency, but I do believe in helping those less fortunate, especially in times of need. With that, I do believe in the free market, and I believe it’s historically been proven to promote prosperity. I plan to vote for Trump, because I believe he is the best candidate to provide and set us up for a prosperous future.”“My top issue is definitely abortion. Admittedly, in [Trump’s] history he wasn’t really the most pro-life person around. But I think it was the third debate in 2016, [he] was probably one of the first presidential candidates to speak so boldly about the horrors of partial-birth abortion. And then, for the most part through his presidency, he has kept every pro-life campaign promise he made.“I think one point [that people get wrong about Trump supporters] is just assuming that they’re White supremacists. I’m not White, I’m Hispanic. My mother is from Colombia, she immigrated here legally. My dad’s from Uruguay, he immigrated here legally. And I guess I’m not exactly a White person, and I’m a Trump supporter. There are plenty of people out there who aren’t White who support Trump. And also [people wrongly assume] that they’re uneducated—because I’m very educated. I have a master’s degree in moral theology. It seems just like there’s the assumption that Trump supporters are in general hateful people, that they hate women, or gay people or Muslim people.”“When I was younger, I worked in an industry where I was the lone conservative with a bunch of more liberal-leaning people. And every day we would talk political stuff, and it was so much fun. That was back when you could talk politics with people and actually disagree, and we still loved each other. And that’s not the case now. There’s a really good family friend of ours, that if I told him I was a Trump supporter, he would stop being our friend, and that hurts me.”Political analysts have been puzzled by an anomaly in Trump’s polling support. A steady series of polls has shown that more voters approve of his policies than plan to vote for him in November. This is unprecedented in recent political history. Approval ratings have always run even with voting intent, which intuitively makes sense: If you approve of a president’s policies, you’ll probably vote for them again. Pollsters have speculated about what accounts for this gap, and the likeliest explanation is “Tired Trumpers”—Republicans and independents who liked the good economy, liked Trump’s judges, and initially liked the idea that he’d come to Washington and shake things up, but have grown exhausted by and disillusioned with his behavior. If the president can’t find a way to revivify this group, he may be toast. —Esmé E. Deprez, Bryan Gruley, and Mark Niquette“I like most of the things that he’s done. I wish he could find a little bit kinder and gentler way to do some of them, though. I think Mr. Trump opens his mouth before he thinks about what he’s going to say, and I wish that he would or could change that—and I don’t think he can. I don’t think that’s ever going to happen.“He would have a better chance of getting his point across if he catered more to the moderate voter out there.“I think Biden will have an edge in some states. And I think that some of that is Trump’s fault, and I think some of it is not. I certainly don’t think we can blame this virus on any one person or party.”“[Trump] isn’t in this for the country, he’s in it for himself. I’m just sorry we don’t have a better person to get behind. Maybe I won’t even vote at all. I’m a conservative, I believe in conservative values. I think there are people out here who are good leaders, but I don’t think Trump is interested in leading the country. It’s just a shame, because we don’t have an alternative. I’m not going to vote for Joe Biden. That’s not a better option.”“His rhetoric is awful. People say he punches back, but he\\'s the most powerful person in the world—you don\\'t really have to go after this person and that person who’s below you. I just think it\\'s childish and unnecessary.“The pandemic response has been very, very bad—the nail in the coffin of why I wouldn’t vote for him.”“In 2016, I just felt I had to vote for Trump. I just couldn’t stand the thought of Hillary being president.“I liked the fact that [Trump] was a businessman, and I thought the country needed a leader who wasn’t really a politician but a businessman, so he could bring that perspective. I wish to this day he would stay off social media and maybe think things through better before he opens his mouth. It’s given me a reason to rethink this time around.“I probably would have voted for Biden last time around. What makes me hesitate this time is, I’m not sure he’s capable of it. He doesn’t seem to be able to gather his thoughts well enough to run the country. I’m worried about his mental state, to be honest. I would love to see a debate.“I think from the beginning, Trump said he was going to handle [the pandemic], and then it seemed like the governors wanted to make their own decisions, and he stepped back. And now he’s being criticized unfairly for that.”“My desire was that Trump was going to return to being the real estate developer from the ’80s. My concern was that we were going to get the game show host. We got the game show host.”The protests this summer that followed George Floyd’s killing by a police officer in Minneapolis have already changed Americans’ political attitudes on issues of racism and police violence. Will they also activate a new wave of voters? There’s evidence to suggest they might. As Floyd’s family and others encouraged protesters to register, some Democratic data groups saw an increase in the number of people registering and volunteering. Strong support for Black progressive candidates like Jamaal Bowman and Mondaire Jones in Democratic primaries is another indication of this group’s potential power. But will they turn out for a 77-year-old White man who authored the 1994 crime bill and his running mate, a former prosecutor? The answer could be pivotal in key battleground states from Georgia to Arizona. —Suma Hussien, Polly Mosendz, and Linda Poon“How does an African—I’m first-generation Nigerian American, I wasn’t born in America—who hasn’t experienced the same things that Black Americans face, how do you get involved in something from the inside that you don’t feel you\\'re a part of? But then you realize, ‘Hey, you’re as Black as the next person. It doesn’t matter.’ And it goes to show that we’re all in this together. If I live in this country, I just have to be active.“The same day that George Floyd had passed, Dion Johnson here in Phoenix was shot by police officers. So I went to that vigil, and that was my first vigil and protest ever—even when I did vote and I knew there were protests going on with Black Lives Matter and things of that nature. I just never put myself in that space.“I went to that vigil and my first protest. I’m like, ‘OK, how do I get involved?’ I had a friend who met me at another protest, and she introduced me to [someone] who is actually running for a legislative seat. I talked to him, and he connected me with a pastor who is very active in the community.“I spoke at my first city council meeting last Thursday, and I had a comment because they were trying to raise the police budget from $500 million to $745 million. We’re still in Covid, there’s homelessness, affordable living [and] mental health issues, and yet you’re giving the police force more money—for what, I don’t understand—as people are dying.“I’m a progressive Democrat, so I’m on that side of the playing field. I’m all for seeing change for everybody—Black, indigenous, Hispanic, the LGBTQ community. We have a diverse America now, so we need new faces. So I’m voting for Joe because obviously he makes more sense than Trump.”“I’m really excited to vote in November, since it’s my first general election, and I’m planning to vote for Democrats up and down the ballot. I’m especially excited to vote in my state legislature races. Something that’s really important to me is voting rights and making sure everyone can have their voice heard in their election. I saw how close Stacey Abrams came to being our governor and the role that voter suppression had [in the Georgia gubernatorial election in 2018]. I’ve become really passionate about electing people that protect our voting rights.”“If fighting for Black lives is radical, then I’m radical. If fighting for Medicare for All is radical, I’m radical. If fighting for the Green New Deal is radical, I’m radical. This movement awakened a new generation of revolutionaries.”“I’m voting for Biden and Kamala [Harris] because, you know, Trump getting another four years is going to be detrimental to my community and my identity as a Black woman. It’s going to be detrimental to immigrants, trans people everywhere. So, yeah, that’s unfortunately my only option. I don’t agree with a lot of Biden’s choices and some of Kamala’s choices in the past as well.”“This spring we saw Ahmaud Arbery, then we saw Breonna Taylor, then we saw George Floyd die. No, let’s be clear, murdered. So I hit the streets like everybody else.“At the root of it, the demands are basic. To stop killing us and to stop upholding the systems that have been enslaving and killing us for the last 400 years.“I think we’ve all genuinely been through some severe suffering in the last four years with [Trump]. And I don’t think that’s something that any of us want to go through again. And I think because of that, it is going to push more people out to vote. But I think also because our nominees are both shitty people that [some young] people are very hesitant.“This is no longer snack time in the third grade. This isn’t just, ‘You get what you get, and you don’t get upset.’ We have the power to make sure this Cheeto doesn’t get back in office. We have the literal power.”There\\'s little chance Trump will win over the majority of Black and Latino voters as he seeks reelection. His prospects of attracting people of color were slim even before Biden tapped California Senator Kamala Harris to be his running mate. Harris’s status as the first Black woman and first Asian American to be on a major party’s presidential ticket is likely to excite an electorate hungry for more diverse faces in Washington. Yet Trump has always made the case that it’s Democrats who have taken Black and Hispanic Americans for granted while failing to deliver on the goals they have long promised: jobs that pay, schools that work, and a criminal justice system that’s fair. In 2016, Trump won 8% of Black voters and 28% of Hispanic voters, outdoing former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney’s performance among those groups in 2012. Support for Trump from minorities has been particularly high among young men and those without a college degree, says American University professor David Barker, who recently released a study on Black voters. The Trump campaign is betting that this year he can gain even more traction. —Naomi Nix“I remember what led me to Trump. There was a debate, and they had I think seven guys left and they put Trump in the middle—I’m sure to try to make him look silly being surrounded by six career-long politicians. The [moderator] asked the question in the very beginning: If you were not the one chosen to represent the Republican Party, raise your hand if you would step out and support whoever was nominated. Every single person raised their hand except for Donald Trump. He said, ‘I’m not running for the Republican Party’s nomination. I’m running for the American people.’ And it was such a different move than what every other politician would do, would be willing to do, which is bow to their party. It was refreshing.”“I wanted a candidate who would take his thumb and literally stick it in the eye of the average politician. I wanted some guy who would fight for me, who I could count on. Now, Trump isn’t a politician. He doesn’t know how to speak political talk. That attracted me to him. I like the fact that he fights. I like the fact that he’s politically incorrect. I think we have too much political correctness.“I grew up as a Democrat because that’s what my parents were. That’s what my neighbors were. That’s what my city was. It was never even thought to be a Republican. I want to show people that Black voters are being taken advantage of and for granted. The moment a person can look at you and instantly have a pretty good idea of how you are going to vote, you have lost some power. We need to get our power back because this is our country, too.”“The first thing that attracted me—that opened my ears up—is when he came to the podium at one of his rallies. He said, ‘You know what, you guys have been voting Democrat for so many years. Your schools are in a bad place. Your neighborhoods are in a bad place. Your education is in a bad place.’ And he spoke into the mic and he said, ‘Vote for me. What do you have to lose?’ I never heard a president saying things like that.”“I liked his border protection policy. I experienced the wave of illegal immigrants coming into a lot of Black communities. I have [witnessed] a lot of racist stuff that’s happened between Mexicans and Blacks. He was talking about securing up the border. You can’t have a sovereign nation if you don’t have some type of protection.“I believe [Black Lives Matter] is a fake organization that is around to play on Black people’s emotions in order to get them to donate to the Democratic Party. When little babies die by the hands of another Black person, [the activists] are nowhere to be found. You don’t see them marching in the streets in the South Side or West Side of Chicago.”Initially, the coronavirus pandemic boosted Trump’s approval rating. But as his administration\\'s botched handling of the crisis became clearer, and infections and deaths mounted, research from the data firm 0ptimus found it activated two groups of voters who pose a threat to his presidency: Republicans for whom the coronavirus was the last straw, and Democratic and independent voters who don’t always vote, but who tell pollsters that the pandemic will summon them off the couch into the voting booth come November. —Riley Griffin“The 2016 presidential election was the first in which I was old enough to vote. I remember checking on my registration status in Georgia and realizing it was too late. So I resigned myself to the decision I had made by putting it off, and didn’t vote.“The pandemic really quickly hit very close to home for my family. My parents, who were empty nesters, had me and my two sisters all in the house for the first time in seven years. We all started showing symptoms in late March. But my dad just never got better.“[Doctors] put him on two different drugs, one of them being hydroxychloroquine. He couldn’t sleep, and his heart was racing. It was 1 a.m. on Tuesday morning, and he was visibly not OK. Me and my mom rushed him to the hospital. It turned out once we got there that at some point that night he had been having a heart attack. His main artery to his heart was completely blocked, and they had to operate ASAP.“We spent the next three weeks living phone call to phone call. And watching the death toll rise every day while he was in the hospital was hard because we knew how highly the odds were stacked against him. That was the same period in which Trump said he’d been taking hydroxychloroquine for weeks, that it was a ‘wonder drug.’ The doctors had told us that could have been the thing that killed my dad. We knew how many other people could potentially be in our shoes, and to have our leader promoting bad science was really maddening.“They tried to exit my dad from the ventilator once or twice, but he had to be put back on because his oxygen levels just got too low. At one point, six doctors were standing over him, asking themselves, ‘What are we going to do?’ because he was dying. But he turned a corner, and we were victorious after that hellish month of April.“I’m just incredibly frustrated that we’ve managed to politicize what should be a simple, black and white, scientific and humane topic. My family’s experience has only solidified my resolve to engage more politically, vote in November, and start having these uncomfortable conversations with fellow community members.”“My first presidential election was 1976. I voted for Ford. I\\'ve voted Republican ever since. This will be the first year I vote for a Democrat. Trump had an opportunity to do some good things, to show some leadership, with the pandemic. But if you could pick the wrong steps someone could make, he’s been making them.“The piecemeal approach has been bad. I have a 14-year-old son; I’m struggling with sending him to school or not. I struggle with it because he could bring the disease home that would affect me, as someone immunocompromised, having received a heart transplant.”“I\\'m socially liberal, fiscally conservative, and I\\'ve never voted for a Democrat in a presidential election. In 2016, I didn\\'t vote for either Clinton or Trump.“Trump could be saying, ‘Let\\'s figure this out,’ and uniting the country against the coronavirus, and he\\'d probably win the election. Instead, he continues to promote fear and divisiveness around the pandemic, pitting people against each other, including families and friends. In 2020, I will not be voting for Trump and I hope that\\'s a wake-up call for the Republican Party.”In recent years, no group of voters has been more solidly Republican than seniors—especially White seniors. A Harvard University study found that, in 2016, Trump won senior voters by 13 points overall, while exit polls show he won White senior voters by 20 points. But that strength has vanished. No group has swung harder to Biden than seniors. Most recent polling shows Trump and Biden roughly tied among 65+ voters. And because seniors are overrepresented in battleground states such as Florida, Arizona, and Michigan, they could prove to be the key deciders in the election—if they stick with Biden and don’t swing back to Trump before November. —Michael Smith“I am what I consider a fairly standard Republican. I am pro-life. I also believe that compassionate and controlled capitalism is the best economic model. So, for those reasons I voted for Mr. Trump. It was very refreshing that he was using Twitter. You got to see what he was saying without spin. However, Mr. Trump seems to spin everything to be about himself.“He has caused an even greater polarization between the two major parties than there was. This is a tragedy, it’s stupid, it causes our lawmakers to be doing lots of things but not looking out for us.“Unfortunately, it becomes a choice between a dangerous megalomaniac who does not seem to respect any boundaries and someone who represents a party who is for murdering babies. Mr. Biden himself, historically, apparently has been against abortion. [In 1973, Biden said the Supreme Court went “too far” in its Roe v. Wade decision, and in the 1980s and 1990s he voted against federal funding for abortion and procedures abortion opponents refer to as “partial-birth” abortion; this year Biden reversed his position on federal funding and said he supports codifying Roe v. Wade as federal law.] So we’ll take a chance and vote for Mr. Biden. But I will probably, when in doubt, vote for Republicans elsewhere.”“I am about the worst thing for Trump. I am 68, a senior in a swing state, North Carolina, and I voted for him in 2016. And I supported many of the things he has done. But no way will I vote for him in 2020. It’s just been too much. Every day has been like a wild ride.“On one side are the behavioral issues. He’s a sociopath, a liar, a narcissist, and a bully. Then you add to that the fact that he has shown, in my opinion, zero leadership in the two biggest crises he has faced as president: the Covid pandemic and the racial crisis after the killing of George Floyd.“I’m a conservative, very Republican. I have supported his tax cuts, his reduced regulatory regime, his energy policy, and his Supreme Court nominees. I have supported all of this. But I look at this and wonder how can I explain to my grandchildren. I want to say I voted for someone who will make America a better place. And that is not Trump. As for Joe Biden, I think he is a decent and honorable man. We need someone who can bring this country together.”“I would say I reluctantly voted for [Trump in 2016]. I traditionally voted Democratic. I would never vote for him again. It’s just the way he conducts himself personally. All the juvenile name-calling, the insults. I don’t know if he’s a racist. I just think there’s a lot of bluster and not a lot of getting things done. It turns out that a lot of the things he promised to do, in his platform, he’s not done. The idea of blaming other presidents, other people, and never taking any responsibility, doesn’t sit well with me at all.“I am comfortable voting for Biden. I think he’s had a long, distinguished career. I wish he were younger, but he’s not. Given the two choices, I definitely favor Biden. They try to make him out to be a senile old fool; I don’t think he is. He’s got the experience. I think he’s calm. I think he cares about people.”After Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico in 2017, the extended suffering caused an exodus. About 400,000 Puerto Ricans relocated to Florida, many settling around Orlando and altering the political composition of a perennial swing state. Puerto Ricans now rival Cubans as the state’s largest Latino group. A Republican pollster says that if two-thirds of the 400,000 had participated in the 2016 election and voted as polls suggest they would have (favoring Democrats over Republicans 70% to 30%), Trump wouldn’t have won Florida.Democrats have scrambled to register Puerto Rican transplants and turn them out. In Miami and Tampa, Biden’s Spanish-language ads feature a narrator with a Cuban accent, but in the Orlando market, the narrator’s accent is Puerto Rican. However, modeling conducted by the Florida Democratic Party found that 220,000 of these new Floridians aren’t yet registered. And getting them to the polls will be tricky. Many struggle to find steady jobs and housing. Others are working multiple jobs or navigating language barriers. All have endured stressful migrations. The Covid-19 pandemic is an added hurdle. —Joshua Green“I came eight months after Maria. There was nowhere on the island I could go and find a good job. It’s expensive here. I got a full-time job at Disney and still had to get an extra part-time job to pay the security deposit on an apartment. It’s crazy, but I consider myself really lucky.“I’m a Fairy Godmother at Disney World in Cinderella’s Castle. It’s literally my dream job. The little girls come in, and we transform them into princesses, give them the royal treatment: hair, dress, nails. At the end we turn them around, and it’s super beautiful to see their little faces react.“At first, I was shocked by Covid. At Disney, we didn’t want to believe it because we have so many contacts with people around the world. It was so stressful when things shut down. Disney is reopened, but my job is not open yet. Now it’s getting to the point where I’m getting anxiety and depression again. How am I going to survive on $200 a week?”“We thought it would be easier for the family in Florida. It’s still been hard. At first we had to walk because we didn’t know the bus system. I wrote a hip-hop song about being homesick and missing Puerto Rico that got onto the radio station and gave me a good start. I told my wife, ‘The Spanish ads you hear on the radio here are really bad.’ I thought, I can do this better. So we started a production company.“We work all the time, but my girls are in a good school. We just bought a house. I joined the Chamber of Commerce—I’m the only hip-hop artist! I guess it’s the American dream. I’m still thinking about who to vote for.”“I want to feel—as a Hispanic, a Puerto Rican, and a Latina—heard and noticed. I want equality. I don’t want to be treated like I’m not an American citizen.”“I’m not happy with Trump. When he visited Puerto Rico, he threw paper towels at us—I feel like he mocked us and disrespected us. He didn’t seem to care about all the people who died during the hurricane. As a president, he hasn’t been responsible and hasn’t manned up.”In 2018, Florida voters passed a ballot initiative, Amendment 4, that restored voting rights to 1.4 million residents who had previously been convicted of a felony. It looked like a milestone for voting rights: Almost 1 in 5 Black adults in the state was unable to vote. If even a portion of this population availed itself of the chance to vote, it could alter Florida election outcomes, perhaps decisively.But last year the Republican-led state legislature and Republican Governor Ron DeSantis teamed up to pass a bill undermining Amendment 4 by requiring ex-felons to repay all outstanding fines and judicial fees to be registered to vote. Estimates suggest 1 million ex-felons, who collectively owe about $1 billion, could be barred from voting unless they repay their fines (difficult to do, since no central state database tracks delinquent debts). Civil-rights groups called the new law an unconstitutional “poll tax” and sued to stop it. In May a U.S. district judge condemned Florida’s “pay-to-vote system” and ruled the state couldn’t prohibit ex-felons from voting. But in July a federal appeals court halted the group’s voter registration, granting DeSantis’s request, and weeks later the U.S. Supreme Court chose not to intervene.Despite Republican efforts, some ex-felons will still be able to vote this fall—although no one is sure how many will turn out. —Joshua Green“I actually have a voter registration card and was able to vote in a local election here several months ago, before the appeal happened. Then they took my voting rights away for a second time. I’m still trying to find out exactly how much I owe [in fines or fees]. It’s pay-for-play, pure politics.“We’re regular people. We’re not crazed maniacs. Yes, I did serve time. But I have a family, I’m a father, a son, a grandparent now. I’m just a regular person. I want to be regular again.”“I got my right to vote back when my sentence was overturned in 1998. My case is different than a lot of others: I never had any fines.“To vote means a lot to me because it’s saying that I have a voice, I have a say in what’s going on in this country. And I should. Since I got out, I’ve just been putting my head to something that’s legal and that’s right. But I’ll be honest, it’s been a struggle. Even the truck driving—I had a school tell me that nobody would hire me, being a convicted felon. But my mom taught me, ‘Always know how to sell yourself.’ I told the gentlemen, ‘You just give me the license, I’ll worry about the job.’ And I got hired the same day.”“Being honest with you, I don’t like either Biden or Trump. Biden signed the ’94 crime bill, which put a lot of people in jail. A lot of people did a lot of life sentences. Trump signed the Fair Sentencing Act, which released a lot of those people.\"If I’m able to vote, I have a say in what happens in what is going on in the world: how my taxes are spent, how the government functions, what they do and how it’s done. My vote is just one vote, but my one vote can change how the local school board or the sheriff’s department is run. I look to the examples of Congressman John Lewis and Martin Luther King Jr.: An obstacle is an opportunity.”(After this story appeared, Bloomberg Businessweek learned that in 2017 Naresh Vissa self-published a book called “Trumpbook: How Digital Liberals Silenced a Nation Into Making Americans Hate Again.” He should not have been included in the Shy Trumpers category.

       "  'Microsoft’s Game Pass is one of several subscriptions that keep revenue flowing no matter what.The Game Pass logo is displayed on monitors during Microsoft’s Xbox event ahead of the 2019 E3 Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles.On Aug. 11, Microsoft Corp. posted an alert on the Twitter account of its Halo franchise: The game’s next installment wouldn’t be ready this fall as originally planned, with its release delayed until 2021. A few years ago, that would have been devastating news for the team that makes the company’s Xbox game console, which had been planning to roll out a new model in tandem with Halo Infinite. But the Xbox will arrive as scheduled in November, and Microsoft is bullish about its prospects—even though Sony Corp.’s rival PlayStation 5 will also make its debut in the coming months, with what many players say is a stronger slate of games. Central to Microsoft’s optimism is a service called Game Pass, which offers a vast selection of titles for a flat monthly fee. “We’re confident,” says Sarah Bond, the vice president who oversees relations with game creators. “We will launch with thousands of games.”Game Pass and similar offerings from Apple, Google, Sony, and other software houses are changing the dynamics of the video game business. After spending hundreds of dollars on a game machine, users would typically have to lay out an additional $60 or so for any newly released A-list title they wanted to play. Now a subscription costing $5 to $15 per month will get them scores, or even hundreds, of games—including, in Microsoft’s case, hot titles on the day they’re released. Since Game Pass was introduced three years ago, Microsoft has signed up 10 million subscribers. Sony, which started its PlayStation Now service in 2014, has some 2.2 million customers, more than triple the number a year earlier after the price was cut in half, to $10 per month. “Subscriptions will play a big role in driving engagement,” says George Jijiashvili, an analyst at researcher Omdia.Subscriptions can keep revenue flowing even when a company has no new console or blockbuster title. Game Pass is available in 41 countries, and Microsoft is adding the ability to stream games to Android devices. This fall it’s tripling the number of countries where it sells what it calls All Access, which gives customers a new console and a Game Pass subscription for a monthly fee that’s currently $20 to $25, similar to cellphone contracts that periodically give you a new handset. The company says deals with Walmart Inc. and Target Corp. will help boost sales of All Access.Contrary to expectations, Bond says, monthly plans get customers to spend more. A Game Pass subscription leads to about 20% more playing time. Users sample a wider variety of genres, and they generate 20% more in sales, both on titles not included in the plan and on extras such as downloadable content. Game Pass helped increase revenue for Xbox content and services by 65% in the most recent quarter. “People make this assumption that if you have a subscription, you stop buying games,” Bond says, but the opposite is true.The risk for subscription providers is that game fans may tire of paying multiple monthly fees, much as TV fans are starting to wonder whether they really need Netflix and Hulu and Disney+ and HBO Max. But industry watchers say there’s plenty of room for growth because the games business lags video and music in converting buyers to subscribers. While subscriptions make up almost 90% of premium video revenue, Omdia says, they account for less than a fifth of the $53 billion in annual sales of console and PC games.Although Microsoft offers game makers an upfront payment and bonuses based on how well a title does, producers aren’t entirely enthusiastic. Many, particularly makers of smash-hit games, fret that subscription services will shake up the industry in the same way platforms such as Apple, Pandora, and Spotify changed music, taking the biggest slice of revenue. A survey by the Game Developers Conference found that almost three-fourths of developers fear subscriptions might hurt the value of individual games. Still, it’s a hit-driven business with myriad titles jockeying for attention, and even successful studios often worry about covering costs. For them, Game Pass can seem like a sure thing. “You get a good influx of cash as an advance,” says Dan Da Rocha, studio chief at Jaw Drop Games. “It’s a very good helping hand.”Simon Byron, publishing director of Curve Digital, a software house in London, says Game Pass has helped win new fans for his puzzle games, which aren’t typical console fare. Microsoft says 60% of people who played Curve’s Human: Fall Flat on Game Pass had never done puzzles before, and two-fifths of those bought a similar title after playing. While individual sales of the $15 game are comparable on Xbox and PlayStation, five times more customers have tried it on Game Pass, according to Byron. “We were genuinely nervous, but so far we’ve been really pleased,” he says. “Selfishly, the service is becoming so popular with other publishers that it’s become harder to put our titles there, but that’s a sign they’re doing something right.” — Video Game Boom Is Also Magnifying Industry’s Ongoing Problems\\n— Blockbuster Video Games Mint Millions While Grunts Get Exploited\\n— Video Game Numbers Show an Industry’s All-Out Growth'),\n",

They’ve plowed through Tiger King and the much-acclaimed production of Hamilton. Millions have even made time for game shows as low-brow as Floor is Lava (pretty much what it sounds like), which turned into a hit for Netflix Inc. At the peak in late March and early April, people in the U.S. were devouring in excess of 160 billion minutes of streaming video per week—the equivalent of about 8 hours per person, or twice what they had a year prior, when a trip to the cineplex didn’t run much risk of contracting a deadly virus.Against this backdrop, Blackstone Group Inc. decided to buy a 49% stake in three Hollywood studio lots. Hard times have always been a boon for escapist entertainment, but the Blackstone deal, which the company said was completed Aug. 3 and valued the properties at $1.65 billion, was a long-term bet on streaming. Even after the pandemic, companies such as Netflix, Amazon.com Inc., and Walt Disney Co. will need stages to feed the world’s bottomless appetite for video.2018Data: FilmLABlackstone and its partner, Hudson Pacific Properties Inc., are betting they can buy up more of the space in such key entertainment hubs as Vancouver, New York, and London in the coming years. “This is as strong a trend, as far as demand growth, as anything we see in the real estate business,” says Nadeem Meghji, the head of real estate for the Americas at Blackstone. “If you look at the data, we’ve seen an almost doubling of total content spend globally over the last three years.”Commercial real estate investors have been puzzling over where to invest during the pandemic. Hotels and retail space look dicey as the virus curtailstravel and trips to the mall. The future of offices is cloudy, too, as people telecommute from home. Even apartments, which have long been viewed as recession-resistant, are looking due for a couple of bad years with so many unemployed. That’s left elephant-hunting real estate investors such as Blackstone with a narrower set of options. Owning studios is “pretty niche,” says Danny Ismail, a senior analyst at Green Street Advisors. But “it checks many boxes that your average real estate investor would find very appealing.”Sound stages were seen for years as a ho-hum business for landlords. The norm in the industry was for production companies to sign short leases, because many shows got canceled after a season. But the rise of Netflix and other streaming services changed the equation. The new content creators wanted offices on-site and were willing to make longer-term commitments for space they could restage for show after show. The streaming wars have stoked demand, as binge-watchers expect a big menu of programs for their subscription. Meanwhile, very few new sound stages have been built, because it’s hard to find enough land for the airplane hangar-sized buildings in a city like L.A.Leading up to the pandemic, there was about a 1% vacancy for the space, according to broker Newmark Knight Frank. “Studios were able to pick and choose who they wanted on their lots, what kind of shows, what kind of terms,” says Jennifer Frisk, senior managing director with Newmark’s L.A. office. “The market was incredibly strong.” Even when the virus shut down production, landlords didn’t have to provide rent relief or deal with tenants leaving, she says. “Everyone’s keeping their space, with plans to pick back up as soon as they can.”The tight market is forcing producers to consider lower-quality space, including one formerly used by bankrupt retailer Forever 21, says Jeff Worthe, chairman of Worthe Real Estate Group, which has a partnership with Blackstone on offices and production facilities in Burbank. “People are going to make do with stuff they wouldn’t have filmed in two or three years ago,” he says.It’s all been a validation for a strategy that Hudson Pacific started pursuing more than a decade ago, when Netflix’s big business was still mailing DVDs in red envelopes. Starting in 2007, the real estate investment trust began buying up some of Hollywood’s historic lots, including one where the first “talkie” was shot. Series as varied as The Golden Girls and True Blood have filmed at the others. Hudson added “creative” offices to the properties, collectively called Sunset Studios, and leased space to tenants that included Netflix, CBS, and Disney.Victor Coleman, Hudson’s chief executive officer, began speaking with Blackstone President Jon Gray about a potential partnership late last year. Ultimately, Coleman says, he went with Blackstone in part because they had a shared commitment to be in the studio business for the long haul. The deal gives Hudson the capital to develop new office and production facilities. Blackstone is one of the deepest-pocketed investors in the world, with $46 billion in “dry powder”—cash committed by investors—to spend on real estate.Right now, though, there are some challenges to running studios. When California went into lockdown in March, filming halted. Even though production was allowed to resume in June, shows have been slow to restart as cast and crew figure out how to maintain social distancing while shooting fistfights and kisses. Even today, the lots look deserted. Hudson’s Sunset Bronson property, which contains Netflix’s main Hollywood office, has a billboard in the parking lot advertising “Spenser Confidential,” starring Mark Wahlberg. It debuted on March 6.Hudson Pacific makes additional money by providing services, such as lighting, grip, and control-room rentals, which can represent about a third of the revenue in normal times. A drop-off in filming caused income for that line item to plunge in the second quarter according to Coleman, even as the company’s studios collected nearly 100% of the rent.A further challenge for studio owners could be lower demand for on-site office space, says Laura Martin, an L.A.-based entertainment industry analyst for Needham & Co. After having everyone work from home for months, companies such as Netflix may decide that back-office legal and accounting jobs can continue remotely. “The longer Covid goes on, the more likely some of the traditional habits of making TV and film change,” Martin says. “And if they change, they’re more likely to be more distributed and less centralized on lot space.” Coleman is skeptical of a sea change. He says in-person collaboration will still be key for script writing, editing, set design, and other production jobs.There’s also a long-running trend in the film and TV business of moving production to lower-cost locales that have generous tax breaks. Content creators may choose to own some facilities, rather than lease. Netflix, for instance, bought a studio in 2018 in Albuquerque that it’s using as a U.S. production hub.Still, Martin thinks L.A. will retain its leading role, because that’s where the stars live. “The talent doesn’t want to sign up for a series that’s going to be in Wichita, Kansas, for 10 years,” she says. “Remember Hawaii? The Lost people were there for 10 years. Lots of complaints. People don’t even want to live in Hawaii for 10 years to do a series.”A widely anticipated shakeout among streaming players could also hurt demand over the long term. Right now, the space is crowded with companies that have billions of dollars to burn on new digital content, including Disney, Netflix, Amazon, and Apple Inc. But there are smaller players that could end up getting absorbed or shutting down.Which services make the cut won’t affect Blackstone’s bet much, says Meghji. “We’re really not taking a view on who the winner will be,” he says. “We’re taking a view on aggregate demand growth.” So far, the data are on his side. The Covid-19 bump for streaming video had subsided some by early June as the economy reopened, according to Nielsen. But it was still up about 50% from a year earlier.\\n \\nRead more: The Next Streaming Showdown Is a Race for Eyeballs in Southeast Asia'),\n",

       "  'Empty stands at Clemson Memorial Stadium in South Carolina.You almost feel sorry for Mark Packer and Wes Durham. The two veteran broadcasters have what might seem like dream jobs, chatting about college sports for two hours every morning for the Walt Disney Co.-owned ESPN empire. These days they air their show separately from their respective homes, and you can hear the frustration in their voices when yet another athletic league cancels its season or a high-profile school delays its start date because of the coronavirus.“We’ve talked about this almost ad nauseam,” Packer told his colleague after football powerhouse Clemson University said its students won’t return to campus until late September. If students aren’t even able to walk across a quad to class, “how can you have a football game, a baseball game, a tennis match, whatever it happens to be? That’s a very difficult question.”It’s one echoing throughout the ESPN operation these days. No major media company has bet more on college sports than ESPN. The company airs college games on 10 different channels, including the ABC broadcast network and its ESPN+ streaming service. It runs specific networks for the Southeastern and Atlantic Coast conferences and for the University of Texas. Last season more than half of all college football viewers tuned in to one of ESPN’s outlets.But this year the season is completely up in the air. Some conferences, including the Ivy League, have canceled fall sports entirely. The Pac-12 and Big Ten have eliminated games with schools outside of their conference, so they can limit travel and start their seasons later. That’s squashed popular matchups such as Ohio State vs. Oregon and Penn State vs. Virginia Tech.2019-20 seasonData: Standard Media IndexThe college crisis comes as ESPN is benefiting from the return of professional sports, after months of airing old games, Korean baseball, documentaries, and an Eagles concert. The National Basketball Association and Major League Soccer are even playing their Covid-shortened seasons at the company’s Wide World of Sports facility near Orlando.ESPN, which declined to make any of its executives available for this article, said the games canceled so far have mostly involved those on its online channels, or those coming from conferences shared with other broadcasters such as Fox Corp. So the lost games on ESPN could be fewer than it seems, it said. The network could also move up lesser matchups from its online outlets to run in place of canceled games.Still, many decisions about the upcoming season have yet to be made. Unlike the professional leagues, which have one central commissioner and a relatively small number of teams, control of college athletic schedules is spread out among dozens of schools, presidents, and conferences. “It’s harder to get consensus,” says Patrick Crakes, a former Fox Sports executive who’s now a consultant.College football accounted for about $793 million in advertising at ESPN, ABC, and their related networks, estimates Standard Media Index, which tracks advertising spending. That’s almost four times as much as their closest rival, Fox.Big sponsors including AT&T Inc., Dr Pepper, and State Farm depend on college football for billions of ad impressions a year, according to ISpot.tv. College GameDay, a program in which ESPN commentators travel from school to school each week, is a Saturday morning staple for many Americans. The network says it still plans to take that show on the road, though longtime host Lee Corso, who’s 84, may appear from his house. Home Depot Inc., the main sponsor, says it will continue to be involved and looks at this as an “opportunity to engage with college football fans in new virtual ways.”ESPN and other networks are doing their best to persuade advertisers to stick around, moving spots from one sport or channel to another, says Sam Bloom, chief executive officer of Camelot Strategic Marketing & Media, which helps companies including TurboTax, Whole Foods Market, and 7-Eleven make ad decisions. “For some of our advertisers, it’s forcing them to rethink,” he says.Chris Wujcik, vice president for client consulting and services at GMR Marketing in New Berlin, Wis., says sponsors are mostly in a wait-and-see position. If entire seasons are canceled, it will be difficult to find programs that reach audiences of a similar size. If top-tier games are replaced by less-followed matchups, the networks will probably offer their sponsors other perks such as digital ads or even signage in stadiums to compensate. “Everyone’s going to be really creative with what they offer,” says Wujcik, whose firm’s clients include Hershey Co. and Nissan Motor Co.The loss of postseason games, such as the Rose Bowl and Sugar Bowl, which accounted for about a combined $345 million in ad revenue last year for ESPN and ABC, would be painful. ESPN was scheduled to air 39 bowl matches. One, the Celebration Bowl, has already been canceled.The National Collegiate Athletic Association said it would resume discussions in August about whether some of its championships will still be played. “We all remain deeply concerned about the infection trend lines we see,” NCAA President Mark Emmert said in a statement on July 24.It’s not only college play that’s been disrupted. After losing two of the league’s 26 teams when players tested positive, Major League Soccer has continued to play in Orlando with no new cases since July 13. Major League Baseball, which is playing its games on the road, canceled several at the start of its season after players from the Miami Marlins tested positive.ESPN’s cable networks could see ad revenue fall this year by 12%, or $320 million, says Scott Robson, an analyst for S&P Global Market Intelligence. Much of that could come from college sports. “We’re going to see similar declines at the rest of the programmers in this quarter and the current quarter,” he says. “It’s a big deal.”With a loss of revenue such as that, ESPN, which coped this year in part by furloughing workers and asking on-air talent to take 15% pay cuts, may resort to layoffs, Crakes says. Throughout the pandemic, cable TV companies have continued to collect monthly bills from customers and remit programming fees to the sports networks, even though live sports have been off the air. If ESPN and its sister channels can’t deliver the contracted hours of live sports, cable operators could ask for some of that money back. Worse, cable customers, fed up with high monthly fees, may downsize to lower-priced TV packages or cancel service entirely. Those pay-TV subscriber fees are a big number for Disney: almost $10 billion from ESPN-related channels alone last year, or three times what its networks bring in from advertising. A recent UBS Securities survey found 14% of cable subscribers would likely cancel the service if college football didn’t happen.“This could accelerate cord-cutting,” says Doug Perlman, who consults with leagues over media deals at his company, Sports Media Advisors LLC. “There will be more people who say, ‘There’s no college football. It’s time for me to move on.’\\u200a” —With Lucas Shaw'),\n",

       "  'As Japan’s biggest comic in a decade nears its end, publishers and streaming giants are hungry for a new monster hit.One day last July, Hajime Isayama spent a morning strolling through a chic modern art gallery on the 52nd floor of the Mori Tower, which looms over Tokyo’s upscale Roppongi neighborhood. The gallery walls, which have since been adorned with paintings by Jean-Michel Basquiat, were lined with original artwork from the manuscript pages for a bestselling manga, or comic book, Isayama’s Shingeki no Kyojin (Attack on Titan).The exhibition commemorated the 10th anniversary of this gory epic, which is set in a world dominated by flayed, vascular, man-eating behemoths, tall as the Mori Tower itself, who terrorize walled-off cities where humanity has taken refuge. In the decade since Titan was first printed in Bessatsu Shonen Magazine, its antagonists have left their gigantic footprints all over Japan’s popular culture. The country’s largest publisher, Kodansha Ltd., has issued about 100 million copies of its 31 serialized volumes. The animated television adaptation is an international hit that has in turn generated a live-action film franchise, several video games, and merchandise including toys, tote bags, and limited-edition packaging for a popular Japanese laundry detergent.At the exhibition, Isayama draped his wiry frame in a plain hooded sweatshirt, and he wore a medical mask to disguise himself from the fans who’ve made him by far the most successful manga artist of his generation. But the mask only accentuated his distinctive hair, which hangs down the sides of his face like angular black drapes. At 33, he’s achieved a level of fame at home that would be unfathomable for a comic book artist in America. Practically everyone in Japan reads comics, whether serialized in weekly or monthly manga magazines such as Shonen Jump or collected in volumes called tankobon. The artists, who typically both illustrate and write, are venerated as auteurs.Isayama peered over the shoulders of the high school students, housewives, and salarymen attending the exhibition, drinking in their unfiltered chatter. The conversations weren’t unlike the fan discourse surrounding Game of Thrones, in their focus on plot twists, shocking deaths, and gruesome set pieces. The two works share a particular tendency to kill off their protagonists. Both have also, at their heights, been industries unto themselves.“Back when the series first got picked up, there were constant news reports that Kodansha was seriously in the red,” Isayama said. “I had no idea how long any of this was going to last.” Instead of becoming a casualty of Kodansha’s financial woes, though, Attack on Titan turned out to be the publisher’s answer. When an animated TV adaptation was introduced in 2013, sales of the comic soared, lifting Kodansha’s sales for the first time in 18 years and returning it to profitability.A comic this successful might be expected to run for 100 volumes or more—one of Isayama’s favorites as a child was JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure, which came out the year he was born and remains in print as its creator, Hirohiko Araki, periodically reinvents his protagonist. Isayama, though, has decided he’s run out of story to tell. His manga and anime TV series will complete their final story arc sometime in the coming year.Kodansha will be left with a very large financial hole to fill. Attack on Titan has for years insulated the publisher against industry trends that it will have to confront head-on. Domestic revenue from sales of print manga volumes, which comprise almost half of Japan’s $12 billion-a-year book market, plunged to an all-time low in 2017 and fell a further 5% in 2018, according to Japan’s National Publishers Association. (Revenue jumped 5% in the first half of 2019, the most recent period for which figures are available, but only because of an industrywide price hike.) Sales of digital comics have been an exception, climbing steadily in recent years and getting a boost this spring, when many Japanese bookstores were closed to halt the spread of Covid-19. But rampant piracy and lower prices make digital manga less profitable than traditional paper comics.Data: OriconThe pressure on Kodansha is all the more intense because it coincides with a moment of great opportunity. Demand for adaptation-friendly storylines is higher than ever, the result of a fierce fight between Netflix Inc. and Hulu LLC to become global leaders in anime streaming. In 2017, Netflix shook up the industry by luring Taiki Sakurai away from Production I.G Inc., the studio responsible for one of the most successful animes of all-time, Ghost in the Shell. Sakurai’s first Netflix series was Devilman Crybaby, based on Kodansha’s surrealist manga Devilman, from 1972.But Kodansha and its rivals must do more than simply mine their back catalogs if they’re to thrive. Japanese manga publishers receive only a modest share of licensing income, so for them anime serves primarily as comic book ads. Unlike Marvel and DC, which retain great control over the worlds their company artists and writers invent, Japanese comics publishers work in a system that defers to the creator.“The author has almost absolute control in Japan,” says Jason DeMarco, who’s been licensing anime for Turner Broadcasting System Inc.-owned Cartoon Network Inc. for more than two decades. “That’s totally different from U.S. publishing, where it’s like, ‘Thanks for creating Spider-Man—now get the f--- out of here, so we can make a lot of money off of Spider-Man.’\\u2009”\\n When I met Isayama at Kodansha’s Tokyo headquarters in January, the deference accorded to successful manga creators was evident: The artist, who works from an apartment near his home, was greeted with deep bows and bags filled with gifts. Erika Kato, a licensing manager in the international rights department, thanked him profusely for agreeing to be interviewed, which he rarely does these days. Isayama was dressed casually, in blue jeans and a hoodie, like a man who works from home. His sleepy countenance and frequent yawns suggested he was doing little else there.On my way to the interview, I’d picked up a copy of Isayama’s most recent tankobon, whose cover advertised a forthcoming Attack on Titan ride at Universal Studios Japan. Kodansha had helped arrange a string of licensing and advertising partnerships to help end the series with a bang. Each of these—including the Mori Tower exhibition, which generated about $2.5 million in ticket sales—depended on Isayama’s approval. “These kinds of commercial opportunities aren’t going to last forever, so I don’t turn my back on them,” he said. “It’s nice to think that the world of Attack on Titan will continue on just a little bit longer.”He was keenly aware that he was securing his artistic legacy, too. “I was a big fan of Game of Thrones, so I can relate to the feelings of those fans who were disappointed with how the series ended,” he said. “But when I’m drawing, I’m expressing my own feelings, and I think as long as I’m doing that, my fans will be able to accept whatever ending I come up with for them.” He’s already decided how the narrative will conclude, but knowing where he’s headed hasn’t saved him from agonizing at times over how to get there. Attack on Titan is a multifaceted epic, with dozens of characters wrapped up in intersecting plotlines. Competing mythologies and histories, and even alternate dimensions, complicate a text marked by political, strategic, and social intrigue and themes of betrayal, revenge, and resurrection.Kodansha’s finances and identity depend on having at least one tentpole blockbuster series aimed at adults. Its two biggest rivals rely on slightly different models: Shogakukan Inc. supplements its original titles by licensing popular video game characters such as Nintendo Co.-owned Pikachu, of Pokémon fame, and Sega’s Sonic the Hedgehog, for children’s comics. Shueisha Inc. focuses on original youth-oriented hits, such as Dragon Ball, One Piece, and My Hero Academia.Kodansha’s approach traces to the 1980 introduction of Young Magazine, a biweekly packed with about 300 pages of serialized comics. The books were aimed at young adult men, who were increasingly flush with disposable income as Japan entered an economic bubble. In 1982, Young began publishing Katsuhiro Otomo’s cyberpunk classic Akira, which chronicles a violent confrontation between psychics, biker gangs, and the military in a post-apocalyptic “neo-Tokyo” of 2019. The magazine’s circulation soon surged to more than a million readers, prompting Kodansha to start issuing standalone Akira tankobon. When the series wrapped up in 1990, its six volumes collectively formed a graphic novel of more than 2,000 pages; millions of copies have sold worldwide. The film adaptation brought in $49 million in global box office receipts and an additional $30 million in VHS sales after its 1988 theatrical release and became one of the most influential science fiction films of all time.One of the people influenced by Akira was Masamune Shiro, who would prove to be Kodansha’s next wunderkind. His seminal manga, Ghost in the Shell, was serialized in Young Magazine from early 1989 to late 1990, and it, too, got its own tankobon, anime film, and English-language edition. Groundbreaking, commercially successful comics come along only so often, though, and Kodansha hit a dry spell just as Japan’s bubble years came to an end. By 2002 the company’s sales had fallen low enough to drag it into the red for the first time since World War II.The Isayama era began before the decade was out, but here Kodansha was lucky: Attack on Titan came to the publisher only after Shueisha passed. In 2006, Isayama called Kodansha to request a meeting, reaching an editor named Shintaro Kawakubo. He saw enough potential in Isayama that he gave the fledgling artist homework assignments to improve his illustration skills. “I asked him to practice redrawing action sequences from Hajime no Ippo,” Kawakubo says, referring to a popular boxing manga. “And since he wasn’t good at drawing clean lines, I had him redraw scenes from romance manga.”As a storyteller, though, Isayama was a natural. The comic seemed, at a glance, to be a niche story, with a unique setting that would appeal to “comic book geeks,” Kawakubo says. But “looking deeper, it had all the makings of a mainstream hit.” More than most artists, Isayama seemed able—and willing—to view his characters from a marketing perspective as well as an artistic one. He knew how to leave readers wanting more—how to keep them coming back issue after issue with plot twists and cliffhangers, almost as though he was writing for TV.Kawakubo traces this sensibility to Isayama’s move to Tokyo from rural Oita prefecture. “He thought deeply about what readers wanted from him, because failing to deliver would mean returning to work a day job until his next series came along,” Kawakubo says. “Because of that mindset, he’s become an author who is capable of thinking like a manga editor or an anime producer.”In 1996, DeMarco and Sean Akins, two creative directors at the Cartoon Network, were charged with filling a new block of after-school programming. They came up with Toonami, a four-hour show that reflected their off-kilter tastes. It mixed Hanna-Barbera cartoons such as Birdman with older anime like Voltron and Robotech, which could be licensed for virtually nothing—more or less the budget DeMarco and Akins set out with. After Toonami did well in its first months, their boss tossed them some pocket money for more anime.“Dragon Ball Z was one we knew about, because we had watched bootleg VHS tapes that we rented from a Japanese home video store here in Atlanta,” DeMarco said when we met at the Georgia offices of Adult Swim, Cartoon Network’s late-night programming block. When they added it to their lineup in 1998, major distributors such as Bandai Co. and Funimation Productions LLC started coming to him with pitches for other shows. Eventually Toonami moved to Adult Swim, where it introduced American viewers to iconic manga characters such as Sailor Moon before dwindling ratings led to its cancellation in 2008.DeMarco is now vice president and creative director of Adult Swim. Sitting in a conference room named for Astro Boy, wearing jeans and a black T-shirt with a faded image from a horror manga by Junji Ito, he looked like a linebacker who’d gone on vacation in Japan and never come home. He told me about the Cartoon Network’s decision to bring back Toonami in 2012. The revival began as a one-time April Fool’s Day nostalgia trip for die-hard fans, but when it got tremendous ratings and social media attention, DeMarco decided to make it permanent.To fill the block he turned to his contacts at Funimation, who showed him a teaser trailer for the Attack on Titan anime it was seeking to distribute. “It was literally just an image of the titan coming over the wall,” DeMarco told me. “When we saw that we were, like, ‘Hell yeah!’ We didn’t even read the comic, we just said, ‘Yeah, we’re interested in this.’ I’m a big horror fan, and the idea of a skinless, giant humanoid eating people—you don’t have to work hard to sell me on that.”Toonami began including Attack on Titan in May 2014, seven months after the first season concluded in Japan. It was an immediate hit, bringing in about 1.3 million viewers in its midnight time slot. “You’re talking about a crazy Japanese show that’s drawing as big an audience as Family Guy, which is one of the biggest hit cartoons in the U.S. in the last 20 years,” DeMarco said. “That’s about as mainstream as anime can get in the U.S.”The show’s success helped tilt the U.S.’s entire comic book market to the East. From 2015 to 2018, Barnes & Noble Inc. doubled the shelf space it devoted to manga and began holding “Manga Mondays” sales events. That helped Attack on Titan, which had fewer than a million English-language copies in print at the end of 2014, approximately triple its print run within a year. Some 4 million copies have now been issued, plus almost 1 million downloads of the digital edition. The windfall caught everyone involved with the show off guard. They hadn’t planned for another season, leaving fans to wait until 2017 for another.Around the time the anime returned, Netflix Japan dropped what DeMarco calls a “money bomb” on the market. Netflix hasn’t said exactly how much cash it invested, but its chief content officer, Ted Sarandos, told analysts late that year that it planned to spend a significant chunk of its $8 billion original-content budget on anime. Greg Peters, Netflix’s chief product officer, attributes the company’s interest in part to how well anime works with streaming technology: “If you take something like anime, which is superefficient from an encoding perspective, we can now provide an amazing quality video experience for anime titles on mobile.” This mobile-friendliness dovetails neatly with the genre’s target market.Netflix’s hunt has taken a two-pronged approach. One is the old-fashioned route of forging partnerships with production companies and acquiring licenses, including one for a reboot of Kodansha’s Ghost in the Shell. The other is producing its own anime in-house; Netflix’s first original anime series, Eden, is scheduled to premiere before the end of the year.The second path is tremendously risky for producers, however. Original anime films of the kind done by Hayao Miyazaki (Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away) can take years and tens of millions of dollars to produce, and they come without the built-in audience of a successful manga. Nao Azuma, a spokeswoman for Netflix Japan, says finding talent also has been a challenge. “It’s a very new type of platform and so it takes convincing,” she says. “We’re hoping that the content we’re producing is inspirational for creators and gives them some sense of what’s possible here.”For now, the incentives favor licensing. Walt Disney Co.-owned Hulu is also in the game, armed with an exclusive first-look partnership with Funimation that gives it access to all the most important players in anime. The result has been to push up the price for everyone hoping to acquire manga properties.DeMarco says all this activity is a good thing for creators—and by extension publishers—even if it’s made his job harder. He’s been trying to innovate; for one recent deal, he skipped the middleman and went directly to Shogakukan to acquire the rights to Uzumaki, a manga by Junji Ito about a town cursed by spiral shapes (found on boys who’ve transformed into snails and women whose hair has come alive). Adult Swim agreed to fund the project from scratch. DeMarco describes it as more of a labor of love than a paradigm shift. Producing original anime takes so much time, he says, “that we’d have to shut down for three years in order to have enough shows ready to fill a whole Toonami block.” It was worth it to DeMarco this time, though, if only for the chance to work with a manga artist he reveres.Manga publishers, for their part, are mindful that there are limits to how much they can rely on anime. Two editors I spoke with at a Kodansha rival, who requested anonymity discussing confidential business arrangements, pointed out that these deals aren’t necessarily a dependable source of revenue. “In the end, the pie gets sliced up so many ways that a publisher might get nothing out of it aside from a boost in comic book sales,” one said.If anime is driving Kodansha as it hunts for the next Attack on Titan, Kawakubo, who’s charged with leading the search, isn’t letting on. The process he describes for recruiting new talent remains basically unchanged after decades: Editors seek out published artists whose work they like, as well as newcomers scouted at Japan’s manga trade schools or in contests the company holds, and try to foster great work.A hit comic, Kawakubo says, can’t be engineered—“the magic is either there or it isn’t.” It starts the way Titan did, with telling a good story. “If you make a manga that’s not worth reading, no one will want to make it into an anime series,” he says. “And if you’re focused from the start on what might make a good anime, or what the next trend might be, you’ll never make anything worthwhile.”\\n in the spring of 2018, I met with Shinzo Keigo at a coffeehouse in the west Tokyo suburbs, not far from Studio Ghibli, the shop where Miyazaki has been producing masterpieces since 1985. Like Isayama, Keigo is 33, but his path to becoming a professional manga artist was more typical. Starting in 2008 he published seven comics with Shogakukan, including a few indie hits that were made into films or TV programs. It was creatively fulfilling, but yeoman’s work for a modest wage.I’d first spoken with Keigo a few weeks before, as he was promoting a live-action TV show based on his most recent work for Shogakukan, Tokyo Alien Brothers, which chronicles the adventures of two slacker extraterrestrials sent to investigate life on Earth. It was envisioned, he told me over coffee, as a kind of “reverse version of the Christopher Nolan film Interstellar,” and it sold well enough across three standalone volumes to catch the attention of producers at Nippon Television Network Corp., which aired a live-action adaptation of the manga in the summer of 2018.Keigo was doing well enough at Shogakukan that he might have carved out a long career there, producing respected, adaptable hits that complemented to the company’s robust Pikachu business. But shortly after we met, he announced that Kodansha would publish his next series, Nora and the Weeds, about a police detective and a mysterious girl who reminds him of his dead daughter. “Working with Shogakukan was nice,” Keigo told me the next time I saw him. “But Kodansha is the kind of place you dream of being as a manga artist.”After landing at one of the company’s second-tier magazines, he’s gone on to do well, publishing a few Nora and the Weeds tankobon and selling the translation rights to a publisher in France, where he has a following. Still, he didn’t have any illusions of becoming the next Isayama.Then again, Isayama never imagined such a thing when he began drawing Attack on Titan while working a part-time job at an internet cafe. And although he’s giving up his series now, he isn’t necessarily giving up his stature. The next Hajime Isayama could well be Hajime Isayama. “I’ve actually floated about five different ideas for new serialized manga, but so far they’ve come to nothing,” he said. “I think I’d like to try doing a more realistic manga, but I haven’t yet been able to produce a manuscript that’s up to my own standards.”\\n \\nRead more: The Next Streaming Showdown Is a Race for Eyeballs in Southeast Asia '),\n",

       "  'Tencent and IQiyi face off against Netflix and Disney.As streaming has transformed much of the world’s media landscape, most of the competition has been between Western outfits vying to conquer the big video markets of the U.S., Europe, Latin America, and India. But now two of China’s largest online video companies, Tencent and IQiyi, are expanding across much of Southeast Asia, setting up the first real battle between Chinese streaming giants and their Western counterparts, Netflix and Disney.In early June, IQiyi Inc., in which Baidu Inc. owns a controlling stake, hired away Kuek Yu-Chuang, Netflix’s main liaison to governments in Southeast Asia. A couple of weeks later, Tencent Holdings Ltd. acquired IFlix Ltd., a video service in the region. Both companies have recently ramped up efforts to produce and license local content and are looking to add staff in markets including Thailand, Indonesia, and the Philippines.Minutes streamed, Q1 2020Data: Media Partners AsiaFor both Tencent Video and IQiyi, the growing investment in Southeast Asia marks the companies’ most significant expansion outside China. Neither Netflix Inc. nor Disney+ operates there because of the country’s strict rules governing foreign ownership of media. So Southeast Asia will be the first real battleground in the growing Sino-U.S. tug of war over who controls global storytelling.Tencent declined to comment for this story, but it said its acquisition of IFlix is part of its plan to expand WeTV, its international streaming service, across Southeast Asia. In a statement, IQiyi noted it was committed “to serving users of different markets.”The Chinese streaming services are entering the fray before any company has established a dominant position in the region. Netflix, the leading streaming service globally, has yet to surpass 1 million subscribers in any country in Southeast Asia, according to consultant Media Partners Asia. Walt Disney Co.—which is Netflix’s biggest competitor in the U.S.—is planning to roll out Disney+ in Southeast Asia before the end of the year, according to a person familiar with the matter. “The Chinese companies are seeing an opening,” says Vivek Couto, who runs Media Partners Asia. “It’s neutral territory.”Still, Southeast Asia presents a challenge for any global entertainment company. Outside a couple of pockets of affluence such as Singapore, most people in the region earn an average of less than $10,000 a year. And Indonesia, the area’s most populous nation, is home to hundreds of different languages and is one of several countries where the government imposes strict censorship rules. Before Kuek left Netflix, his primary focus was helping the streaming giant navigate such diplomatic challenges. He will serve a similar role at IQiyi, which first expanded overseas in June 2019.The difficulty is evident in the story of IFlix. In 2015 entrepreneurs Mark Britt and Patrick Grove formed the service offering second-run Hollywood movies and local programs for about $3 a month, a fraction of the price of Netflix. They thought the price—and regional know-how—would win them customers while Netflix struggled.In the years that followed, as Netflix attempted to expand in Southeast Asia, it ran into many of the problems that the IFlix co-founders had anticipated. Netflix was considered too expensive for many potential customers in the region, didn’t offer subtitles in many of the local languages, and wasn’t producing a lot of original programs for the area. The company also failed to strike a deal with Telkomsel, the largest telecommunications company in Indonesia. As a result, for the last four years, millions of people have had to skirt local restrictions by using virtual private networks to access Netflix. (The two sides just reached an agreement this year.) By contrast, IFlix has a deal with Telkomsel that allows locals to watch it legally.Even so, IFlix failed to get much traction. In a region where traditional pay-TV services cost next to nothing and YouTube is ubiquitous, persuading people to pay for a streaming video service is a challenge, even at a low price. IFlix’s acquisition by Tencent “is not really a deal,” says Couto. “It’s a distressed-asset sale.”There are signs the market for streaming services may be improving. Viu, owned by Hong Kong telecommunications giant PCCW Ltd., has had some success with a hybrid model, offering some programming for free on an advertising-supported service but charging customers who want a full range of shows and no ads.Viu first gained a following by licensing shows from South Korea, which are popular across all of Asia. Subscriptions are growing 50% to 60% a year in most of its markets and account for half the company’s sales, according to Janice Lee, Viu’s chief executive officer. In Indonesia, people are spending more time watching Viu than Netflix or IFlix. Lee credited original series such as My Bubble Tea, a Thai drama, and an Indonesian version of the series Pretty Little Liars. “It’s doing phenomenally,” she says.Recently, Netflix has started to attract more customers by selling cheaper, mobile-only plans and by producing a greater amount of local content. It now has about 800,000 subscribers in the Philippines, where it’s the clear market leader, and close to 600,000 customers in Thailand, where it’s second to Line TV, a local service. “Netflix has gone to the races, particularly in the last six months,” Couto says. “Consumption of Netflix in a lot of these markets is through the roof.”Chinese technology is already part of everyday life in many Southeast Asian countries. Chinese manufacturers dominate the smartphone market, while TikTok, the short-form video app owned by the Chinese company ByteDance Ltd., is ubiquitous. But Chinese video services have yet to achieve similar popularity. Unlike TikTok, which relies solely on user-generated programming, IQiyi and Tencent Video offer catalogs of TV shows and movies. To challenge Netflix and Disney, which provide huge amounts of content from the U.S. and Europe, the Chinese companies will likely need to invest heavily in local programming and license top shows from Korea and China.Most of the programming on IQiyi today is in Mandarin. The company is building an original production team in Thailand and has teamed with leading media and telecommunications companies in Malaysia and Myanmar. Viewers can now watch subtitled shows in English, Thai, Malay, Indonesian, and Vietnamese.Historically, Chinese media companies haven’t looked to expand much internationally. Tencent, IQiyi, and a third service, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s Youku, have focused on China, where each has spent heavily to compete for the next hit show. According to Reuters, Tencent has expressed interest in acquiring IQiyi, which lost $1.5 billion in 2019, to consolidate its control.But in recent years, the idea of using entertainment to influence the outside world has grown more appealing to the Chinese government, analysts say. “China’s top leaders feel that their country can provide a model not only for economic development but also for political and cultural leadership,” according to a recent note from Gavekal Fathom China, a research company focused on Chinese industry. “That sense has strengthened during the Covid-19 pandemic.”\\n \\nRead next: HBO Max Has Yet to Entice Key Group: People Who Already Have HBO'),\n",

       "  'The service says 85 million people saw Spenser Confidential. If action movies can work outside the theater, can everything else?The many screens of Spenser Confidential.Illustration: 731; Devices: Alamy; Wahlberg and Duke: Netflix While putting the finishing touches on his latest movie, Spenser Confidential, director Peter Berg worried viewers wouldn’t laugh. The film, an action-comedy modeled after Lethal Weapon and Die Hard, relies on humor to break the tension between explosions and firefights. The movie had thrilled audiences in test screenings. A theater packed with 300 people gave it an average score of 96—the highest of his career. But Spenser Confidential wasn’t going to appear in theaters. It would be available exclusively on Netflix, the world’s most popular paid streaming service.This is new ground for Berg, the 56-year-old filmmaker behind Hancock and Lone Survivor. In the past two decades he’s directed 11 movies that have collectively grossed more than $1.5 billion at the box office. He attributes their success to the power of a shared experience. When people cried during Patriots Day or Friday Night Lights, their emotion affected everyone in the theater. “I don’t know how those experiences play out when people watch them by themselves, or on a TV or a computer,” Berg says from his home in Los Angeles.Regardless of the experience, the impact surprised him. Not long after Spenser Confidential premiered on March 6, fans sent him direct messages on social media sharing their favorite moments, and friends texted congratulations. Berg has been wearing a mask in public during the pandemic, but that didn’t stop strangers from approaching him whenever he left his house. The volume of inbound messages grew by the day. Based on his unscientific gauge, he felt like he had a hit on his hands. Maybe his biggest ever.In April, Netflix Inc. said 85 million households watched Spenser Confidential in the first four weeks after its release, the third-largest film opening in company history. In comparison, about 76 million tickets were purchased to see 2018’s Black Panther during its entire run in theaters in North America.While rivals scoff at Netflix’s metric, which counts anyone who watches at least two minutes, it’s clear the company is satisfied. Berg and star Mark Wahlberg have signed on for a sequel, drawing again from Robert Parker’s bestselling novels.Spenser Confidential marked the start of the first summer season in history when all of the biggest blockbusters have opened online. With theaters shut down around the world, Netflix has released more than 30 movies since mid‑March, drawing huge “crowds” with another action film, Extraction, starring Chris Hemsworth, as well as the comedy The Wrong Missy. Extraction has been viewed by more than 100 million households; The Wrong Missy, more than 60 million. Rival studios, meanwhile, have shifted movies once destined for theaters to their own streaming services or online rental, releasing Trolls World Tour, Hamilton, and The King of Staten Island that way.Theater chains have dismissed this year as a one-off phenomenon because of the global pandemic. Studios are still eager to release big blockbusters such as the live-action Mulan and the new James Bond film in theaters. Christopher Nolan, the director of Inception and The Dark Knight, hopes to use his movie Tenet to reopen theaters in August. (Warner Bros. has already pushed back the release date twice.)Read more: These Are Netflix’s 10 Most Popular Original MoviesYet with each streaming hit, many filmmakers and Hollywood executives are starting to believe this year has provided a glimpse into the future.“We’re living in a radically different time in terms of how people appreciate viewing content; whether that’s good or bad, I don’t know. It’s just a real thing,” Berg says. “There are people who’ve watched Spenser on their phones, on their iPads, on their computers, and on their TVs. For them it’s been very satisfying.” Once adamant that his movies play on the big screen, Berg observes that missing out on theaters this time “didn’t really feel that relevant to me.” He’s working on two more projects with Netflix, including a scripted series about the Sackler family behind opioid maker Purdue Pharma LP.“We’re living in a radically different time”It wasn’t long ago that a director like Berg would have dismissed Netflix out of hand. Most filmmakers were initially reluctant to make movies for the internet, which felt like making a TV movie. ( That’s not a good thing.) When given the choice between Netflix and another studio, they typically pick the path that involves the widest release in theaters. The preference is both artistic and financial. Filmmakers want to see their work on the biggest screen possible—and they can make more money if they do. Robert Downey Jr. made $20 million upfront for Avengers: Endgame, according to Deadline, and $55 million more from his share of the profits. While Netflix might offer Downey more upfront for a movie, it doesn’t pay any money on the back end.But in the past few years, filmmakers have had a harder time getting anything made through the traditional system. Hooked on the profitability of comic book movies and sequels, major studios have closed their independent divisions and, save for Oscar season, all but given up on the midbudget drama.Percentage of film ticket sales, by genre, since 2000Source: The NumbersEven comedies have become a scarce commodity—the genre’s share of annual ticket sales has plunged more than 50% since 2013, according to the movie-business data site the Numbers. All 10 of the highest-grossing films in the world last year were either comic book movies, sequels, or remakes—and only one of them was set in anything approaching the real world. (It was Joker.) “Outside of Marvel and Star Wars, it’s becoming harder to get people in the cinema unless it’s a big event,” says Hemsworth, known to millions as Thor.This created an opportunity for Netflix, which has been happy to make the movies other studios have forsaken. Its first original projects were low-budget, independent films, the kinds that premiere at festivals such as Sundance and Toronto. The service then expanded into comedies, both sophomoric (Adam Sandler’s The Ridiculous 6) and romantic (To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before), before tackling serious drama with Alfonso Cuarón’s Roma and Martin Scorsese’s The Irishman—and giving filmmakers the kind of creative freedom they relish. Last year the company earned the most Oscar nominations of any studio, the first time a streaming service had done that. The list of movie stars and filmmakers working with Netflix this year includes George Clooney, David Fincher, Ron Howard, Meryl Streep, and Charlize Theron.“It’s one of the first places I’ve pitched things where studios might say, ‘It’s too much for us,’ and [Netflix] says, ‘Give us more,’\\u2009” says Theron, who stars in The Old Guard. Based on a graphic novel about a team of immortal mercenaries, the movie was released to generally positive reviews on July 10. Once scheduled in between Minions: The Rise of Gru and Tenet, it now has the first half of July to itself. (Well, it’s one of about 60 new films, shows, and specials to be released by Netflix this month. But most of the service’s myriad projects aren’t aimed for huge audiences or awards prestige.)The trio of Spenser Confidential, Extraction, and The Old Guard is a watershed moment for Hollywood. Action movies anchored by stars usually rule the summer box office, having turned Tom Cruise, Will Smith, and Bruce Willis into global celebrities. Now it’s the latest genre people expect to watch at home. “Those big-movie-star, big-actor-driven projects have really been hitting home,” says Scott Stuber, the head of Netflix’s film division. “Action is something we needed to move into as a big global company.”The breadth of films available at home keeps growing, and it seems clear this summer will accelerate a trend years in the making. Moviegoing in the U.S. and Canada sank to a 92-year low in 2019, when people averaged fewer than four films a year. Unwilling to surrender the other 48 weekends to Netflix, rivals Disney, Comcast, and AT&T have conceived slates of movies for their respective streaming services Disney+, Peacock, and HBO Max. Walt Disney Co. is making the sports drama Safety and the family drama Clouds, and HBO Max has filmed movies starring Streep and Seth Rogen.The longer theaters stay closed, the more studios experiment with models, and the more customers get used to seeing new movies at home. ViacomCBS Inc., which previously sold many projects to Netflix, pulled its latest SpongeBob Squarepants movie from theaters and will release it for online rental before putting it on its streaming service, CBS All Access. Warner Bros. employed a similar strategy with Scoob!, which is on HBO Max. (AT&T Inc. owns both HBO and Warner Bros.) Comcast Corp.’s Universal Pictures has been the most aggressive in collapsing the lag time between when a movie appears in theaters and is available at home, and its success with Trolls World Tour and The King of Staten Island has convinced its leadership that this model is here to stay.Not every filmmaker will embrace streaming. Nolan has said he will never work with Netflix, and Scorsese chose to stick with a more traditional release for his next project. Studios remain committed to giving their biggest movies a long run in theaters, and not just because theaters have threatened them if they don’t. They can still make more money with certain projects from a full run in theaters. Avengers: Endgame earned $900 million for Disney, making it last year’s most profitable film. Netflix didn’t make that much as an entire company in any quarter of 2019.But the number of movies that require a full three-month run in theaters is dwindling.“Why do we make movies? We make it for an audience,” says Gina Prince-Bythewood, director of The Old Guard. Like Berg, Prince-Bythewood was reluctant to work with Netflix at first. She wanted to see her movie on the big screen.But she changed her mind when she considered the opportunity in front of her. Throughout her career, she’s been told that people outside the U.S. don’t want to see movies with Black stars. Two of her three previous films didn’t even get a proper international release, and the third, The Secret Life of Bees, made 95% of its money in North America. Netflix released The Old Guard in more than 190 countries on the same day. “Ultimately,” she says, “you want the biggest audience to see the work.”'),\n",

       "  'In trying to bury conspiracy theories, a cable news powerhouse was handed a loudspeaker.The News Corp. headquarters, home to Fox News, in New York City.If you’ve watched a YouTube Inc. clip recently about Bill Gates’ secret pandemic ploy or the dangers of anti-fascist protest movement Antifa, chances are YouTube queued another video for you in the “Up Next” column from a familiar name—Fox News.In January 2019, the site, run by Alphabet Inc.’s Google, made a very big change to address its very real misinformation problem. It recognized that some corners were being overrun with conspiracy theories. Algorithms were feeding viewers similar content and YouTube wanted to pull in recommendations from a broader library. As a fix, it rewired its system to promote more “authoritative news” — the sorts of stories from old-school TV stations YouTube once promised to unseat. But by doing so, YouTube accidentally gave America’s top conservative-leaning cable network prime billing.Since early last year, Fox News has overtaken rivals CNN and MSNBC in viewership on the site. Over the past 12 months, views of Fox News videos on YouTube more than doubled to touch 245 million in June, according to data from research firm Social Blade. Another research firm, Socialbakers, lists Fox News as the most viewed U.S. news channel on YouTube during the first three weeks of June. A similar trend is unfolding on Facebook Inc., which rejigged its system along related lines in 2018. Fox News consistently tops Facebook’s charts of publishers with the most likes, comments and shares. According to Gabriel Kahn, a journalism professor at USC Annenberg, the “virtuous circle these platforms tried to create ended up benefiting a notoriously irresponsible news provider.”Growth in YouTube views over the period*YouTube implemented an algorithmic change aimed at promoting what it called \"authoritative sources\" in January 2019.Data: Social BladeYouTube says it began to surface more media outlets on its site starting in 2017 and that news channels overall flourished this year. One metric the company uses is a channel’s growth rate — specifically, what percentage of average daily views the YouTube account added. By that measure, the YouTube pages of MSNBC, NBC News and CNN all grew more than Fox over the past 12 months, according to YouTube. It declined to share those exact rates, or view counts.  Facebook declined to comment. Millions of Americans, particularly young people, get their news online. For years, Silicon Valley’s biggest tech companies have faced accusations that their systems for sorting and surfacing news is biased against conservatives. YouTube and Facebook, fearing that label, have made an effort to embrace right-leaning news outlets, keeping them in their stables of acceptable publishers. Fox News, a long-time favorite of President Trump, has been a beneficiary of that.Yet Fox News “traffics in conspiracy theories frequently, which as we know is candy for the internet,” says Kahn. Of course, that criticism existed before the coronavirus. But the pandemic’s frenetic news cycle has drawn more people online, deepening worries about the network’s influence.In April, more than 180 journalism school faculty members and media professionals signed an open letter to Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch, co-chairmen of Fox Corp. regarding the network’s coverage of Covid-19, which they said contained false statements and misleading information. Victor Pickard, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania and one of the signatories, says Fox News anchors often “misrepresent complex social problems and issues,” such as the Black Lives Matters protest. “Fox tends to produce content that emphasizes fear and outrage,” he says. Fox has disputed charges of misrepresentation in its news coverage and a representative pointed to several reports from the network on the severity of the pandemic.At times, this outrage has become too much for sponsors. In June, a handful of advertisers, including The Walt Disney Co. and T-Mobile US Inc., pulled commercials from Fox’s Tucker Carlson Tonight show after the host’s inflammatory remarks about a Black Lives Matter protest. A spokesperson for Disney said last month that its ads were placed via a third-party buyer. Earlier this week, Carlson devoted parts of his show to debunking the established science on wearing masks to prevent the spread of coronavirus. (Sean Hannity, another popular anchor, has released a PSA in favor of masks.)Carlson does particularly well on YouTube, which shares more than half the money it gets from video-advertising sales with publishers. Of the 10 most-popular Fox News clips in June, seven were from the conservative journalist and political commentator. Neither Disney nor T-Mobile responded to questions from Bloomberg Businessweek about whether they’ve pulled ads from Carlson’s YouTube videos.Exactly how much traffic can be attributed to YouTube’s shift is hard to gauge because Google doesn’t release that information. Mark Ledwich, a data scientist who studies YouTube’s systems, estimates Fox News netted over 248 million views from recommendations in June, some 75 million more than MSNBC.Fox News is also getting better at the internet. In May, it boasted record audience numbers, pulling in more than 100 million online viewers for a sixth consecutive month. Although on YouTube, Fox News has fewer subscribers than CNN and even some big YouTube personalities like Philip DeFranco, it’s become more adept at deploying search-engine tricks to help ensure explosive clips go viral. “Legacy media initially brought a knife to the YouTube gun fight,” says Kahn. “Now of course they know that’s where the money is.”Jason Ehrich, executive vice president of audience development and strategic partnerships for Fox News Media, says the network’s triumphs aren’t only attributable to YouTube recommendations. Fox has formed an entire team devoted just to YouTube, and grown savvier at posting popular breaking news streams. “Our success on YouTube can be attributed to a multitude of factors,” he wrote in an emailed statement to Bloomberg BusinessWeek.Fox’s growing reach is especially apparent to smaller YouTubers. Some even say its algorithm change favors traditional media, ironic considering former YouTube CEO Salar Kamanagar said in a 2011 speech that users of its platform could be as famous as stars on networks like CNN, MTV or ESPN.David Pakman, a left-leaning vlogger, estimates he’s lost about 5.5 million views a month. He’s found that fans can watch 10 clips of his show in a row and still only be fed “corporate media” in the recommendations box. While he welcomes YouTube\\'s efforts against conspiracy theories, its blunt process stings. “I’ve essentially been collateral damage,” he says.In a clip in January, he outlined a new report from nonprofit group Avaaz that found when people search for climate change videos on YouTube, as many as one in five of the “Up Next” recommendations were stories about climate science denial. One prominent video from Fox News featured.  “This is destroying my channel,” Pakman says in the clip. “It’s so disheartening and crushing.”'),\n",

It was the second of two joint interviews to discuss their new company, but the first since the world locked down because of Covid-19. James was in their hometown of Akron, while Carter was in L.A. Kobe Bryant’s death in January was followed by the pandemic and the suspension of the NBA season, and then, of course, the horrific killing of George Floyd. “Just seeing that video, how many people were hurt not only in Minneapolis, but all over the world—and especially in the Black community, because we’ve seen this over and over and over. So, you know,” he added, “it’s been a lot that’s gone on in 2020.”The pair thought it was going to be a big year for different reasons. On March 11, the same day the NBA suspended its season and a little more than a week before their adopted hometown ordered residents to shelter in place, James and Carter formed the SpringHill Co. after raising $100 million. They describe it as a media company with an unapologetic agenda: a maker and distributor of all kinds of content that will give a voice to creators and consumers who’ve been pandered to, ignored, or underserved.SpringHill is named for the Akron apartment complex where James and his mom moved when he was in sixth grade. It consolidates the Robot Co., a marketing agency, with two other businesses. The first, SpringHill Entertainment, is behind The Wall, a game show on NBC, and the movie Space Jam: A New Legacy, which stars James and is scheduled to be released next year. The second, Uninterrupted LLC, produces The Shop: Uninterrupted—an HBO talk show featuring James, Carter, and other Black A-list celebrities—as well as Kneading Dough, an online partnership with JPMorgan Chase & Co., in which athletes talk about money to promote financial literacy. (“They do it in a way that’s incredibly relatable,” says Kristin Lemkau, chief executive officer of JPMorgan’s U.S. wealth management business, who created the show with Carter.) Uninterrupted, a hybrid production-marketing business, is also responsible for a Nike Inc. shoe collaboration and a hoodie collection for Pride Month designed with soccer star Megan Rapinoe and basketball great Sue Bird.In a February interview at the Lakers practice facility in El Segundo, they talked about SpringHill as a platform to give people of color the creative control that’s long eluded them. Carter calls the company a “house of brands.” It’s part Disney storytelling power, part Nike coolness, and part Patagonia social impact. In 2020 stories can be told in many different ways—on social media, in films, as well as with sneakers and sweatshirts. “This is ultimately a company that’s about point of view, the community you serve, and empowerment,” says L.A. investment banker Paul Wachter, who helped put the project together. “This is a company designed to move the culture.”At the practice facility, a day after putting up 40 points on the New Orleans Pelicans, James told me: “When we talk about storytelling, we want to be able to hit home, to hit a lot of homes where they feel like they can be a part of that story. And they feel like, Oh, you know what? I can relate to that. It’s very organic to our upbringing.” Carter added: “When you grow up in a place like where we were, no matter how talented you are, if you don’t even know that other things exist, there’s no way for you to ever feel empowered because you’re like, I’m confined to this small world. That’s our duty. A lot of exposure.”What was aspirational in February is a lot more real now. Black people are dying from the coronavirus at more than twice the rate of Whites, amid a recession in which Black unemployment has climbed to its highest level in more than a decade, and while an historic wave of protests is sweeping across the country—and world. But these are the times James and Carter find themselves in, and they may be the two people best suited to help others voice and answer the questions we’re all asking. Discussions about race dominate media. Books about White privilege and anti-racism top bestseller lists; U.S. demand for Netflix Inc.’s satirical Dear White People and When They See Us, a miniseries about the Central Park Five, skyrocketed as protests got under way, according to Parrot Analytics. HBO Max temporarily removed Gone With the Wind from its catalog (in honor of Juneteenth, HBO.com made The Watchmen available for free), while Epic Games Inc. got rid of police cars in Fortnite.Carter took advantage of the lockdown to spend virtual one-on-one time with the 105 employees of the new venture, as well as to finalize partnerships. He signed a TV production deal with Walt Disney Co. and is working with Netflix on a basketball-themed movie that would star Adam Sandler. A series he worked on with Netflix, Self-Made, about Madam C.J. Walker, a Black woman who created a beauty empire in the early 20th century, starring Octavia Spencer, premiered in March.As the pandemic ground Hollywood to a halt, SpringHill Entertainment joined with Laurene Powell Jobs’s XQ Institute to produce a virtual ceremony James hosted called Graduate Together: America Honors the High School Class of 2020. It featured addresses by former President Obama and Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai.Carter said on Zoom, “I’m getting a lot of calls from other CEOs. A lot of calls on, ‘What are you doing? What do you think we should be doing?’ I’m explaining to people, ‘Don’t treat this as a moment,’\\u200a” he said.\\u2009 This is bigger than a moment—the attention that issues of inequality are getting right now is “more like what this country should be, and what this world should be,” he said. “We’ve always been about empowering people who feel like us and come from the communities that we come from and want to believe in our mission.”Devin Johnson, SpringHill’s chief operating officer, says that diversity is built into the company. He says its employees are 64% people of color and 40% female. “I’ve never had to convene a task force,” he says, as other companies scramble to figure out how they can be more reflective of society.SpringHill might just sound like another superstar athlete’s vanity project. But Johnson says the company isn’t set up for—and around—a single athlete; rather, it’s a platform in his image: “You can’t create a real digital business on a celebrity. We don’t do that with LeBron. He is our founder and our North Star, but the business isn’t built on everything touching him.”That attitude has freed up James for other projects—like, for example, playing professional basketball. Play is scheduled to resume on July 30, with 22 teams competing for spots in the playoffs, all to be held in a quarantine bubble at Walt Disney World in Orlando. Many have picked the Lakers to win the title.And earlier this month, James recruited current NBA stars such as Trae Young of the Atlanta Hawks, as well as former star and now broadcaster Jalen Rose, to form More Than a Vote. The group is focused on protecting voter rights and preventing suppression, especially in Black communities. James announced it after social media posts showed people waiting for hours to cast ballots in Georgia’s primaries. “We’ve had voter suppression for so long,” James said on Zoom. “People not understanding how they can vote, where they can vote, if their vote really counts.”After forming the group, James was criticized by Hong Kong democracy activist Joshua Wong, who accused him of being hypocritical. Wong said in a tweet that James’s position didn’t align with past comments. He was widely criticized last year for calling Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey’s support for the city’s protesters “misinformed.”In February, when I asked what he’d learned from that experience, James said it taught him to “keep an open mind about how to continue to get better.” On the June 23 call, James said: “I speak about things that I’m knowledgeable about, that I’m educated on. And at the end of the day, right is right, and wrong is wrong. I want the betterment of people—no matter skin color, no matter race, no matter anything.”A little more than a decade ago, it might have seemed unlikely that James and Carter would amass a war chest of $100 million. The investors are financial services company Guggenheim Partners LLC, UC Investments, News Corp. heir Elisabeth Murdoch’s content company Sister, and SC.Holdings, the investment fund run by entrepreneur Jason Stein. James is chairman of SpringHill, and Carter is CEO. Joining them on the board, in addition to Murdoch and Guggenheim’s Scott Minerd, are Serena Williams, Apollo Global Management co-founder Marc Rowan, Live Nation Entertainment Inc. CEO Michael Rapino, Boston Red Sox Chairman Tom Werner, and Wachter.Carter was three years ahead of James at St. Vincent-St. Mary High School in Akron. When the Cleveland Cavaliers drafted James in 2003, Carter went to work at Nike full time. “Growing up, that was my favorite company, and I thought I loved it because of the shoes and sports,” Carter said in February. “In reality, they told me amazing stories about the athletes I cared about.”He became James’s wingman in 2005. Their first major project, The Decision, was a failure. In a spectacle aired live on ESPN in July 2010, James announced—30 minutes in—that he was leaving Cleveland and signing a free-agent contract with the Miami Heat. “I’m gonna take my talents to South Beach,” he said. The theatrics didn’t sit well; Cleveland fans who felt betrayed burned his jersey. The sin was forgiven when he returned to the Cavs in 2014 and broke the city’s half-century championship drought two years later.For many, the failure of The Decision validated suspicions that Carter was just another star athlete’s friend. But, Carter said, the fiasco helped him grow as a businessman. Even if their approach had been off, the importance of owning your own story, not just hawking someone else’s, wasn’t lost on Carter, or James—or on anyone else in the NBA, for that matter. What was underappreciated at the time was that The Decision ushered in an era of player empowerment that’s spread to other sports, as well as collegiate and high school athletics. There’s virtually no athlete who doesn’t feel emboldened to weigh in on just about anything on social media and demand a semblance of career control that would have been unheard of 20 years ago.In 2014, Carter and Wachter negotiated James’s deal with Nike, which ultimately will pay him more than $1 billion. Wachter, who’s advised Bono and Arnold Schwarzenegger, helped James and Carter team up with Cannondale bikes and Beats Electronics, a partnership that earned James more than $100 million when Apple Inc. bought Beats for $3 billion in 2014, say people familiar with the deal. And an arrangement to fold LRMR Marketing & Branding (now LRMR Ventures), the firm that still handles James’s endorsements, into Fenway Sports Management—owner of the Boston Red Sox, the New England Sports Network, and Liverpool Football Club—gave them equity in the English Premier League. “Through all of that, they’ve just said, ‘We’re going to do things our own way, and we’re going to write our own tickets,’\\u2009” Wachter says. SpringHill, he adds, is “ultimately a manifestation of that.”With those deals under way, Carter moved to L.A. in 2014 and turned his attention to media. He signed a production deal with Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. that gave James and him offices on the lot—on the fictional Wisteria Lane from Desperate Housewives, the satirical epitome of White suburban life.Creating content that caters to the opposite of that is what Carter, James, and their backers want to do. UC Regents Chief Investment Officer Jagdeep Singh Bachher says: “This is not a time to slow down. This a time to double down on what they’re doing. There’s a need for leadership in the country, a need for examples that are inspiring for the country, and a need for content to mobilize the country in the right direction.”James has cited Muhammad Ali as a role model. “Everyone was so fascinated about how great a boxer he was,” he said in February. “I think that was the least thing in his mind. Every day he was trying to figure out how to better the world. I think 80%, 90% of the people didn’t agree with anything that he did back when he was doing it. But that didn’t stop him. He stayed focused on his mission, and that’s what we’re talking about. The mission.”On the Zoom call, James praised NBA Commissioner Adam Silver for encouraging players to speak up and for using “the NBA shield to back us.” When asked about the NFL’s treatment of Colin Kaepernick, the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback who took a knee during the national anthem to protest racial inequality and hasn’t played in the NFL since 2016, he said, “We have not heard that official apology to a man who basically sacrificed everything for the better of this world.” (NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said in mid-June that he would “encourage” a team to sign Kaepernick.)If there’s pressure on SpringHill to rise to the occasion, the founders are lucky that neither of them is new to expectations. James, after all, was on the cover of Sports Illustrated when he was a junior in high school. “I’m OK having that pressure of my community and other Black communities across America that look up to me and look to me for inspiration or for guidance,” he said in our last interview. “It’s just my responsibility, and I completely understand that. And so every day I leave my home, or I wake up out of my bed, I understand that it’s not just about me. I’m representing so many people.”\\n \\nRead next: Americans Rush to Start Businesses, Stoking Optimism for Rebound '),\n",

       "  \"Funds aim to attract Muslims and Christians seeking to align their money and their values.ILLUSTRATION: 731As much as Samim Abedi loved his job as part of the team that managed Google’s corporate investment portfolio, he couldn’t always square the work with his Muslim faith. He worried that some of the companies whose securities he traded had ties to alcohol or tobacco or gambling.So he quit to join Wahed Invest, which in July 2019 launched the first exchange-traded fund in the U.S. that’s compliant with Sharia, Islam’s religious law. It’s one of eight ETFs introduced in the U.S. last year that incorporate faith-based principles, raising the total to 11. More are coming: In June, money manager Global X filed to launch a bond fund aligned to Catholic values. “We’re all trying to solve the same question,” says Abedi, the global head of portfolio management for Wahed. “How do we invest our wealth in ways that align with our ethics?”Religion-based funds can differ on what they consider ethical. A stock fund that caters to Catholics shuns companies that sell weapons or exploit child labor. Several ETFs for Muslims steer clear of anything related to interest-based finance, which the religion frowns upon. Those funds invest in a Sharia-compliant alternative to bonds called sukuk, which provide regular payments that are considered profit-sharing rather than interest.The surge in religious ETF offerings has come alongside the boom in responsible investing, often referred to by the shorthand ESG, for environmental, social, and governance. Global assets in ETFs under the ESG category have almost doubled in the past year, now reaching more than $110 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. There’s about $1.9 billion globally in equity-focused religious and exclusionary ETFs. That’s tiny, compared to the more than $6 trillion in overall ETF assets, but money managers think there’s a big untapped market. “We felt like it was a prime opportunity to go into a business where there really isn’t much competition at the moment,” says Naushad Virji, chief executive officer of SP Funds, another ETF operator, about the Muslim investing space.“We refuse to invest in companies that are pursuing an unholy agenda”Abedi’s fund, Wahed FTSE USA Shariah ETF, trades under the ticker HLAL, a nod to halal, an Arabic word for permissible. It tracks an index compiled by the FTSE Russell, which works with a board of experts that determines each company is compliant. “They’re not just rules for the sake of being difficult,” says Abedi. Similarly, the SP Funds S&P 500 Sharia Industry Exclusions ETF follows a version of the S&P 500 index which has been screened for religious objections. (SP Funds and S&P Dow Jones Indices, which created the index and licenses its use, are unrelated companies.)Defining ESG stocks in general is fraught—different companies have different understandings of the rules their clients want to follow. Religious beliefs add layers of complexity, and disagreement can be strong even within religious groups. “This is a much-disputed area. What constitutes ethical investing?” says Luke Bretherton, professor of theological ethics at the Duke Divinity School.Wahed’s ETF, for instance, doesn’t own banks or companies that get revenue from the sale of alcohol or pork products. Yet some of its top holdings, such as Tesla Inc., carry a lot of interest-bearing debt. And while makers or sellers of weapons are shunned by indexes tracked by the Wahed and SP Funds, some Muslim-based indexes allow those companies.At Timothy Plan, which since 1994 has managed what it calls “biblically-oriented” mutual funds, companies that manufacture firearms are acceptable. But it won’t hold Target Corp. because of, among other reasons, the retailer’s policy allowing people to use bathrooms that correspond to their gender identity. According to founder Arthur Ally, shares of Walt Disney Co. are also out in part because the company produces entertainment showcasing “unbiblical” married lifestyles. “We refuse to invest in companies that are pursuing an unholy agenda,” Ally says. The company created four ETFs last year after requests from financial advisers. The biggest has about $142 million in assets, according to the firm's website.Generally, ETFs need to cross the threshold of about $50 million in assets to become a breakeven business for a money manager. The six-month-old SP Funds equity ETF has attracted about $25 million since its debut. Wahed’s ETF has seen inflows of about $35 million since its July 2019 launch. Abedi says Wahed has “ambitious internal sales targets” as it markets to investors of all faiths, who may also appreciate screens against gambling, tobacco, or weapons. The core goal, though, is to be true to Islam. There are, after all, more than 3.45 million Muslims in the U.S. “A lot of firms have shied away from catering to the Muslim community more properly,” he says. “We’ve really embraced it.”\"),\n",

       "  'The film outperformed Universal’s most optimistic projections, giving exhibitors yet another thing to worry about.An AMC movie theater near Times Square in New York on May 3.As movie theaters around the world closed in early March to contain the spread of the coronavirus, executives at Universal Pictures scrambled to limit their potential losses.The studio started by delaying the release of F9, the next installment in the Fast & Furious franchise. While the studio had already spent millions of dollars marketing the film, including a spot during February’s Super Bowl, it wanted to save its biggest movies for a traditional release. But as Universal looked down its slate of coming titles, it saw an opportunity to experiment. Rather than wait for theaters to reopen at an uncertain date, it would release the animated movie Trolls World Tour for people to watch at home—charging $20 for a 48-hour rental.Releasing a movie for home rental may not sound like a bold move given the thousands of films available via Amazon, Hulu, iTunes, and Netflix. But the most lucrative entertainment franchises in the world—Star Wars, Fast & Furious, and Harry Potter—all began in movie theaters. The amount of money a movie makes from DVD sales, licensing to streaming services, and toy sales is all based on box-office returns. The same goes for potential sequels, TV series, and spinoffs. It’s unclear how much money a movie can make through rentals alone. So when Universal released Trolls World Tour directly to home viewing, it risked potentially hundreds of millions in revenue on an experiment.Within a couple of weeks of its online debut, the Trolls movie shattered Universal’s most optimistic models, grossing about $200 million, and convinced the studio that some of its films could turn a profit without a theatrical release. Universal slated The King of Staten Island, a comedy from Knocked Up director Judd Apatow, for a digital release in June, and will premiere High Note, a dramedy starring Dakota Johnson and Tracee Ellis Ross, at home, too. Universal is now reexamining the release plan for its entire schedule this year.Selected domestic release date changes made this yearData: Box Office Mojo“It [Trolls] provided consumers with a product that they desperately needed at home, particularly if you have a bunch of 7-year-olds and 5-year-olds running around,” Jeff Shell, chief executive officer of NBCUniversal, told Wall Street analysts on April 30. While the studio will continue to release movies in theaters when they reopen, he said, these at-home rentals are here to stay. “It’s not going to be a replacement, but it’s going to be a complementary element.”Not everyone was pleased. Adam Aron, CEO of AMC Entertainment Holdings, the nation’s No.\\u20091 theater chain, fired off a letter to Universal Studios Chairman Donna Langley that severed a decades-long partnership. AMC, Aron wrote, would never again play any Universal movies on its 11,000 screens.Universal’s experiment couldn’t have come at a worse time for theaters, which have been buffeted by declining attendance and the rise of streaming. In 2019 the average American went to fewer than three and a half movies, the lowest in 92 years. Cinephiles have blamed studios’ overreliance on comic book movies and sequels, but the simple fact is that young people no longer rely on the theater to entertain them every Friday night. They can watch YouTube on their phones and movies at home, or play video games with friends.Saddled with large piles of debt from recent expansion sprees and facing the prospect of scant revenue for the foreseeable future, theater operators saw Shell’s chest-thumping over the Trolls release as an existential threat. “Companies are fighting for their existence,” says Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter, “and Universal said, ‘Maybe we won’t bother with theaters anymore.’\\u2009”Universal could have softened the blow by framing it as a temporary reaction to an unprecedented situation, as some of its peers have. Walt Disney Co. shifted a couple of movies once destined for theaters to its streaming service, Disney+, while Paramount sold a romantic comedy, The Lovebirds, to Netflix. Warner Bros. came the closest to copying Universal, announcing plans to release a Scooby-Doo animated movie for rental at home. None of them received a public drubbing from theater chains. But Universal didn’t give theaters much time to prepare, notifying them only on the morning of its Trolls announcement.The strong response from AMC and grousing by the National Association of Theatre Owners scared some studios. Still, Aron’s claim of a Universal ban is likely an empty threat. Movie theaters can’t afford to skip showing Universal fare such as the Minions sequel or the next James Bond film. And the studio can’t profitably release all its movies online only. So, rather than a declaration of war, this recent contretemps is more likely a prelude to a negotiation that could reshape the way movies are released for years to come.Some theaters are already experimenting with their own online options. Independent ones have partnered with movie distributor Kino Lorber for online showings where they split the proceeds 50-50. Universal might not give up 50% of its online sales, but it’s likely to share some.“I feel viscerally that there is a paradigm shift going on,” says Richard Lorber, head of Kino Lorber. “The theaters, which have been struggling to define their identity in this new digital landscape, have a moment to occupy a piece of the digital turf.”\\n \\nRead more: Six Feet Apart and Prepackaged Beer—Concerts Start Again in Covid Era'),\n",

       "  'UFC bouts featuring (from top) Nate Quarry, Cung Le, and Kyle Kingsbury.PHOTO ILLUSTRATION: 731; PHOTOS: GETTY IMAGESAs it sends fighters to battle through the pandemic, the dominant force in MMA has been fighting allegations it abuses monopoly power.To make it to the press conference after his first Ultimate Fighting Championship win, Cung Le needed a wheelchair. The cut above his eye required stitches, and he’d bruised a foot so badly kicking his opponent in the head that he was worried it was broken. As he made his way to his microphone on crutches, he recalls, he already knew his boss was pissed that he looked so obviously hurt. When Dana White, president of the mixed martial arts promoter, saw Le wheeling to the press conference, Le remembers him saying, “What the f---?”The event that night had drawn 15,000 people to Las Vegas’s MGM Grand Garden Arena, with 900,000 pay-per-view customers watching at home. When a reporter asked Le, who’d won a unanimous decision in one of the main undercard bouts, what he’d do next, the 40-year-old middleweight said he wasn’t sure. In his mind, he says, he was thinking mostly about tending to his throbbing foot. White, whose company had recently acquired the rival promoter Le previously fought under, jumped in with a different response: “What he meant was, ‘I’m going to go back, get back in the gym, and I’d love to fight in China.’ I’m translating for Cung.” The crowd laughed.Le, who’d arrived in the U.S. as a child refugee from Vietnam—and learned martial arts to defend himself against bullies—managed an awkward smile. Then he did his best to repeat White’s words (“I’m going to go back in the gym and get ready for China”), even though this was the first he’d heard about it. UFC scheduled Le’s next fight for a few months on, just after the 2012 U.S. presidential election.A few weeks later, Le told White and Lorenzo Fertitta, one of the billionaire brothers behind UFC, that he didn’t know if his doctor would clear him to fight again so soon. He was still giving strangers a wide berth, so that no one would step on his foot. But Le says White put his hand on Le’s shoulder, told Le he knew he was a “company man,” and said he needed to “suck it up.” Seated to either side of Le, White and Fertitta told him to do whatever it took to get cleared, leaving him with the strong impression that saying no would derail his career. “They said it very nicely,” Le says.So he took a bunch of painkillers and told his doctor his injured foot felt fine, even though the pain from stretching was enough to make him sweat. The doctor objected because he had a bone bruise, which can take months to recover from, but Le begged to be cleared. While UFC paid Le a reported $150,000 for the Vegas fight, he says that after taxes and expenses, including lengthy physical rehabilitation, he couldn’t afford to land on White’s enemies list.Then as now, fighters had little alternative but to obey UFC, Le says. After the doctor ultimately obliged Le, UFC—whose then-owners would go on to make headlines for buying a $125 million boat, hiring Bruno Mars for a daughter’s $25 million wedding, and importing snow to White’s home in the Las Vegas desert—offered him a ticket to China in coach. Le won that fight in the first round with a one-punch knockout. But a couple years later, in his final, bloody UFC bout, he could tell between rounds how many fingers a doctor was holding up only because his trainer tipped him off with shoulder taps. The match was stopped in the fourth.UFC contests Le’s account. “If necessary, we will prove in court what Cung Le says is not true,” says attorney William Isaacson. “Dana White never asks an athlete to compete while injured. Normally, the athletes try to hide their injuries so they can compete.”Many UFC fighters have stories similar to Le’s. Even now, with the Covid-19 pandemic raging, White has often come across as more concerned about the public’s hunger for entertainment than his fighters’ safety. At a moment when pent-up demand for sports has made old footage of Michael Jordan a weekly must-watch for millions of people, the UFC president is promising 12 bouts on May 9, including two world title fights, at the VyStar Veterans Memorial Arena in Jacksonville, Fla., the land that sheltering in place forgot. No spectators will be in attendance, just fighters and staff, but the combatants will be allowed well within 6 feet of one another, because Governor Ron DeSantis, unlike most of his peers, has declared athletics an essential industry.On May 2, programming-starved ESPN broadcast an 11-hour block of kinda-sorta-sports including sign spinning, cheese rolling, and cherry-pit spitting. Nascar says it will return without fans in the stands on May 17, the PGA Tour is planning to start up in June, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is lobbying for baseball to return in either Florida or Arizona around July 4. But UFC will be the first big event to draw the waiting audience of ravenous sports fans. “My team is ready to go, and the fighters are excited to get back in there,” White said in a statement last month. UFC said in an emailed statement that it’s committed to resuming its events safely and responsibly.Yet even more so than usual, the fighters will assume an outsize portion of risk in exchange for what have long been far stingier rewards than what many of their pro athlete peers earn. Unlike leagues including the NFL, NBA, and Major League Baseball, all of which pay about half their revenue to players, the share of UFC revenue that goes to fighters hovers at or below 20%, according to a report prepared a few years ago by the media company Endeavor. Brandon Ross, an analyst at researcher LightShed Partners, estimates that UFC’s media rights and sponsorship deals for 2020 were worth around $750 million, though that may be contingent on the promoter actually staging the fights it’s promised broadcasters. For one of its roughly 600 fighters (500 men and 100 women), a televised bout can gross as little as $13,500, before taxes and their many medical and training expenses.Le says that should change. He’s one of a half-dozen former UFC fighters, including a former title contender, behind an audacious $5 billion antitrust lawsuit against Zuffa LLC, the company incorporated to serve as UFC’s parent. The suit, which after five years of legal wrangling could soon be certified as a class action with 1,200 claimants, accuses UFC of leveraging monopoly power against fighters and holding down their pay.UFC says that it’s the best-paying promoter in MMA and that the lawsuit is baseless and senseless. When companies take risks that pay off like UFC has, they attract competition and “should be encouraged, not villainized,” Isaacson said in an emailed statement. The lawsuit, he said, is “a threat to all companies’ ability to grow and succeed.”The plaintiffs, and some of the internal documents their lawsuit has unearthed, suggest the opposite: that UFC has relied on predatory tactics to ensure it’s the only real venue for professional fighting men and women and that it’s a very hard place to leave. “There’s no other option,” Le says. “They basically own you.”UFC isn’t your average face-kicking contest. The fighters behind the antitrust suit say it controls 90% of the market for MMA, a sport it’s worked successfully to turn from punchline into worldwide sensation. (Zuffa contests the percentage but doesn’t offer its own estimate.) UFC claims to be the largest provider of pay-per-view events on Earth, counting some 318 million Nielsen viewers. Its fans include President Trump, an early ally. In November, with the threat of impeachment looming, Trump showed up at New York City’s Madison Square Garden to watch UFC fighters square off for the title of “Baddest Motherf---er,” a term UFC is trying to copyright.White has continued to run UFC’s day-to-day operations even after he and the Fertitta brothers sold Zuffa for $4 billion to Endeavor and private equity firms Silver Lake Partners and KKR & Co. in 2016. Two years later he signed a five-year, $1.5 billion deal for the TV rights to UFC bouts with ESPN, gaining Walt Disney Co.’s imprimatur in the process.White’s creation myth is built on sharp turns. As he’s told it to reporters over the years, in the late 1980s, when he was 19 years old, he walked off his job as a hotel valet in Boston to go into the fight business. He spent several years in boxing—managing fighters and gyms, refereeing bouts, giving lessons—then somehow ran afoul of mobster Whitey Bulger. In 1995, when Bulger’s right-hand man called to demand a payoff, White booked a one-way flight to his hometown of Las Vegas, where he started working with MMA fighters as well as boxers.A few years later, White learned that UFC was in deep financial trouble, so he teamed up with Lorenzo Fertitta, an old school buddy turned casino owner, and Fertitta’s brother, Frank, to buy it in 2001 for $2 million. At the time, UFC was one of a handful of struggling organizers of MMA fights, which had been denounced by Senator John McCain as “human cockfighting” and outlawed in most U.S. states. “We bought a company that wasn’t allowed on pay-per-view,” White told a group of Stanford MBA students in 2013. “Porn is on pay-per-view.”Hoping to drag MMA from the outer fringes of polite society to the regular fringes, White and Lorenzo, who’d served on Nevada’s athletic commission, negotiated with state regulators around the country to make their events legal again. In Atlantic City, N.J., the Trump Taj Mahal became the first name-brand venue to host one of the new UFC’s bouts. White has called Trump “the first guy who gave us our break.” The UFC team also plowed tens of millions of dollars into image-building efforts aimed at the masses, including a reality show, The Ultimate Fighter. To get the show on Spike TV, the MMA execs paid the first season’s production costs themselves. At first, most advertisers refused to let their ads run during the show.Even if face-kicking isn’t your cup of energy drink, it’s easy to see why MMA eventually became such a draw. Rather than a balletic display of martial artistry, a UFC match looks more like a real-world brawl. The combatants start out standing in an octagonal ring, then shift to and from the ground, blending striking and grappling techniques drawn from boxing, kickboxing, wrestling, judo, Brazilian jiujitsu, muay thai, and other disciplines.In MMA’s early days, competition between promoters meant fighters had more leverage to negotiate. During its first decade under White, though, UFC broke away from its rivals. It wove compelling personal narratives in with extreme displays of locker-room bravado, from thrown shoes and shoutfests to a guy on a leash being dragged on all fours to the Baha Men classic, Who Let the Dogs Out?And when it came time to negotiate, UFC offered no quarter. Its contracts could require fighters to do autograph sessions and open workouts for free and to let UFC profit from their likenesses in video games and trading cards without going back for permission. (UFC says it compensates featured fighters, and that they can strike their own likeness deals, too, “so long as they do not use the UFC name, brand, or intellectual property.”) Fighters also ate the costs of training, gear, a range of medical bills, and their own payroll taxes, because they were classified as independent contractors, like Uber drivers. Unlike Uber drivers, however, UFC fighters had to submit to surprise drug tests, and agree not to work for competitors.Under White, UFC signed exclusive contracts with fighters for a certain number of bouts in a given period, with the company retaining the right to extend the deal if they got injured, turned down a matchup set by management, became a champion, or even tried to retire. UFC regularly revisited deals before their terms were up, and in internal emails an executive described getting a fighter to take a pay cut in exchange for not getting terminated mid-contract. UFC said in a statement that people rarely re-sign for less money.UFC was also steadily acquiring or chasing off rivals such as Affliction and Pride, allowing White to scoop up popular fighters and eliminate alternatives for those in his stable who were unhappy with their deals. It didn’t hesitate to exercise its leverage: In 2008 White announced he was terminating title contender Jon Fitch and blackballing the crew of fighters training with him over what Fitch says was his reluctance to cede lifelong video game likeness rights without compensation. “Unwilling to sacrifice the careers of my coaches and teammates, and believing I had no choice, I signed the agreement,” Fitch, now a plaintiff in the lawsuit, said in an emailed statement. In its own statement, UFC called the issue “a disagreement that was eventually resolved,” noting that Fitch and the other fighters stayed on.In 2007, Randy Couture, a former heavyweight champion, announced his resignation from UFC, citing pay disputes with management and a desire to fight Fedor Emelianenko, a Russian grappler widely viewed as the best heavyweight in the world. UFC sued, alleging breach of contract, disparagement, and conspiracy. It won an injunction that restricted Couture from promoting competitors’ events and derailed billionaire Mark Cuban’s attempt to arrange a Couture-Emelianenko bout for his own fledgling circuit. Couture soon returned to the UFC fold. “They were going to drag it out as long as they could and basically try to bankrupt me,” he later told the news site MMA Junkie, saying he’d already spent $500,000 on legal fees. Cuban’s company abandoned its plans to hold live events and switched to simply broadcasting them.In 2011, Zuffa acquired UFC’s most prominent remaining competitor—Strikeforce, where Le was fighting. The month before the deal was completed, UFC’s longtime bout matchmaker, Joe Silva, highlighted Zuffa’s control of most of the world’s top fighters in an internal email with the subject line “We Own MMA.”As UFC’s power has grown, fighters say, the terms of their deals have gotten worse. In the early years they could negotiate their own sponsorships and keep the money. Then UFC started demanding a share. Then it flipped the negotiating process so that it was negotiating an exclusive apparel sponsorship directly with Reebok and could disburse a pool of sponsorship money at its discretion. UFC says its direct negotiations have raised the caliber of sponsors associated with its fighters.UFC has also been accused of exploiting its control over fights as leverage in contract negotiations. In an internal email, Silva, who worked at UFC from 1995 to 2016, suggested that if a fighter rejected UFC’s contract renewal offer, he’d be matched with “a really tough guy for his last fight.” The fighter would end up staying with UFC. Asked about the email, Isaacson said “it would be inaccurate to say that Joe Silva made any threats.”UFC says that there’s plenty of competition in MMA (including Bellator, a promoter owned by Viacom) and that it controls less than one-quarter of the world’s ranked MMA fighters. Weighted by revenue, however, UFC’s share of the workforce has for years topped 70%, according to the former fighters seeking restitution.White, too, has bragged about UFC’s dominance. In 2008 he posted a video on YouTube in which he held a tombstone with the logos of three former rival promoters and declared himself “the Grim Reaper.” In a 2012 tweet he reveled in his acquisition of Pride Fighting Championships: “pride is dead dummy! I killed em!!!” During his 2013 visit to Stanford’s business school, he told the assembled MBA students that keeping fighters hungry for bonuses was key to his success. With boxing, “you get two multimillionaires, right, who step into the ring and do everything they can to avoid a fight,” White said, retreating theatrically across the stage. “We incentivize guys to fight.”The former UFC fighters filed their suit in federal district court at the end of 2014. They allege that the company “has engaged in an illegal scheme to eliminate competition,” allowing it to pay fighters “a fraction of what they would earn in a competitive marketplace.” The strategy the suit lays out isn’t dissimilar from one used in the octagon: ground and pound.The uninitiated—including Bloomberg Businessweek, when it first contacted the plaintiffs—might refer for edification to a 2009 match between co-plaintiff Nate Quarry and Jason MacDonald. During a recent screening of the match, Quarry recounts his thought process as he forced his opponent to the floor (the grounding) and elbowed him in the forehead. “I waited for the blood to hit his eye,” Quarry says. Then, with MacDonald trapped and his vision obstructed, “I just started beating him” (the pounding).During his final UFC fight the following spring, Quarry carried on with half his face caved in, injuries that would require 13 screws and a titanium mesh. He says UFC paid him roughly $40,000 and called afterward to say that because he’d been injured, his contract had been extended. Two years later, with two fights still left on the contract, Quarry announced his retirement on Spike TV, ending a half-decade career in which he’d fought bouts while brutally injured, sick with the flu, and $25,000 in debt. He says he’s received more money as a spokesman for the company that made the implant in his damaged spine than UFC ever paid him.Side gigs were common among the plaintiffs. Kyle Kingsbury, a light heavyweight who fought for UFC from 2008 to 2014, spent many of those years living in his mom’s detached garage and moonlighting as a trainer and bartender. He says that in his best year with UFC he made about $100,000, most of which went to pay taxes and work expenses. Other years, he made far less. “There is no job I’ve had, from my early teens until now, that treated me as poorly,” Kingsbury says. “Burger King treated me better.” During one bout he was hit so hard in the head that he couldn’t remember how to get to the locker room. He says he didn’t ask for help, because if UFC knew he’d been injured, it would mean more time before he got paid again.UFC’s attorney Isaacson says Quarry’s and Kingsbury’s accounts illustrate that “this lawsuit is about individual grievances by fighters no longer with the UFC.”Even if fighters could have gotten out of their deals, they say, there was nowhere else to go. In charging that UFC limited their opportunities, they’ve tapped into growing sentiment against monopolies, particularly what’s called monopsony power—the outsize leverage some employers have because they can limit workers’ opportunities elsewhere, from software engineering to fast food to child care.For much of the past century, academic consensus and judicial precedent have taken as a given that labor markets are competitive, according to Marshall Steinbaum, an economics professor at the University of Utah. But Steinbaum says employers have gained so much power over where and how workers can operate that occasionally a case like the one against UFC emerges with facts too damning to easily dismiss. “If we’re going to see one big labor-antitrust showdown, this is a good place to look for it,” he says. “This case essentially aims a pretty sharp spear directly at the heart of contemporary antitrust law.”White has said that UFC fighters made their choices and ought to live with them. “Nobody made you sign a UFC contract,” he said during a deposition in 2017. “When you signed the contract, you were thrilled.” UFC is being defended by leading corporate litigator Boies Schiller Flexner LLP, the firm that’s also represented the New York Yankees, Theranos, and Harvey Weinstein. During the most recent round of hearings, held late last year to help Judge Richard Boulware of Nevada determine whether to certify the class action, Isaacson, a Boies Schiller partner, said that what the plaintiffs call monopsony amounts to just “being successful.” A win for the plaintiffs, he said, would “be a shock to antitrust enforcement” in the U.S.The plaintiffs’ case centers on their argument that UFC can get away with paying them as little as it does, a much lower share of the sport’s revenue than other pro athletes receive, only because it’s a monopoly. Zuffa has said in court filings that mixed martial artists wouldn’t be earning any kind of living without its spending and savvy. If the fighters themselves were all that was for sale, they would “start their own businesses,” company witness Paul Oyer, an economist at Stanford, testified. “They’re no more the product than an Apple engineer who designs an iPhone.”The plaintiffs retort that UFC fans tune in based on who the fighters are—they’re not just shaping the product. Says Kingsbury: “We’re the f---ing iPhone.”Boulware is able to work from home while Nevada practices social-distancing measures, so a ruling on whether to certify the case as a class action, which could turbocharge the lawsuit, might come any day now. If the class is certified, workers and bosses in other fields will take notice, says Wayne State University law professor Sanjukta Paul. Despite how hostile U.S. antitrust law is to workers, she says, UFC’s conduct has been egregious enough that the fighters could win.The judge has signaled that, absent a settlement, he’s expecting the case to drag on for some time. He’s already told the parties that he’s assuming his class-action ruling will get appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, and from there to the U.S. Supreme Court.Kingsbury says no settlement will be acceptable unless it changes the contracts that keep fighters bound indefinitely to the company. This is the same struggle, he and the other plaintiffs maintain, that pro athletes have consistently faced, from free agency in baseball a half-century ago to the Muhammad Ali Boxing Reform Act passed by Congress in 2000. “Any great sport that comes along,” Kingsbury says, “eventually it comes to this.”The struggle that appears to be top of mind for White, whose contract expires in 2026, is whether he can outmatch a pandemic. Two months ago, as the global economy shut down, he told ESPN his March 21 fight card would proceed as scheduled, just not in London because, you know, flight bans. “This stuff happens to me every weekend,” he said. (He ultimately had to scratch the event, and a couple more, after the Trump administration told Americans to avoid gathering in groups larger than nine.) By early April, he was telling reporters he was close to relocating UFC fights to a private island or to American Indian tribal land in California that wouldn’t be subject to the state’s shelter-in-place order.No plan has been announced on either front, though White told ESPN last month that “Fight Island is a real thing” and that “the infrastructure is being built right now.” In the meantime, he’s gearing up for the May 9 fight in Jacksonville. MMA, he promised in an Instagram post, will be “the first sport back.” So far this year, UFC has held seven fights; the Wall Street Journal reported last month that White’s contract with ESPN calls for a total of 42 before the year is out.Le says White won’t be among the people who have to face the real consequences. Over his years in MMA, he broke his nose four times, cracked ribs, and required five elbow surgeries, three knee surgeries, and more than 100 stitches. His arms don’t bend as far as they’re supposed to.But for all that, Le’s not boycotting MMA as a whole. Quite the opposite: He’s readying his 15-year-old son for a future in the sport, hoping his legal fight will help transform the industry in the meantime. Each morning, he gives the boy a fistful of vitamins and a workout in the garage. His son already has sponsors and 3,000 Instagram followers. A couple years ago, Le recalls with pride, he got 300,000 views for a video of his son hitting a sparring bar that bounced back and hit him in the face. He says he sometimes worries about his son’s safety, but he figures he could also get hurt walking down the street.The 15-year-old is already “a natural beast,” Le tells a college admissions consultant who calls during his interview with Businessweek. The kid’s bouts, he says after hanging up the phone, are “going to be savage. I can’t wait.” '),\n",

       "  'Agent Richard Weitz produces Quarantunes—combination concerts and house parties for the glamorous homebound.Some people—introverts, poets, couples returning from their honeymoon—are good candidates for weathering the lockdown. Richard Weitz wasn’t. The Hollywood agent’s pre-Covid-19 Instagram posts show him courtside at a Los Angeles Lakers game with Josh Groban, at a party in George Lucas’s Chicago apartment, going to the movies with LL Cool J, eating with Lionel Richie at the Polo Lounge in Beverly Hills, posing with Chrissy Teigen in a photo booth, and hanging backstage with Lizzo at her show in Brooklyn, N.Y. For his 50th birthday last year, a fellow agent gifted him a “Richard Weitz 2018-2019 Tour” T-shirt listing the locations of 100 events he’d attended.Now, like the rest of the country, Weitz is stuck in his house, trying to work with only a laptop, spotty Wi-Fi, and a Zoom account. “When shelter-in-place started, I asked Richard if he was OK,” says Candace Nelson, founder of Sprinkles Cupcakes and a judge on the shows Cupcake Wars and Sugar Rush. “Then he started his first Quarantunes. I said, ‘Of course. He’s bringing the events to him.’ He is in his flow right now unlike anyone else I’ve seen.”On Friday nights and Saturday afternoons, Weitz is throwing the most exclusive party—password required—in Los Angeles. And New York, London, and Sydney. Quarantunes, which can run four hours or more, is a combination of talk show (“Don’t go anywhere!” Weitz often implores, as if anyone could) and Hollywood party, the kind that were popular on TV in the 1960s. Weitz, with a scruffy, cropped beard and even scruffier voice, emcees performances by Rick Astley, Weird Al Yankovic, and many more. Attendees flip through 20 pages of screens of other homebound artists, catching a glimpse of actress Tina Fey in her gorgeous library, while her husband makes pizza dough in the background; John Stamos in his den, adorned with a framed, signed photo from his days on General Hospital; pop singer Debbie Gibson going for a walk in a stylish hat; and singer/songwriter Taylor Dayne belting it out from her car while driving.“I’m talking to everyone I’ve ever been a fan of, directly. From my kitchen”Music producer Clive Davis celebrated his birthday at a Quarantunes. L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti stopped by to give updates on fighting the virus before being serenaded by Randy Newman with I Love L.A. After playing I Wanna Get Better, Jack Antonoff said the quarantine made him realize he needs animals in his life; so he talked to songwriter Diane Warren for advice on getting some birds. While Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez sang their songs from Frozen with their two daughters around a piano as Josh Gad smiled along, Walt Disney Co. Chairman Bob Iger went into the chatroom to plug Frozen 2: “Everyone can find it on Disney+ right now.”One night, Jimmy Fallon couldn’t get in because Zoom had reached its 500-person limit. Howard Stern decided not to try. As he said on his radio show, “I don’t want to be stopped by the Zoom doorman.”The parties have become a bright spot in what otherwise hasn’t been the best year for Weitz, a WME partner who co-heads the talent agency’s scripted department. Last April, the Writers Guild of America required its members to give up their agencies amid a fight about television show packaging, decimating his business. “I had no clients. Nothing was going on,” he says. “A year later I’ve made the pivot from representing writers to taking my passion and connecting music artists. I’m talking to everyone I’ve ever been a fan of, directly. From my kitchen.” Weitz’s change in fortunes came via his daughter, Demi. He had no idea what to do for her 17th birthday on March 27. In desperation, he got Chicago piano bar singer Dario Giraldo to perform on a Zoom party for her family and friends, forgetting that teenage girls aren’t typically denizens of piano bars. “It was not my friends’ speed,” Demi remembers. “I was like, ‘Dad, Dad, can we please make this stop?’\\u200a”Weitz wasn’t deterred. A few hours later, he set up a second Zoom party, having convinced his friend John Mayer to sing Happy Birthday. Soon, Mayer was playing guitar for his onetime crush Gibson while she sang Only in My Dreams from her house. This went over much better.Weitz proposed that he and Demi throw another Zoom party the following week. As Quarantunes took off, though, Demi felt discomfited by all the attention she was getting in the Zoom box in their Beverly Hills kitchen. “I felt a little overly privileged to be doing this with what is going on now,” she says. “It wasn’t a good feeling.”She suggested they ask for donations, hoping to raise $10,000 for the Saban Community Clinic in L.A. So far, Demi and her dad have raised more than half a million dollars in total for the clinic, the United Way, and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. Whitney Wolfe Herd, founder and chief executive officer of dating app Bumble, gave $50,000. Yvette Lee Bowser, the creator of the shows Living Single and Half & Half, made a $100,000 donation to the United Way.“Even if people are in isolation, they don’t want to feel like victims,” says Arthur J. Ochoa, senior vice president and chief advancement officer at Cedars-Sinai. “They want to feel like they can do something. And Richard embodies the best of that.” Weitz is planning an event to support a New York-based organization, focusing on Broadway singers and pop artists. So far, no one has turned down his offer to perform, and no one has been paid.Comedian Jeff Ross, whom Weitz yells for between acts to demand a joke (after the fourth hour he told Weitz that he puts the “long” in “sing-along”) says Quarantunes has been a highlight of the lockdown. He and his girlfriend have danced in their kitchen to the performances. “No disrespect to the great artists of our time who are doing these great benefits, but they’re dreadfully depressing,” Ross says. “They’re playing sad songs.” Quarantunes, he says, “has a party spirit. A hopeful vibe.” The events could also provide a glimpse of life after the worst of the pandemic is over. Broadway actress Emmy Raver-Lampman landed two well-paid gigs after covering a Lizzo song. People have gotten back in touch—such as St. Elmo’s Fire actor Rob Lowe and David Foster and John Parr, the writer and singer of the movie’s title song—after not speaking in decades. Actor Henry Winkler keeps coming by because he says it feels “normal,” a feeling everyone is longing for. “You’re happy to see people you haven’t seen in a long time,” he says. “Happy to be a part of the community. We could have been in his living room.”Jonnie Davis, president of ABC Studios, says the parties are “the closest you can get” to real-life interactions. “You probably wouldn’t get all these people in a real party anyway,” he says. “You’d want to go, but your kids have this thing at school. Everybody is sort of here now. It’s not like people are going to dinner at Craig’s tonight.” Weitz is also adjusting to the new normal. As he introduces artists in the virtual greenroom, he asks them to pose on a split screen with him. “I’m still able to get my backstage selfies,” he says.\\n \\nRead more: There Isn’t an Easy Way to Say ‘No’ to a Zoom Meeting'),\n",

No Time To Die, the latest James Bond vehicle, graciously ceded its April 2 theater debut to coronavirus jitters, instead planning to drop the Wednesday before Thanksgiving. Fans had requested the delay, but for Eon, MGM and Universal the risk of a box office disaster was probably too great. “That’s their big movie this year,” said Comscore movie analyst Paul Dergarabedian. “I don’t think they can take any chance with it.”Hollywood scheduling is one of the more fascinating strategy exercises in contemporary business. Studios and distributers are in a perpetual staring contest to slot their most promising movies on open ground or at the very least make sure they don’t open on the same day as similar fare. The respective superheroes from Marvel and DC Comics, for example, will never really slug it out, primarily because they bigfoot a weekend years in advance. (Get ready for Avatar 5 on Dec. 17, 2027; it’s already on the calendar.)“It’s always a chess game,” Dergarabedian explained. “And there’s a little bit of magic to it.”The U.S. box office has actually been pretty resilient, up for the year and posting good numbers even through last weekend. But theaters are shuttered across China, soon to be the world’s biggest movie market, and much of Europe. Production schedules are in tatters Some would say Bond should never have been planned for April anyway. Historically, the franchise has dropped in November. But the studio was hunting for white space. Now, Bond must survive in one of Hollywood’s most cutthroat weekends, going up against Disney\\'s Raya and the Last Dragon and days after the release of Godzilla vs. Kong.Meanwhile, a slate of blockbuster bait is lined up (and may eventually be subject a similar shift) including Black Widow (May 1), the ninth Fast and Furious vehicle (May 22), the Wonder Woman sequel (June 5) and Top Gun: Maverick (June 25). Make no mistake, every consumer-facing executive—from convention planners and cruise ship bosses to smartphone salesman and lobster fishermen—is facing the same calculus at the moment.The returns are certainly diminishing as crowds thin out, however the spoils—or at least the share—could increase for those who stay in the game. Savvy strategists aren’t just trying to gauge demand but also divine the strength of their rivals’ stomachs.Indeed, shortly after Bond decamped, the puzzle pieces started moving in Hollywood. Trolls World Tour bumped its U.S. debut up by a week to fill the space 007 left open, while Saint Maud, an A24 horror film, delayed its launch to do the same.As they say on Game of Thrones: chaos is a ladder.'),\n",

       "  'The crew fled so quickly after last week’s decision to delay filming of “Mission: Impossible 7,” Paramount Pictures forgot to cancel the welcome party at the opulent Gritti Palace Hotel in Venice, Italy. When a handful of straggling technical workers showed up, they feasted with silver cutlery and exquisite china in a mostly abandoned banquet hall.That kind of confusion -- and needless spending -- has been characteristic of Hollywood in the coronavirus era. On-location production work, often planned years in advance, has been rescheduled at great cost. After halting filming in Venice, Paramount said this week that “Mission: Impossible” shooting scheduled for Rome this month would also be delayed. And even completed films are in trouble: Shuttered movie theaters in Asia have forced studios to scrap some premieres and rethink their schedules for the rest of the year.The trailer for the Bond film ‘No Time to Die’ is aired in London’s Piccadilly Circus in December.PHOTOGRAPHER: VICTORIA JONES/PA IMAGES VIA GETTY IMAGESThe biggest setback came on Wednesday when the James Bond sequel “No Time to Die” was pushed back till November, turning a spring tent-pole movie into holiday-season fare. The film’s backers looked at the state of the global movie-theater industry -- the Chinese market shutdown, and attendance plummeting in France, Italy, Hong Kong and South Korea -- and couldn’t stomach putting out a would-be blockbuster for only half the potential audience, according to a person familiar with their thinking.Read more: James Bond sequel delayed till NovemberMore films may get pushed back as well, with the hope that coronavirus fears subside in a few months. But no one can predict how soon government restrictions will be lifted or when moviegoers will be comfortable sitting in a crowded theater.The Bond delay and the prospect of further disruptions sent movie-theater stocks reeling. The largest U.S. exhibitor, AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc., fell as much as 10% in New York trading Thursday. Shares of the U.K.’s Cineworld Group Plc, which owns the Regal chain in the U.S., plunged as much as 24%, the most on record.“The thing that’s scary about the coronavirus today is that we don’t know the extent of it,” said Jason Squire, a professor at the USC School of Cinematic Arts and editor of “The Movie Business Book.” In Los Angeles alone, six new cases were identified within a week of expanding testing criteria. City and county officials said they are preparing for more infected patients to pop up.In the meantime, filming delays can cost $1 million a day, Squire said. Festivals and press events, including the unveiling of Disney+ in Europe, also have been canceled. Apple Inc. said Wednesday that it wouldn’t be participating in the South by Southwest film and technology festival in Austin, Texas, where it had been planning to show new programming for its TV+ platform. Netflix Inc. also is pulling out, a spokesperson said late Wednesday.Read more: Apple cancels South by Southwest appearanceProduction problems also are now rippling through the TV industry.“The Bachelorette” -- a reality dating show that’s meant to offer an escape from any concerns of consequence -- isn’t immune. The program’s new lead will no longer be courted by her male suitors in Italy next season, veering from original production plans. The country has been in lockdown after facing a spike in coronavirus cases that started in late February.Hollywood film productions are meticulously planned, making it all the more painful when things go awry.Every hour of every day is scheduled, and there are complex tasks like shutting down city blocks, doling out pay to dozens or hundreds of crew members, and ensuring mega-props -- say, a yacht -- are available, said Tyler Thompson, a producer and president of Cross Creek Pictures who worked with Tom Cruise on his 2017 film “American Made.”While studios are used to dealing with emergencies, particularly weather-related ones, an illness that keeps jumping to new parts of the world is unusual.With “Mission: Impossible,” a series that features Cruise as both a producer and leading man, the sets and props are particularly ambitious.For the seventh installment, slated for release in 2021, workers were building a replica of the Gritti hotel to use in filming. It’s now gathering dust. And the crew that had descended on the Italian city earlier this month is in limbo.A view of the “Ruga Vechia“, a street where the shooting of “Mission: Impossible 7” was supposed to take place.PHOTOGRAPHER: ANNETTE REUTHER/DPA/PICTURE ALLIANCE VIA GETTY IMAGES“They told us to pack our equipment and to leave ASAP,” Arianna Pascazi, a scene artist from Rome, said by phone. “They told us to leave some of the scenes already made here, but to be honest, we don’t know if we will come back at all.”Pascazi had just started to paint stained-glass pieces in the windows of faux buildings for the backdrop of the film’s action sequences.Elsewhere, filmmakers fear their work may not find distributors with this cloud hanging over the industry.That includes Heather Ross, whose documentary, “For Madmen Only,” is set to premiere March 15 at the South by Southwest festival. Conference participants, such as Apple, Netflix, Amazon.com Inc., Facebook Inc. and Twitter Inc., have pulled out, and a petition with more than 45,000 signatures is urging organizers to call off the event to protect against the spread of the disease.Festival management have said they have no plans to cancel the show and are following guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Ross said she and a small crew have been working around the clock to prepare her documentary for the premiere. It’s an opportunity to get the movie in front of studios, which may be interested in purchasing it.Read more: Movie theaters can’t afford a pandemic (Opinion)“We worked on this documentary for six years and haven’t slept in about three weeks in order to make the film perfect for its debut,” she said. “We’re lighting candles to various gods and deities.”Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at the Box Office Co., expects studios and organizers of big events to stay cautious. The Bond delay “sets a precedent,” he said.“In terms of productions that are putting a pause on things, it’s the smart decision to make at this point,” Robbins said. “As much as we want to see these films get made, the No. 1 priority is getting the world through this health crisis right now.”— With assistance by Christopher Palmeri'),\n",

       "  'Cocomelon videos get 2.5 billion views a month, and toddler superfans will soon have toys and albums they can buy.Jay Jeon is an unassuming mogul. No one takes notice of him as he slips into the corner booth at the Italian steakhouse steps from his Orange County office on a sunny Friday. Most any toddler who knew what the trim, soft-spoken 55-year-old does, however, would have gone nuts. Jeon runs Cocomelon, a YouTube channel dedicated to nursery rhymes and original songs, whose animated kids and creatures generate about 2.5 billion views in a typical month. That translates into as much as $11.3 million in monthly ad revenue, according to estimates from industry analyst Social Blade. In terms of viewership, an average Cocomelon video dwarfs the turnout for most of the world’s sports leagues, pop stars, and scripted TV. It’s the second-most-watched YouTube channel, trailing only T-Series, India’s music king.Cocomelon’s success has caught everyone off guard, including Jeon. For more than a decade, he and his wife ran their channel more or less by themselves, and he was happy that way. The steakhouse meeting is his first press interview ever, and one condition was that he not be photographed, for fear of paparazzi. Another: His wife was not to be named or discussed. Even the couple’s neighbors don’t know which channel they run. “Nobody knows me,” Jeon says between bites of pasta. “I really like that.” He owns 100% of Treasure Studio Inc., which controls Cocomelon, and for years he and his wife have rejected investors, sponsors, and demands to translate the cartoons into other languages, make sequels to big hits, or roll out plush toys based on the characters.Now, however, the Jeons and their team of about 20 employees are ready to merchandise. Their first forays beyond YouTube include albums of the channel’s popular songs and, later this year, Cocomelon toys, made by Jazwares, known for its Cabbage Patch Kids and Pokémon dolls. Jeon says he’s also thinking about ways to develop a full-length theatrical movie based on the show. (In a normal week, Cocomelon uploads one original video that’s a few minutes long, plus a longer compilation of old footage.)Figures as of Feb. 7.Data: Social BladeDiversification is becoming more important for YouTube stars, especially those with young audiences, because the formula that fueled Cocomelon’s success is changing. YouTube still sells ads against videos, but in January it had to stop using kid-focused clips to sell more profitable targeted ads, which are personalized to each viewer’s browsing history. This change, along with a $170 million fine, was part of YouTube’s September deal with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission to settle charges that it routinely built behavioral profiles on kids younger than 13, flagrantly violating the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act. (In another condition of the settlement, the company neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing.) YouTube says it’s taking more steps to address the concerns, including limits on ad personalization.Since the change, the top kids’ channels have lost 50% to 60% of their ad sales, according to Chris Williams, who runs the kids’ media company PocketWatch. Jeon says his channel’s ad revenue has declined, but wouldn’t say how much, or whether he believes YouTube is a trustworthy conduit for kids’ programming. He praises the site for helping people tell stories that otherwise might go untold. Still, his company’s new ventures speak to a shift away from a YouTube-only business model among even the channel’s most popular creators. Each new Cocomelon video now takes about two months to produce. The need and potential to expand into other arenas has become obvious, says Williams, who’s helped at least one young star get a show on Nickelodeon and a line of merch sold in Walmarts. “Look at the universe of YouTube channels, consumer products, premium series, live events,” he says. “I see a big opportunity.”Jeon moved to Los Angeles from South Korea in the mid-1990s and got into commercial directing after studying film at a local arts school. He and his wife, a children’s book author, began making short cartoons to accompany kids’ songs about a decade later to entertain their two young sons. When they showed some of the clips to friends from church, one of them suggested the couple post them on YouTube, then brand-new. The Jeons posted their first video, under the account ABCKidTV, a month before Google acquired the website in 2006.Even after their own kids outgrew the videos, the couple kept making them as a creative outlet. For years, ABCKidTV posted classic singalongs like The Alphabet Song and Wheels on the Bus. Over the years, viewership steadily rose, and at some point—Jeon forgets exactly when—he started earning enough from YouTube ads to quit his day job and hire animators and songwriters. In early 2017 a buoyant animated toddler named J.J. began to star in most of the videos, joined later by his mom and dad and a sea of animal friends. J.J.’s family is white, and his parents play traditional roles, with Mom doing most of the parenting and chores and Dad popping in every so often.Then, suddenly, everything changed. In the fall of 2017, after the team had begun producing cartoons with 3D-rendered characters, monthly views nearly doubled, to about 238 million, in a matter of two months, according to Tubular Labs Inc., a market researcher. In 2018, Jeon picked a new channel name, an amalgamation of coconut and watermelon. “It’s kid-friendly,” he says. “Sweet.” By the end of that year, monthly views totaled about 2 billion. Cocomelon’s most popular video, a Baby Shark riff called Bath Song (“Wash my hair, doo doo doo doo doo doo”), has been viewed more than 2.3 billion times. “It’s just a staggering number,” says Patrick Reese, an executive at Fullscreen, Jeon’s manager. Reese scours YouTube for copycat channels that blatantly upload Cocomelon’s videos as their own.Most of the cartoons don’t exactly have the same educational value as one of the better segments of Sesame Street, but the Jeons are hardly responsible for YouTube raising a generation of children. The fig leaf maintained by YouTube and its parent, Google—that YouTube isn’t for kids, and kids don’t use it—has been ridiculous on its face for years. (The company says its terms of service bar kids under 13 from having accounts.) The audience for Cocomelon, which has blown far past those of the Disney Channel, Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, and whichever episodes of Sesame Street remain outside the HBO paywall, is a testament to that. Jeon’s channel drew an appreciable percentage of the roughly $8 billion YouTube handed out to video creators last year.Cocomelon has become the most visible face of the YouTube cartoon industry, which includes a sea of anonymous animated content farms that have occasionally scandalized the video site over the past few years. Critics say the channel’s success is less a function of its material than its savvy manipulation of YouTube’s recommendation system. The channel’s rise to superstardom coincides with its use of the search tag “no no baby,” which in late 2017 was also associated with a steady stream of superviral videos, usually of a stubborn child learning to do household tasks. (“No no baby” had recently replaced “bad baby,” a search term that had been co-opted by a series of nightmarish clips of infants hurling food and screaming in terror.) “These are all great keywords, but show me the educators behind it,” says Steven Wolfe Pereira, chief executive officer of the small, kids-focused Encantos Media.Jeon says he’s a storyteller, not an expert in search engine optimization. “I never look up the reason why something is popular or how I can please the YouTube algorithm,” he says. “I know what matters. Stories matter.” Future Cocomelon cartoons, developed in consultation with educators, will bring J.J. to school, he says, and diversify the channel’s cast.Whatever the future holds for J.J., his hit songs are sure to become required listening on a great many family car trips as Cocomelon’s albums begin to sell. With his anonymity mostly intact, Jeon doesn’t have to worry much about moms and dads who’ve heard Bath Song for the thousandth time complaining to him on the street. And if that air of mystery turns some people off, that’s OK. “I don’t want more viewership,” he says. “I’m fine.”\\n \\nRead more: How Google’s Ad Ecosystem Works'),\n",

       "  \"Breaking down the boldest bets in businessFor your consideration, it’s $11,000 per voter.That’s the back-of-the-napkin breakdown of how much Netflix reportedly spent on its Academy Award lobbying (though Netflix says the undisclosed amount is lower). A big, splashy Oscar PR blitz is a Hollywood tradition, but by all accounts, it’s a silly exercise. Academy membership is tough to parse and most delegates only vote on certain categories. Trying to sway the arcane process behind tonight’s awards in any particular direction is about as savvy and scientific as betting on greyhounds.For Netflix, however, the math is different. The equation has an extra variable or two and the decimal points tends to drift to the east. Oscar advertising for the streaming giant is still additive for its platform, and will likely continue to be as long as a Netflix nomination is a somewhat novel thing. This year, Netflix is up for 24 statues, more than any of its movie-making rivals. When a film like Roma is nominated for an Oscar and Netflix makes sure people know about it, the company wins curious subscribers, who, in turn, are more likely to queue up The Irishman, Marriage Story or the other five Netflix films on the ballot this year.Other studios aren’t so lucky. A fan of Little Women, for example, probably isn’t any more inclined to see Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Pain and Glory or any of the other Sony flicks in the running. As a consultant from central casting might say: there are no synergies.The payoff for Hollywood incumbents is the box-office bump a movie enjoys after winning, and the higher value it eventually commands when its rights are sold to Netflix or some other streaming platform. Streaming, however, has dragged down the value of an Oscar triumph. Late-comers are less likely to scurry out and catch a Best Picture at the theater when they know it can be screened from their couch.Oscar advertising isn’t a zero-sum game, but it’s close. There are only so many private screenings and local TV slots to go around, particularly in the tiny window between when the nominations drop and when the envelopes are opened. Netflix is forcing its rivals to spend more to stay in the spotlight, which leaves just a little bit less to splash around on other things like, say, producing a great film or landing an Oscar-winning director.It’s also popcorn money in the Netflix ecosystem. All told, about 13 percent of Netflix revenue goes to marketing, a little more than half the share at Lions Gate, the closest thing to a pure-play, old-school movie studio. Of course, at Lions Gate that line item also has to cover distribution, which Netflix doesn't much worry about. And while Disney doubles down on men in tights and wonders how much fuel is left in its Star Wars vehicle, Netflix is free to green-light more original, wide-ranging stuff, including actors and directors' pet projects. Not only will it pay for them; it will promote them heavily every February. “Think of all of our awards work as a really smart way to make us the best home for talent in the world,” CEO Reed Hastings told analysts on a recent conference call. “The business benefit is that we will win deals that we wouldn’t have otherwise.”Perhaps, the Best Picture of 2020 … or 2022 for that matter.\"),\n",

       "  '2020-02-07',\n",
       "  'Blockbusters like Avengers: Endgame are setting new records, while movie tickets sold per person have hit a 92-year low.When Hollywood celebrates the 92nd Academy Awards on Feb. 9, one “winner” won’t be celebrated: the box office. Global theatrical receipts hit a new peak in 2019 of $42.5 billion, according to Comscore Inc., and Avengers: Endgame became the top-grossing movie of all time. Yet the number of tickets sold per person in the U.S. also hit a 92-year low.In 2019 the average American visited a movie theater fewer than three and a half times, a third less than the peak in 2002. The last time attendance was this low was due to a smaller number of theaters and films, not because of audience interest. Today, there are 44,400 screens in the U.S., up 16% since 2000. There are also more annual releases than ever before: almost 800, more than twice as many as in 2000.U.S. and CanadaData: Box Office Mojo, Bureau of Labor & Statistics, StatsCan, MPA, Harold Vogel, Matthew BallThe greatest declines have come from the most active moviegoers. A decade ago, the 12- to 24-year-old age group went to almost eight films a year. Today, this same demographic sees fewer than five annually. In the early 2000s, 28% of Americans attended more than 12 films per year. Today, only 12% do.Some commentators, filmmakers and critics among them, have argued that Hollywood’s focus on blockbusters has left many moviegoers with few other films to watch in theaters. However, a greater share of the American population goes to at least one movie each year than it did a decade ago—75% vs. 70%, according to the Motion Picture Association. And half of the decline in moviegoing came before Hollywood’s shift to such films. The Marvel Cinematic Universe arrived only in 2008, for instance, while Pixar’s second-ever sequel was released in 2010, more than a decade after its first.U.S. and CanadaData: Box Office Mojo, Matthew BallIn fact, almost all of the drop in moviegoing over the past 20 years has come on the indie side of the box office. The top 25 titles per year, which represent about 50% of annual grosses and are, by definition, mostly blockbusters, sell the same number of tickets per capita as they used to. This is despite the fact that the number of true independent films produced each year now exceeds 725, up from an average of 135 in the 1990s.The drop in attendance isn’t a pricing issue, either. The cost of a ticket has gone up only a dollar in inflation-adjusted terms since 2000–or 13%–and is roughly in line with prices from the late 1980s. With IMAX, 3D, and VIP seating, audiences get a better experience than they ever did. And if pricing were really pushing those who attended more than 12 movies a year to cut back, we would have seen all-you-can-watch subscriptions such MoviePass and AMC Stubs reverse declining ticket sales.Data: Box Office Mojo, Matthew BallIncludes Disney, Warner Bros, Fox, Universal, Sony, Paramount, and Lionsgate. Fox and Disney, which merged in 2019, are counted separately. Disney, which controls more than 30% of the box office, has two extra franchise slots, one from both Paramount and Lionsgate.The challenge is more fundamental: The role of the movie theater has changed. What used to be a forum for all types of art is now largely the domain of “theme park movies”—Avengers: Endgame or Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker—and “museum pieces,” such as 1917 or Get Out. And audiences have ruthlessly high thresholds for both.Some defenders of so-called auteur cinema believe the box office hasn’t been transformed. Instead, they argue, we are just in the midst of a temporary obsession with superheroes and space operas—and, as was the case with Westerns, these genres will grow less popular. But this isn’t a great historical example. In the 30 years known for producing “classic” Westerns, 1939-1969, only 14 of 300 ever cracked the top 10 at the domestic box office. Only two years had two Western films in the top 10. In 2017, 2018, and 2019, films based on Marvel, DC, or Star Wars characters have averaged 5.5 films in the top 10. Most of the remainder are films such as Fast & The Furious sequels, Toy Story 4, and Despicable Me 3, with an occasional outlier like Bohemian Rhapsody.The transformation of the movie theater has a clear precedent. Prior to the advent of television, theaters were where we watched any and all video, newsreel included, with the average number of visits ranking as high as 45 trips per year. In 2019 we had more news video than ever before—and none of it is consumed in a theater. The same is now happening with most types of films.It’s wrong to think that any of these realities are “bad” for cinema. Demand for and consumption of movies—all movies—has increased over the past 20 years. And thanks to on-demand services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, it’s now easier and cheaper than ever to watch these films. Of course, this will inevitably change what’s available in theaters, hence why the great House of Mouse has started shifting some of its theatrical releases to stream as Disney+ exclusives.The movie business is judged at the box office, not this weekend’s Oscars—so what we’ll see in theaters will look more like who wins the former than the latter. More so each year.\\n \\nMatthew Ball is a venture capitalist, media analyst, and the former head of strategy at Amazon Studios.'),\n",

       "  '2019-12-20',\n",
       "  'From 1929 to 2019, we’ve reported on everything from World War II to WeWork.The first issue of this magazine appeared on Sept. 7, 1929. Its black, red, and gold art deco cover was free of news. It featured a big triangle pointing down at an inscrutable photo—an overhead, nighttime view of an intersection in an unidentified big city.The editors obviously had no way to know that seven weeks later the stock market would crash, ushering in the Great Depression. They did observe that “the market is now almost wholly ‘psychological’—irregular, unsteady, and properly apprehensive of the inevitable readjustment that draws near.” But in the metaphorical style of the day, they also said, “There is no financial frost in the air as yet, and we look for a long stretch of Indian summer in industry before winter sets in.” The first issue carried squibs on tariffs, railroads, farms, Palestine, and even this tech breakthrough: “Dry Ice Finds Many New Uses.”How we’ve survived, thrived, and evolved from 1929 to 2019 is a sprawling tale. We’ve been shaped by each of the thousands of journalists who’ve worked here over the past nine decades, sweating every sentence, photograph, illustration, chart, and cover. We’ve also been shaped by every story we’ve done, from World War II to WeWork. We are 90 years old but still a perpetual newborn, created anew each week.To say “we” is presumptuous of today’s staff, since of course no one from 1929 is here anymore. On the other hand, there’s institutional memory. Jim Ellis, the editor of our Business section and one of the authors of this essay, has been with the magazine since 1980. He overlapped for a few years with John Cobbs, who started in 1942. Cobbs in turn overlapped with Ralph Smith, editor from 1937 to 1949, who’d been with The Business Week from its beginning. So, just three people span our entire history.We’ve been through a lot of changes, right down to our name: first The Business Week, then Business Week, then BUSINESS WEEK, then BusinessWeek. And since 2009, Bloomberg Businessweek, as part of Bloomberg LP, which acquired us from the McGraw-Hill Cos.Our decade inside Bloomberg is an echo of our eight inside McGraw-Hill. At “Mother McGraw,” BusinessWeek was the flagship publication, drawing on reporting from a network of specialty trade publications ranging from Modern Plastics to Engineering News-Record. At Bloomberg, the magazine’s staff harnesses its 2,700-plus journalists and analysts, who work in 120 countries.Something else has persisted: our mission. “Its ambition is to become indispensable,” the editors wrote in the inaugural issue. “The Business Week never will be content to be a mere chronicle of events. It aims always to interpret their significance.” That promise stands up pretty well today, as does our determination to serve you, our reader. If nothing else, our longevity suggests we’ve been doing something right on that score.Not that we’re always on the money. Even in the magazine’s earliest days, the editors were slow to realize the economic carnage that was transpiring. As late as July 1930 we were still optimistically pointing to “a fistful of straw that show business winds have turned,” including record June sales of Packard automobiles. McGraw-Hill went ahead with plans for a blue-green art deco headquarters on Manhattan’s 42nd Street, moving into it in late 1931. (The landmarked building still stands, though it’s half-enveloped by the Port Authority Bus Terminal.)But as the Depression gathered force, the editors turned into strong advocates for aggressive action to revive the U.S. economy. At a time when the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and others urged the federal government to balance its budget, The Business Week understood that the economy was suffering from a shortage of demand and that government was the only player capable of filling the gap. In October 1930 the magazine complained that the Federal Reserve was “standing idly by.” In March 1932 we condemned a consumption tax bill in the House as “fiscal suicide” that would cause “further deflation and contraction.”It was one of the magazine’s finest hours. “Business Week’s editorials offered perhaps the most sophisticated Keynesian-style economic analysis of any mass publication, and its influence may have been disproportionate to its circulation, as it targeted an elite audience of businessmen,” wrote Ranjit Dighe, an economics professor at the State University of New York at Oswego, in a 2011 paper.The probable author of those editorials, Virgil Jordan, was the first in a long line of brilliant economists and economic journalists to write for the magazine. Another was Leonard Silk, Ph.D., later a columnist for the New York Times, who wrote for the magazine from 1954 to 1969. Silk attempted to bolster readers’ trust in economists, writing in 1959 that the profession “has moved a long way toward the realism and practicality sought by business and government.” Silk hired William Wolman, a Stanford Ph.D. who continued to write and edit for the magazine until 2001. Wolman in turn hired Michael Mandel, a Harvard Ph.D. who became a theorist of the New Economy and stayed with the magazine until 2009.Aside from chronicling the lousy economy, the Business Week of the 1930s helped invent the modern role of the chief executive officer. Writing about management became a staple of the magazine as the postwar explosion of new businesses and technologies called for a shift toward professional managers who had the analytical skills to quickly assume responsibility in unfamiliar enterprises. The archetype of this new ubermanager was General Motors CEO Alfred P. Sloan, whose data-driven approach became one of the most influential business strategies of the 1950s.Sloan in 1950 donated more than $5 million to launch the graduate business school at MIT, back when formal management education was a novelty. Business Week was quick to recognize the huge importance of the shift. From the article “Can You Teach Management?” in April 1952: “The day of the truly professional general management man isn’t here yet, but it’s not far away.” (The acceptance of professional women managers would take quite a bit longer.) Indeed, the rise in incomes and the amount of leisure time enjoyed by an increasingly suburban middle class meant money was to be made in new industries such as entertainment and travel, and professional managers-without-portfolio became a prized commodity. The magazine would play a modest part in their development, especially after the introduction of our annual business school ranking in 1988.Business Week’s coverage continued to evolve. A November 1951 issue examined the potential impact of color television. In August 1952 the headline of the magazine’s cover story on the airline industry’s plan to shift to jets asked, “How Big Can It Get?” A July 1955 cover story detailed the $17 million—yes, $17 million—bet Walt Disney Productions was taking to open the original Disneyland in Anaheim, Calif.And an August 1958 cover story predicted that American Express Co.’s new national credit card would be “perhaps the closest thing yet to a ‘universal’ card adequate for all the needs of a traveler or stay-at-home host.” That was almost a decade before BankAmericard (now Visa) expanded outside California and the founding of Master Charge (now Mastercard), but Business Week readers were already well aware of the potential for plastic to change American consumption forever.Meanwhile, our writers and editors increasingly spent time tracking broader societal shifts that would have an indelible impact on business. One of the most striking was the inclusion of women. The magazine had put a group of female workers on its cover in May 1942 to illustrate the phenomenon of women entering the workforce to fill in for men during World War II. Soon a few female entrepreneurs would appear on the cover, starting with Hazel Bishop, the chemist-turned-businesswoman who developed the first nonsmearable lipstick, in 1951 and Tupperware saleswoman Brownie Wise three years later.Then came our 1975 cover “The Corporate Woman: Up the Ladder, Finally,” showing a confident General Electric Co. vice president, Marion Kellogg, seated in a black chair. The 11-page package by our Corporate Women department editors provided an inside look at the discrimination and slights, overt and subtle, that women experienced as they climbed the ranks in male-dominated businesses. “In situations where men say, ‘This is what I want and deserve’ and get a yes or no, a woman’s requests are treated as demands,” Sandra Kresch, then a 30-year-old vice president at consultant Booz Allen & Hamilton, told us. “People are surprised and ask, ‘Why is she such a hard-driving lady?’\\u200a” And there was the male executive who said many women weren’t willing to make the sacrifices of working extra hours or accepting the tension that comes with being a senior manager. There were also encouraging signs of progress. “The big news is that women are making headway—slowly in the executive suite, faster at the lower rungs of middle management.”Business Week’s coverage of African Americans’ movement within corporations followed a similar fringe-to-mainstream arc. In the early days, coverage of black business was scant, and the magazine was at times painfully in step with the segregationist thinking of the era. A December 1944 story, “Negro Problem Worries Coast,” said California cities were troubled by the large numbers of black workers who’d moved west to work in war plants and planned to stay: “There are Negroes who despise their ‘ghetto’ and others who like it—and profit by it,” the story said.In the 1960s, the civil rights movement and nationwide unrest cast a harsh light on the inequity of the American dream. Business Week changed alongside America’s racial dialogue, publishing stories throughout the decade about government efforts to jump-start black capitalism—seen by some policymakers as a way to calm frustrated demonstrators who’d taken to the streets—and profiles of nascent black businesses. The magazine’s tone remained a work in progress: An April 1969 marketing story noted that “Negro-owned, operated American Dream Soap hopes to clean up with products aimed for the ghetto.”By the time Business Week published a September 1973 article about George E. Johnson and the success of his Chicago-based hair-care company, Johnson Products (headline: “When Black Is Beautiful”), the editors seemed intent on being more inclusive. Still, they were writing for an audience that was far from woke about the black experience. So when they quoted Johnson, whose company made Afro Sheen, joking, “I’d be shaking in my boots” if more blacks began adopting the hairstyle sported by singer Isaac Hayes Jr., Business Week had to explain to its mostly white readers: “Hayes is bald.”Change happens only so fast, however. When a Xerox Corp. executive, A. Barry Rand, was interviewed in 1988 for our cover story “The Black Middle Class,” he was quick to note that discrimination wasn’t going away. “\\u2009‘The playing field has not been leveled,’ argues Xerox’s Rand, who runs a $4 billion unit with 30,000 employees. ‘America is not color-blind. Race still matters.’\\u2009” Rand, who left Xerox in 1999 to become CEO of Avis and later served as CEO of AARP before his death last year, could have said the same today.While the 1960s and ’70s expanded the economic pie and gave many people a political voice, the 1980s seemed to move in the opposite direction. Dozens of fights for corporate control were waged by a new class of business boogeyman or shareholder savior, depending on where you sat. These were “The Raiders”—junk-bond financiers and leveraged buyout kings—whom we personified with a March 1985 cover showing a pinstripe-suited executive wearing a red bandanna.The 1988 fight over RJR Nabisco Inc. was era-defining. Henry Kravis’s buyout firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. mounted a $25 billion hostile takeover of the tobacco and food giant, then led by a cocksure F. Ross Johnson, who’d tried to take the company private in a sweetheart deal. KKR financed its counteroffer largely by borrowing against the company’s assets, putting a little-known financial tactic known as the leveraged buyout on the map. Kravis landed on the Nov. 14, 1988, cover as “King Henry.”Possibly the most iconic character of the 1980s was Michael Milken, the wunderkind who led the junk-bond team at investment bank Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. “Milken has devoted his career to a radical proposition: that the supposedly risky bonds of companies with low credit ratings actually are terrific investments. So far, he’s been right,” we wrote in 1985. (Many of his clients also became iconic figures, such as oilman T. Boone Pickens, casino operator Steve Wynn, and CNN founder Ted Turner.) Yet Milken’s decade-long run as the most feared person in corporate boardrooms came to an end when he pleaded guilty to securities fraud, served 22 months in prison, and was barred for life from the securities business.Elsewhere on Wall Street, Michael Bloomberg was “stirring up trouble,” BusinessWeek wrote in its April 29, 1991, issue—the first time the magazine covered its future owner, whose namesake financial information service already had “estimated” sales of $140 million as well as some formidable competitors. “In contrast with his company’s modest size,” we wrote, “Bloomberg’s aspirations might strike some as grandiose.” And how about this kicker: “Bloomberg has already shown plenty of guts. Glory of the sort he craves may take a little longer.”Bloomberg’s data wasn’t the only thing changing Wall Street. With the end of fixed brokerage commissions in 1975, retail investors, driven by the replacement of traditional corporate pensions with self-directed 401(k) retirement plans, had become a phenomenon by the mid-’80s. The institutional investor “buy side” could finally go toe-to-toe with Wall Street’s “sell side.”Online discount brokerages appeared, and mutual funds boomed. Charles Schwab Corp., through shrewd marketing and innovative technology, “lays out a sumptuous banquet of low-cost and imaginative investment programs, such as no-fee mutual funds, computerized stock trading, and specialized banking services,” said a Dec. 19, 1994, cover story.Consumer advocacy groups would also come into their own, many of them founded by “Naderites,” people inspired by Ralph Nader’s indictment of the auto industry in 1965’s Unsafe at Any Speed. These advocates became the moral conscience of corporations, whether said corporations liked it or not. Meanwhile, environmentalism came of age with the passage of the Clean Air Act in 1990, forged by deals between congressional Democrats, who “don’t want to face the voters empty-handed” in an election year, and a Republican president, George H.W. Bush, who “wants to burnish his reputation as an environmentalist,” according to a March 5, 1990, story. How times have changed.And yet, not. History does seem to repeat itself. As the magazine wrote just a few issues ago, 2020 could be “the year of the great antitrust reawakening.” If so, it would arrive 36 years after the breakup of American Telephone & Telegraph Co. The U.S. had brought an antitrust case claiming that Ma Bell had abused its monopoly over long-distance service and equipment. After a decade-long court battle, AT&T agreed to settle the case by spinning off the regional telephone companies, the seven Baby Bells, in 1984.The magazine closely chronicled how that breakup brought chaos yet paved the way for young visionaries who foresaw how the telephone could provide voice, video, and data in one handset. Fifteen years later, a Nov. 22, 1999, article said “companies created out of the Bell System, including those since swallowed up, are worth about $810 billion today, vs. $59 billion before the breakup.”The telecom upheaval would soon mesh with the digital revolution. The same year as Ma Bell’s dissolution, a 28-year-old Steve Jobs would introduce the Apple Macintosh personal computer. “Stores cannot keep Macintosh in stock; the waiting lists of eager customers are growing at many retailers,” the magazine wrote in March 1984.During Ronald Reagan’s presidency, “deregulation” and “tax cuts” were the watchwords. This lured many companies for the first time to open lobby shops and make campaign contributions to influence legislation and policy. BusinessWeek in 1985 also opened its first dedicated Washington bureau—just in time, too. A savings and loan scandal erupted out of a soupçon of regulatory failures, legislative bloopers, and unchecked campaign contributions. The fallout lasted to 1995 and involved the closure of some 800 S&Ls at a cost to taxpayers of about $125 billion.That debacle fed a disenchantment with Washington that, by late 1992, had “deteriorated into something more malignant—a deep-seated loathing,” the magazine wrote, hitting an all-too-familiar theme. “The public seems to distrust all politicians and is determined to shake up the established order.” Sometimes, nothing seems to change.The heady American economy also powered through a scary stock market crash on Black Monday in October 1987, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 23%. The culprit would prove to be so-called portfolio insurance, which institutional investors had purchased to protect the value of the stocks in their portfolios. “The problem,” as a Nov. 9, 1987, cover story put it, “is that these markets were not designed for the large institutions, which now dominate trading—especially when they all want to sell at the same time.” Fortunately the stock market quickly recovered and continued its upward march, defying our infamous “Death of Equities” cover from 1979. (Oops.)Perhaps the most consequential development of the ’80s and ’90s was the export of American-style capitalism around the globe. BusinessWeek’s European and Asian editions thrived on tales of peripatetic executives taking advantage of market-opening trade deals, delivering the message that free markets would yield good-paying jobs and higher living standards. The failure of communism as an economic and social model, made official by the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, gave U.S. companies a license to plant their flag in dozens of countries around the world. “New markets, rapid advances in communications, and new sources of brainpower and skilled labor are forcing businesses into their most fundamental reorganization since the multi-division corporation became standard in the 1950s,” a Nov. 18, 1994, cover story said.The U.S. economy entered and exited the 1990s with the wind at its back, interrupted by a brief recession in 1990-91, a brief war in the Persian Gulf in 1991, and not-so-brief spurts of corporate restructurings, downsizings, and mergers. The nascent digital revolution combined with healthy consumer spending, receding unemployment, and low inflation to produce what analysts called a Goldilocks economy. Foreign investors flocked to America. The European Union, partly in an attempt to mimic U.S. success, introduced the euro, its single currency. As the 21st century dawned, BusinessWeek sought to capture the new American prosperity and self-assuredness with a Feb. 14, 2000, cover story. It was titled, simply, “Boom.”Unfortunately, as in 1929, our timing wasn’t so great: The dot-com bubble popped less than a month later. After a disastrous February initial public offering, Pets.com and its canine Sock Puppet mascot became memorable early casualties. By December, our body count was 75 “e-tailers.” (One noteworthy exception was Amazon.com Inc. Jeff Bezos, we wrote that May, “isn’t letting all the hand-wringing about Amazon’s high-risk strategy get him down.”) By the end of the year, the stock market had dropped almost 14% from its peak in March—and it had much further to fall, though there would be no moment lower than the tragedy of Sept. 11, 2001.Yet barely a month after the Twin Towers fell, Jobs introduced the iPod, the digital music player that put thousands of songs in your pocket and synced with a computer program called iTunes, and Apple Computer Inc., whose shares were just $1.30 at the time, began its epic ascent. For a world still smoldering, here was a ray of hope, courtesy of a mock-turtlenecked entrepreneur-aesthete who knew a few things about second acts.What followed is the stuff of legend: from iPod Shuffles to iPhones, Apple Stores to App Stores, Apple Watches to Apple TVs, Apple AirPods to, well, Apple AirPods Pro. “Jobs and his lieutenants parlayed their uncommon obsession with design and ease of use into an historic run,” Bloomberg’s Brad Stone wrote when Apple—by now just Apple Inc.—became the first U.S. company to pass a $1 trillion market capitalization in August 2018. (Another cover that makes us wince today: “The Fall of an American Icon,” about Apple in 1996.)It’s easy to overlook the feat now, but the incredible evolution of technology since just the turn of this century has, in its finest moments, produced wonder. It’s also produced anger, especially in the midst of Lehman Brothers’ implosion and the ensuing financial crisis, which happened to hit especially close to home for the magazine. As we were to learn, Standard & Poor’s was an enabler of the carnage that transpired and, like BusinessWeek, the rating company also happened to be a unit of McGraw-Hill. As our longtime owner’s business turned dire, BusinessWeek changed hands—and proceeded to reinvent itself for the times with a dramatic redesign, becoming an early iteration of the magazine we are today.From the beginning, Businessweek has covered the entire world. The earliest issues in 1929 warned that European employers were looking askance at Henry Ford’s wage theories. The magazine covered the devastation of World War II and the miraculous postwar economic recoveries. It probed business opportunities in Latin America, Africa, and across Asia. It documented the rise of Japan and the even more dramatic rise of China. Hong Kong correspondent Joyce Barnathan and her co-authors even issued a prescient warning in “Rethinking China,” a March 4, 1996, cover story. “A pattern of disturbing behavior—from saber-rattling over Taiwan to strong-arming Western business—is causing concern about China’s swiftly growing power,” the subhead read.Having lived through a few decades, we’ve seen bull markets like the present one before and know that, at some point it will end and, as we wrote last year, “we’ll start by describing its demise”—the crash of 2020-something. Or maybe we’ll get really lucky, like the Australians, who’ve been waiting 30 years for the next recession. But we digress. (At 90, I guess we are allowed to.)What’s really been flowing through our veins all these decades, and something that’s defined our coverage since the beginning of this century—especially during our time as Bloomberg Businessweek—is an obsession with innovation and change. It’s why “Sooner Than You Think” became one of our favorite franchises, why our Emmy-nominated video series Hello World gets millions of hits on YouTube, and why we memorialized Jobs with a special ad-free issue upon his death. Ideas and insights—that’s our currency.The magazine has obviously long covered founders and CEOs, executives and management, industries and products. We’ve divided the staff into beats, and “the book” into corresponding sections. All of that was to organize the news, to tame the torrent of the times. We’re first and foremost a U.S. magazine, yet we’ve also broadened ourselves into a global business publication, one with an American perspective that makes use of Bloomberg LP’s best assets: valuable data and talented people. Beyond the print magazine, we’re a big part of bloomberg.com; we also produce a TV show, a radio show, and a podcast; and we have millions of followers on social media.We know we’ve been fortunate to live as long as we have. Which is why we want to say thank you—to you, our readers, as well as our staffers, contributors, advertisers, and anybody else we’ve ever touched. We value you and the time you give us, and we look forward to engaging with you for many more issues in the decades to come. '),\n",

       "  '2019-12-13',\n",
       "  'Streaming giants are struggling with a big churn conundrum: Only a third of users stick around.Walt Disney Co.’s new streaming service, Disney+, signed up 10 million customers last month, well ahead of expectations. And it’s got a buzzy show with the Star Wars spinoff The Mandalorian. Now the world’s largest entertainment company has to figure out how to keep people from canceling the service after that series’ season finale on Dec. 27 or when their free trials expire.Everyone wants to be the next Netflix Inc., with its 158 million customers worldwide. In addition to Disney, Apple has introduced its own streaming service, and Comcast and AT&T are set to follow early next year. But such services have some of the highest cancellation rates among subscription-based businesses, according to Recurly, which provides billing assistance to the industry.Only about a third of customers stick around after free trials run out, and roughly 10% of members quit video streaming services monthly—twice the rate for games, music, and other entertainment. “There’s a learning curve,” says Dan Burkhart, Recurly’s chief executive officer. “Some of these large organizations are going to have to learn how to deal with data, and [then] putting it into practice requires time.”Free trials are a big part of the marketing push. Apple Inc. is giving away Apple TV+ for a year to anyone who buys a new device. Disney formed a partnership with Verizon Communications Inc. to offer a free year of Disney+ to 17 million of Verizon’s higher-end phone and internet customers. Businesses are also offering multiservice discounts. Disney charges $13 a month for Hulu, Disney+, and ESPN+ (Disney+ alone runs $7); CBS All Access and Showtime are bundled at a discount, too. This largesse has led some investors to wonder if free is the right strategy. “Are these offers eroding customers’ willingness to pay for content in the long term?” research firm MoffettNathanson asked in a note this month.The experience of an early adopter of the direct-to-consumer subscription model, World Wrestling Entertainment Inc., provides an answer. It started its $10-a-month WWE Network five years ago. First-time customers can still sign up for a free month, including April, when its hugely popular WrestleMania event takes place. The company reported 2 million total subscribers right after that show this year. By September paid subscribers had fallen to about 1.5 million, an indication of how many had jumped on board for that offer.“We learned hope is not a good strategy”George Barrios, WWE’s co-president, says it’s sticking with free trials because they’re a relatively cheap way to get new customers. The company is making changes to its service, though, including adding free content on its app to immerse customers in the WWE world. “We think it’s a huge opportunity,” he says. “Fans who may not be ready to subscribe, it gives them a home where they can experience a ton of short-form content, though not the premium content.”John Skipper, the former head of ESPN and now executive chairman of DAZN Group, a sports streaming service, told guests at the Code Media conference in November that he’s rethought the service’s free-month promotion. DAZN had offered a trial in December 2018 that included its marquee attraction, a boxing match featuring Canelo Alvarez. People signed up but didn’t renew at the rates Skipper wanted. So he eliminated the trial, doubled the service’s monthly price to $20, and introduced a season of boxing matches, with the biggest ones scheduled a little more than 30 days after the last one to encourage fans to stick around. “We learned hope is not a good strategy,” Skipper says.Recurly is also making sure that its streaming clients don’t cancel a customer if a payment is declined on the first try. Valid credit cards can be rejected by mistake. The company suggests billing debit card holders on the 15th or 30th, paydays when their accounts are less likely to be overdrawn.Kevin Mayer, chairman of Disney’s direct-to-consumer business, says he’s already learned a lot from the company’s March acquisition of a majority stake in Hulu, including about the need to monitor customers’ viewing habits to see if they’ve stopped watching. The company can try to keep audiences engaged by highlighting upcoming programs that may interest them. Disney has gone so far as to suggest customers subscribe to Hulu’s $55-a-month live TV package during football season and then switch to a cheaper one without sports in the offseason.Ultimately, the shift to a direct-to-consumer model will be won by the companies with the best content. In the past, a run of bombs could lead TV networks to bad ratings and a loss of advertisers, but revenue from cable subscriber fees would offset the pain, brokerage firm Cowen & Co. noted in a recent report. Now duds are likely to lead more quickly to cancellations, which explains why the 10 largest players are expected to spend a combined $116 billion next year on programming.Richard Broughton, research director at Ampere Analysis, a media consulting firm, says the most popular services release as many as one new series a week. People would rather watch a mediocre new program than a critically acclaimed old one, he says. Disney’s boost from The Mandalorian won’t last forever. When the company’s deal with Verizon ends, Broughton says, “there will be a wave of cancellations unless Disney drops a number of new series.”\\n \\nRead more: Bob Iger Takes the Gloves Off for Disney’s Streaming Debut'),\n",

       "  '2019-10-23',\n",
       "  'Can the Murdoch-backed livestreaming service take down its Amazon-owned rival?Rapper The Game on his Caffeine show.On Thursday nights at around 7 p.m. in California, Jayceon Taylor, an American rapper known as the Game, likes to play video games with his friends. NBA 2K20 is one of his staples. Opponents have learned to beware of his virtual midrange jump shot.Appreciation of such skills might once have been limited to the members of a celebrity’s entourage. But in 2019, the circle of potential admirers and hecklers has widened considerably. These days, anyone who wants to watch the Game and his buddies dunk on each other can hop on Caffeine, a free livestreaming service, and cheer on the action in an accompanying chat room. “Game, don’t forget to set up that rematch between me and you in Madden,” said Snoop Dogg in a recent promo. “You’ve been running from me.”Many of the current shows on Caffeine feature voluble hosts offering stream-of-consciousness commentary as they compete in one video game or another—Fortnite, World of Warcraft, Overwatch. In other words, it’s essentially the same genre popularized by Twitch, the livestreaming service that Amazon.com Inc. acquired in 2014 for $970 million and which has since grown into a giant vortex of teenage status and attention.The Game is the rare host on Caffeine who is well known outside video gaming circles. But that’s about to change. Throughout this fall, Caffeine will be rolling out a new slate of programming, starring established entertainers, designed to position Caffeine as a more mainstream alternative to Twitch. “Caffeine is not just about hardcore gamers,” says Ben Keighran, founder and chief executive officer. “We’re broader than that.”Or, at least, it aspires to be—thanks in no small part to Lachlan Murdoch.Murdoch, executive chairman and chief executive of the new Fox Corp., sits on Caffeine’s board of directors. Like Tucker Roberts, the scion of the Comcast media empire, Lachlan, eldest son of Rupert, is a big believer in the future of esports. In 2018, prior to selling much of its assets to Disney, 21st Century Fox invested $100 million in Caffeine and formed a joint venture called Caffeine Studios, which is now part of new Fox. In recent months, Caffeine Studios has set up shop on Fox’s lot in the Century City section of Los Angeles, and created a studio in Burbank. It also started recruiting celebrities and social media influencers to create exclusive livestreaming content.For now, the company is keeping its roster of hired-gun influencers under wraps. “You can come in and see which person you want to hang out with,” says Keighran. “That person could be streaming a video game, or they could be snowboarding, or streaming from Coachella, or from one of our studios with a very carefully crafted show.”Keighran, 37, grew up in Sydney. In 2012 he sold his app search company Chomp to Apple for $50 million. Afterward, he joined Apple and oversaw software design for Apple TV. In 2016 he co-founded Caffeine with Sam Roberts, a former colleague from Apple who has since left the startup. Keighran calls the format “social broadcasting.” “You can talk to the commentator, you can become the commentator, and you can interact with other viewers,” he says.Much of the current demand for “social broadcasting” is centered on major esports events. Keighran thinks the phenomenon will eventually spread to the traditional sports universe via young viewers who have grown up wanting to be the next Ninja, rather than the next Joe Buck. Thanks to its partnership with Fox—which, among other things, airs professional football, baseball, golf, stock car racing, wrestling, soccer, boxing, lacrosse, rugby, and bowling—Caffeine is well positioned to pioneer the trend, says Keighran.But securing livestreaming rights for desirable sporting events can be costly. Consider the NFL. On Sept. 26, Caffeine’s partners at Fox aired the Thursday matchup between the Green Bay Packers and the Philadelphia Eagles. Despite the affiliation with Fox, fans couldn’t watch a livestream of the game on Caffeine. Instead, they had to turn to Amazon, which is paying the NFL $65 million a year to livestream Thursday night games. The online broadcast appeared not just on Amazon Prime Video but also on Caffeine’s social broadcasting rival Twitch. There, viewers could choose among a handful of channels, each featuring a different Twitch personality—including TimTheTatman, AngryJoe, and Gutfoxx—narrating the Packers-Eagles game in a signature style.The current streams of live sports on Caffeine are limited to decidedly less-popular pastimes. In May, the service’s viewers were treated to a live college softball game pitting St. John’s vs. Butler. (The Big East Conference is an early adopter on Caffeine). Eric Shanks, the chief executive officer of Fox Sports, says that Fox and Caffeine are still figuring out ways to capitalize on the crossover potential.For now, esports is the main focus. In August, when FIFA hosted its annual eWorld Cup competition, the virtual soccer matches aired on both Caffeine and FS1, Fox’s sports cable channel. “The interactivity plays much more of a key role in esports than in traditional sports,” says Shanks. “It’s still early days.”Caffeine will be trying to make up ground in an increasingly competitive field. According to data from StreamElements, in the third quarter of 2019 (a period covering July to September), Twitch was the clear market leader in livestreaming, accounting for 75.6% of the total hours watched, followed by YouTube Gaming (with 17.6%), Facebook Gaming (3.7%), and Microsoft’s Mixer (3.2%). In August, Mixer successfully lured away Tyler “Ninja” Blevins, one of the world’s top livestreaming personalities, from Twitch, signing him to an exclusive contract for an undisclosed amount. The competition for talent is expected to grow fiercer, likely driving up costs for all the livestreaming platforms.At the moment, Caffeine is a minnow, by comparison. According to mobile app researcher Apptopia, since June 2017, Caffeine’s iOS app has been downloaded 865,207 times. During the same time period, Twitch’s iOS app has 52 million downloads.Joost van Dreunen, a gaming industry analyst with Nielsen’s SuperData, says that while Caffeine’s technology and design are impressive, it will be difficult to catch up with the competition. “Strategically, you’re asking people to do several new things: a new platform, a new brand, a new content type, and also a new way of monetizing it,” says van Dreunen. “Consumers are going to get a headache early on. If this was three years ago, I’d be like, ‘Awesome.’ But that’s not the case. I think Fox is late to the game here.”There is no advertising on Caffeine, which aims to make money via in-app purchases. The platform has its own internal currency, called Caffeine Gold, that viewers can use to buy virtual animated items, which can be deployed in chat rooms to express support for one’s livestreaming host. It’s a behavior that Keighran compares to traditional sports fans “buying a jersey or a foam finger to stand out in a crowd at a live event.”Anyone who does a livestream on Caffeine can earn money by soliciting virtual donations from viewers. The gifts, which can be purchased with Gold during a broadcast, range from such things as an animated siren (which costs 5 coins; the equivalent of 50 cents), to a rose (10 coins; approximately $1), to a unicorn (150 coins), to a potato (999 coins). The more digital items broadcasters attract from viewers during a livestream, the more “Caffeine Credits” they earn; if applicable, the copyright holder of, say, the video game being played may also get a cut. The credits, in turn, can be converted back into “Caffeine Gold” or cashed out. It’s basically a tradeable currency that broadcasters amass from their fans.Caffeine takes a cut of each transaction, a slice of each digital pie. The tips are voluntary, and not everyone contributes. But those who do, says Keighran, allow everyone else to enjoy an ad-free, subscription-free experience. “Fortnite makes several billion dollars a year in in-app purchases,” says Keighran. “This appears to be how the next generation wants to pay for content.”'),\n",

       "  '2019-10-23',\n",
       "  'PHOTO ILLUSTRATION: SCOTT GELBER FOR BLOOMBERG BUSINESSWEEK; PHOTOGRAPHER: LIPO CHING/SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE/POLARISAnnual iPhone sales should provide 200 million free trial subscriptions, which could net billions a year in new revenue. The question is whether Apple TV+ can keep users coming back.In late March, a large delegation of celebrities and their handlers arrived in Cupertino, Calif., like explorers on an exotic island. The group, which included Oprah Winfrey, J.J. Abrams, and Jason Momoa, went to Apple Inc.’s headquarters for the launch of Apple TV+, the tech company’s new subscription video service.After a series of announcements about subscription news and video game services, plus one about a credit card, Apple’s Zack Van Amburg and Jamie Erlicht appeared on stage and promised a lineup of a dozen original shows featuring “the best stories ever told,” as Erlicht put it.After the presentation, agents and managers began peppering Van Amburg and Erlicht, who run the company’s TV efforts, with complaints. Only a handful of the celebrities who’d flown to the Bay Area for the event had been asked to appear; other big names who’d come, including Jennifer Garner and Chris Evans, hadn’t even been mentioned. The general feeling among the Hollywood types, according to several executives who attended, was one of resentment and confusion.Van Amburg and Erlicht hadn’t said how much the service would cost. Nor had they shown much footage from any of the new shows. They hadn’t mentioned whether Apple TV+ would include reruns of other popular shows, in addition to original series. Why, the Hollywood delegation wondered, would anybody pay for a service that had so few programs?Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has staked Apple’s future growth on subscription services, including Apple TV+, which will debut on Nov. 1 with programming such as Morning Show, a drama set in the world of TV news that stars Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston, and See, a science-fiction series starring Momoa. Cook’s goal is to strengthen customers’ loyalty to the company’s hardware while generating additional revenue through a monthly subscription. But Apple is entering an exceedingly crowded market, and will be competing with new streaming services from Disney, Comcast, and AT&T, among others. This story is based on interviews with more than a dozen executives who worked at Apple or on its programs. The company declined to comment.Although Apple has deep ties to Hollywood—Steve Jobs co-founded the animation studio Pixar in 1986—it had long resisted entering the messy business of producing movies and TV shows. The company’s strategy began to shift with the rise of Netflix and Spotify, which rendered iTunes’ marketplace for downloadable music and movies more or less obsolete. In 2014, in an effort to shore up iTunes, Apple spent $3 billion to purchase Beats, an audio products and music streaming venture co-founded by rapper Dr. Dre and music producer Jimmy Iovine. The following year, the company started a new streaming service, Apple Music.Under Eddy Cue, Apple’s services chief, the company funded a handful of TV projects—including Carpool Karaoke, a spinoff from comedian James Corden’s late-night TV segments on CBS, and a reality show called Planet of the Apps, in which tech entrepreneurs pitched startup ideas while riding up escalators. The company distributed them on Apple Music, but did little to promote the shows. They were panned by critics. Variety called Planet of the Apps a “bland, tepid, barely competent knock-off of ‘Shark Tank.’”Apple also discussed releasing scripted programming, including a project involving Keanu Reeves, according to people familiar with the matter. But it didn’t want to finance them, and those plans sputtered out. The company did produce Vital Signs, a gangster-rap bildungsroman developed by Iovine and based on Dr. Dre’s rise to the top of the music industry—but then declined to release it.One challenge, the former executives say, was taste. Because he wanted to protect the Apple brand, Cook insisted on reviewing episodes to snuff out anything potentially controversial. At one point, Apple delayed Carpool Karaoke to recut several episodes, including one in which Gwyneth Paltrow dropped a reference to vaginal steaming.Despite the failings, Apple never gave up on Hollywood. Cue pursued Imagine Entertainment, the production company led by Brian Grazer and Ron Howard. The two producers, whose work includes A Beautiful Mind, Friday Night Lights, and Empire, flew to Cupertino to present Cue with a term sheet. Cook, a Happy Days fan, made a surprise appearance to see Howard, who played Richie Cunningham on the 1970s sitcom. But Grazer and Howard eventually bailed after deciding they didn’t want to be employees of a large company, according to people familiar with the negotiation.After the deal fell apart, Apple hired Van Amburg and Erlicht in June 2017 from Sony, where they’d produced Breaking Bad. “Jamie and Zack are two of the most talented TV executives in the world and have been instrumental in making this the golden age of television,” Cue said in a statement at the time. “We have exciting plans in store.”A few weeks later, Van Amburg and Erlicht met with Aniston and Witherspoon, who were pitching a new idea for a drama. Although they were meeting with a half-dozen networks, including HBO, Showtime, and Netflix, Apple had something unique to offer: an almost unlimited bankroll.Van Amburg and Erlicht promised to make two seasons of Aniston and Witherspoon’s show without shooting a pilot episode first, and they offered more than $250 million, including more than $1 million per episode for each actress, according to people familiar with the terms. This was unprecedented. At the time, the biggest TV stars earned about $500,000 each per episode. “Reese and I are so proud to be part of this exciting launch with Apple,” Aniston said at the March event. In the months that followed, Apple also bought projects from NBA star Kevin Durant, Glass director M. Night Shyamalan, and comedian Kumail Nanjiani.Building a studio from scratch is a major undertaking. Twice, Van Amburg and Erlicht have replaced the person in charge of Morning Show—a telltale sign of a troubled production. Studio executives complain that when budgets on shows have exceeded initial projections, they’ve been asked to share the costs, which is an unusual practice in Hollywood. The executives have also chafed at Apple’s penchant for secrecy. Van Amburg and Erlicht gave projects code names, a hallmark of Silicon Valley product development that’s unusual in the film industry, and insisted that partners sign nondisclosure agreements before they could see materials from their own shows.At Apple’s first Hollywood premiere, in October, Van Amburg and Erlicht addressed the sense of whiplash head-on. “Zack and I knew how to create a premium, high-quality, great show,” Erlicht said. “What, in retrospect, we didn’t know how to do was create from scratch a premium service at Apple.”When it debuts in November, Apple TV+ will offer the new shows and a handful of original movies for $4.99 a month, but it will be free for a year to anyone who buys a new iPhone or an Apple TV set-top box. The service will also include a marketplace where viewers can pay to subscribe to streaming services from the likes of HBO, Showtime, and Starz, with Apple taking a cut of each transaction.For now, Van Amburg and Erlicht have told producers they want a handful of shows with big stars that can be marketed in Apple stores worldwide. Although none of the original shows will feature HBO-levels of violence and sex, it’s not all G-rated, either. Van Amburg and Erlicht have ordered a show that includes a heroin addict, for instance.The effort is modest, especially by the standards of the world’s most valuable company. But Apple sells about 200 million iPhones annually, which means 200 million potential trial users in the first year. If even a quarter of those people keep Apple TV+ after their yearlong freebie, Apple will have one of the most-watched TV networks in the world and an additional $3 billion in annual revenue. That was what happened with Apple Music, which offered a three-month free trial to more than 1 billion people. In the four years since Apple Music debuted, the service has attracted more than 60 million customers, making it the clear No. 2 player after Spotify, which has more than 100 million paid subscribers.Apple has “a massive install base and an incredible marketing machine,” says Rich Greenfield, an analyst with LightShed Partners. “How well they execute … who knows?” —With Anousha Sakoui '),\n",

       "  '2019-09-24',\n",
       "  'Virgin Trains USA is planning to sell bonds for a line that starts 90 miles from downtown L.A.Virgin Trains USA President Patrick Goddard and Richard Branson.Virgin Trains USA has a big idea: Make train travel a hip, convenient alternative to driving in some of the most autocentric parts of the country. Backed by Fortress Investment Group private equity funds, the company last year launched the country’s first new privately financed intercity passenger rail in a century along Florida’s east coast. Its Miami hub is a gleaming, citrus-perfumed station where blue-blazered employees stock the VIP lounge with complimentary charcuterie.Now the company has Las Vegas in its sights. It says it can bring revelers there from the Los Angeles area by electric trains that can reach 150 mph. Wowed by the prospect of jobs and traffic relief, a California state agency in September approved the first step in Virgin Trains’ plans to sell as much as $4.2 billion in tax-exempt debt for the $4.8 billion project. The company says construction of the 170-mile line, mainly along the median of Interstate 15, will take three years, and it’ll start in 2023. That would make speedy rail a reality in California, where a voter-approved bullet train between San Francisco and Los Angeles has been beset with delays and cost overruns over the past decade.The hitch: The California terminus isn’t in L.A. itself, but in the outlying community of Apple Valley, 90 miles northeast of downtown. Virgin Trains will have to persuade Angelenos to give up their cars and pay about $60 each way for a 90-minute train trip—after they’ve already driven as far as the Mojave Desert.A proposed new line shortens the drive but doesn’t reach L.A.Data: Virgin Trains USAIn pitches to California and Nevada officials, the company talks about eventually connecting to Los Angeles, but it doesn’t offer a timetable for that. And when executives tout their Florida achievement, they don’t mention that they’re behind ridership projections for that stretch. It was only in June that the company broke ground for an extension of the line—of about 170 miles—running northwest to tourist-rich Orlando, which it expects to open in 2022.There’s also no word on when additional stations may open in Tampa and at Walt Disney World. Tapping Disney tourists was an ultimate goal pitched to buyers of the high-yield municipal debt the company sold in April and June for the Orlando expansion. The sales occurred several months after the company put its initial public offering on hold. Since then, yields on the unrated bonds suggest the market is skeptical that the Florida train will work out as well as hoped.“If I get involved in a project like that, having seen what went on in Florida, I would have to be somewhat suspect of the perfect ending and perfect outcome,” says Jim Colby, senior municipal strategist at Van Eck Associates Corp., which holds some of the Florida securities. Virgin Trains executives say their model of serving areas that are “too long to drive, too short to fly” works and can be replicated throughout the country. “Faster and cheaper in transportation always win,” says spokesman Ben Porritt. The company was known as Brightline before a marketing deal last year with Richard Branson’s Virgin Group, which also bought a small piece of it. Softbank Group Corp. owns Fortress.The Vegas rail idea isn’t new. A company called DesertXpress Enterprises LLC had been trying since 2005 to get the project running. Virgin Trains bought it in March; over the past few months, it has hosted four delegations of California officials in Florida to see its system firsthand.The prospective station in California is in a part of San Bernardino County called Victor Valley, a community of four cities including Apple Valley at the edge of the Mojave that was hit hard by the housing bust. Porritt calls it a “strategic location” for drivers from Los Angeles deciding whether to press on to Vegas. It would be “without a doubt the largest project the High Desert has seen and may ever see,” says Art Bishop, a councilman in Apple Valley. Once they make their way to the city station, passengers could drop off their bags. They’d see them again in their hotel rooms after a trip including food and beverage services and free Wi-Fi. “You would be able to essentially start your evening in Las Vegas from the second you jump onto our train,” Porritt says.An economic analysis commissioned by Virgin Trains predicts the project will employ thousands of construction workers and more than 500 people after completion, as well as remove carbon from the air by taking 4.5 million cars off the freeway. “If they can get from Los Angeles to Vegas, no one is going to be driving or flying anymore,” says California Treasurer Fiona Ma, who toured the Florida rail line. But the train ticket has to compete with direct ways to get to Vegas. Over a mid-October weekend, people can fly there from Los Angeles International Airport for about $200 or rent a midsize car for about $70 a day, according to an online search.Even John Miller, co-head of fixed income at Nuveen LLC, which holds a lot of the bonds sold in April for the Florida rail, isn’t yet sold on the California project. The location outside of Los Angeles is a “concern,” and he wants to see cost details. The project’s estimated price tag is 40% lower than projected in 2015, which Virgin Trains chalks up to design differences.The Florida line began running in January 2018. Passengers from Miami sitting in the most expensive cars (around $40) can order complimentary bloody marys until the train pulls into the West Palm Beach station an hour and 15 minutes later. The taxpayer-funded station at Orlando International Airport is slated for 2022, and new stations in Aventura, Boca Raton, and the Port of Miami will open in 2020.That would boost ridership. Over the first eight months of this year, 639,373 passengers rode the railroad, making it unlikely the year would end with more than 2 million of them, which was the expectation in a study distributed to investors. The company counters such concerns with more numbers: It needs just 2% of the 390 million total trips taken annually between southeast Florida and Orlando to succeed.It’s “incredibly optimistic” for the company to seek additional financing with its key Orlando expansion under way, says Nicholos Venditti, a portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management. But it’s also smart, he says, given today’s low interest rates and a bullish environment for bonds. “They’re in a world where investors broadly are yield-starved,” Venditti says. “They will be able to get it done at kind of unprecedented levels for a project of this size and with this kind of risk.” —With Jonathan Levin'),\n",

       "  'The Ride of a Lifetime should have been called How to Succeed in a Business Full of Prima Donnas and Raging Egomaniacs.Iger speaks at the Disney Legends Awards ceremony fan event in Anaheim, Calif., on Aug. 23.Photographer: Li Ying/ReduxThe title of Bob Iger’s new book, The Ride of a Lifetime: Lessons Learned From 15 Years as CEO of the Walt Disney Company (Random House, $28), suggests that it will appeal primarily to corporate ladder climbers. But once Iger dispenses with some inspirational evangelizing, he treats readers to a vivid account of his 45-year career, one that might more aptly be titled How to Succeed in a Business Full of Prima Donnas and Raging Egomaniacs.The broad outline of Iger’s saga is well-known—how he toiled for almost a decade in the shadow of his combative predecessor Michael Eisner and took command of the besieged Magic Kingdom in 2005, rejuvenating it with bold acquisitions such as Pixar, Marvel Entertainment, Lucasfilm, and, later, much of 21st Century Fox. As it turns out, there’s a lot we didn’t know about Iger’s maneuvers and, indeed, the man himself.Determined to do better than his father, a failed advertising executive who gave up a chance to be a big-band trumpeter, he joined ABC in 1974 and became a protégé of Roone Arledge, the mercurial force behind Monday Night Football and Wide World of Sports. Iger admired Arledge’s willingness to rip up shows at the last minute and keep everybody in the editing room until dawn in pursuit of perfection. Less endearing was his proclivity for pitting his underlings against one another, a trait Iger attributes to insecurity.When the Walt Disney Co. bought ABC’s parent company in 1996, Iger wanted to position himself as Eisner’s No.\\u20092 and possible successor. Instead, Eisner recruited superagent Michael Ovitz, who, Iger writes, spent his time acting like a big shot, interrupting meetings to take calls from Tom Cruise and President Bill Clinton. Ovitz left after little more than a year with a scandalous $140 million severance package.Eisner announced his resignation plans in 2004, leaving Iger to vie with EBay Inc. Chief Executive Officer Meg Whitman for the top job. He describes this as an often humiliating experience. One of the lowest points came when he had to go to New York to be interviewed by headhunter Gerry Roche, who had lunch brought in during the meeting for himself—but not Iger—then cut things short to catch a plane to a wedding.Ultimately, Iger prevailed. As CEO, he resuscitated Disney’s ailing animation division with the company’s $7.4 billion purchase of Pixar. In the process he became unlikely buddies with Pixar’s CEO: Steve Jobs. The notoriously brusque Jobs occasionally rankled the diplomatic Disney CEO, calling one of Disney’s budget hotels in Orlando “crap” and telling him that Iron Man 2 “sucked.”Jobs wasn’t the only difficult personality with whom Iger had to negotiate. He persuaded Ike Perlmutter, the secretive former Israeli military officer who controlled Marvel Entertainment, to sell his company to Disney in 2009 for $4 billion. Iger let him stick around and run everything at Marvel but the movie division. Even so, Perlmutter’s people tried to thwart Disney’s efforts to make Black Panther, saying that a black superhero wouldn’t crush at the box office. “I called Ike and told him to tell his team to stop putting up roadblocks,” Iger writes. Black Panther went on to make more than $1 billion.Then there’s George Lucas, who had seller’s remorse after Iger persuaded him to part with his company in 2012 for $4 billion. Iger writes that Lucas became irate when Disney didn’t religiously adhere to his plans for its first Star Wars sequel, The Force Awakens. Iger tried to smooth things over, inviting Lucas to the premiere and praising him lavishly. Yet in an interview with Charlie Rose, Lucas said that selling his company to Disney felt like turning over his children to “white slavers.” He later apologized, but the experience clearly wounded Iger.Every major player in Hollywood makes an appearance in The Ride of a Lifetime. Rupert Murdoch approached Iger in 2017 about selling 21st Century Fox to Disney. Iger writes that Murdoch’s idea of an icebreaker at their first chat was to ask, “Are you running for president?” Iger confirms that he had been speaking with prominent Democrats about it, but he wasn’t going to tell Murdoch and have him splash it all over Fox News. The acquisition became its own drama as Comcast Corp. also made a play for the company, and in the ensuing bidding war, Disney ended up paying $71 billion.It’s hard to blame Iger if he sounds a little weary in the final section of the book. He’s 68. He’d planned to step down in June, but as part of his deal with Murdoch, he’s agreed to stick around until 2021. In November, Iger’s company is scheduled to launch Disney+, the closely observed streaming service, and its success or failure will color his legacy. If anybody needs inspiration now, it’s Bob Iger. His ride isn’t over yet.'),\n",

       "  '2019-09-18',\n",
       "  'The Who’s Pete Townshend smashes his guitar while performing at the Forum in Los Angeles on Nov. 23, 1973.Most Monday mornings, a cheery cabal of Hollywood-area music makers meets at a private club on the beach in Malibu. They call themselves the Composers Breakfast Club, and in recent months, over smoked salmon and fresh fruit, they’ve grappled with one of the biggest threats facing their vocation: a tsunami of copyright infringement lawsuits that has many of them worried they’ll be the next ones forced to pay out millions of dollars for stealing a catchy riff.In the composers’ eyes, infringement claims have gone too far. At one breakfast in July, they reenacted the 2015 copyright trial in which a jury found Pharrell Williams and Robin Thicke had ripped off Marvin Gaye’s Got to Give It Up for their hit Blurred Lines, resulting in a $5.3 million judgment. The tongue-in-cheek proceedings (overseen by a “judge” whose day job is overseeing music legal issues at Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures Production) resulted in the exact opposite verdict when the jury of about 50 composers in attendance overwhelmingly found that the newer song didn’t exactly copy Gaye’s. In August a breakfast club member lamented the $2.8 million judgment against Katy Perry and her collaborators for copying a Christian rap song in her 2013 hit Dark Horse. The assembled composers shook their head in agreement that the jury of musical laypeople just hadn’t understood the difference between sounding similar and actually copying unique combinations of notes.Yet there’s hope in Malibu, both for the breakfasting composers and for today’s top pop stars. Another battle, over whether Led Zeppelin’s Stairway to Heaven was a ripoff, may soon tilt the tables in favor of creators of new music by limiting protection for their predecessors. At issue is whether an antiquated copyright system based on sheet music for most of the 20th century can be weaponized against artists of the era because their record companies consistently failed to put every single note of their recordings onto paper. A Bloomberg Businessweek investigation this year found that potentially unprotected riffs include famous guitar, sax, and keyboard solos from rock and soul treasures. Lynyrd Skynyrd’s Free Bird, with an album version running more than nine minutes, has an initial deposit copy—the draft of sheet music that stands as a copyright application before 1978—of only eight lines and no registration that includes its guitar solos.Such a shift in thinking about intellectual property has the eager backing of the music industry and the Trump administration, which has formally taken Led Zeppelin’s side. From a business perspective, what the big record companies and music publishers are seeking in the Stairway case is to blow up copyright protection for the oldies, including the most iconic rock and soul songs, in favor of music by newer, more lucrative acts.On Sept. 23 a rare 11-judge panel of the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco will hear arguments in the Stairway case, which Led Zeppelin originally won in a 2016 trial. The core question is this: Will the court back the music industry’s argument that songs registered before 1978 should be afforded only “thin” protection limited to the bare notes on often cursory sheet music that songwriters’ record companies deposited—hence “deposit copies”—at the U.S. Copyright Office? Until 1978 federal copyright law required composition deposits on paper and didn’t allow recordings. The song that Led Zeppelin is accused of lifting, an obscure instrumental, Taurus by the band Spirit, was registered in 1967 as barely one page with 124 notes.The legal liberalization that the music companies are advocating would give current creators freer rein to cannibalize familiar sounds with impunity. Yes, composers need copyright protection, “but they also need copyright law to let them create new music incorporating ideas from the vast cultural library of past musical works,” the Recording Industry Association of America and the National Music Publishers’ Association wrote in a joint amicus brief to the appeals judges. “Authors, including composers, must and should use unprotectable elements created by those creators coming before them.”To the owners of the old copyrights, the industry position reads like an attempted heist. “They want to legalize copyright infringement,” says David Pullman, an investor in music rights who’s a plaintiff in one of the biggest pending cases. He and other rights holders to Gaye’s Let’s Get It On are demanding more than $100 million for the alleged theft of the song for Ed Sheeran’s hit Thinking Out Loud. That New York litigation, in which Sheeran denies any copying, is suspended pending the outcome of the Stairway appeal.Pullman, who’s best known for turning David Bowie’s music royalty flows into “Bowie bonds” in 1997, takes a long and gimlet-eyed view of the business. “The publishing and record companies would love to be able to have stars infringe, because they can make more money this way,” he says.The Trump administration’s decision to join the fray underscores the stakes. A U.S. Department of Justice lawyer will even make arguments at the hearing, using time allocated to Led Zeppelin’s legal team. The government’s brief argues that even the least complete deposit copies should at a minimum include basics such as melody and that “failure to incorporate elements such as these in the deposit copy would reflect a failing on the part of the copyright owner or its agent.”The government stance doesn’t fully reflect the messy historic truth about how music and copyright deposits were made during a golden age of popular music. Songs were often composed by recording artists with no knowledge of musical notation and then transcribed by record company clerks for the registrations. Those deposit copies capture only a fraction of what’s on the studio recordings.As a result of the sketchy sheet music, there are unregistered bits of song that could be up for grabs if the courts restrict pre-1978 compositions’ protection to their deposit copies. The deposit copy of Gaye’s Let’s Get It On only has chords, lyrics, and melody, making it conceivable that someone could record a karaoke track identical to the record and never infringe the song’s copyright—because all the other backing notes and sounds such as the bass line, wah-wah guitar, backup singing, strings, and horns aren’t present in the sheet music.Even more lucrative possibilities? Commercial exploitation for ringtones, ads, video games, or entire new songs would be a logical next step. For now, who could own what is in flux. The government addressed the possibility of orphaned riffs in its Stairway brief, saying the law change in 1978 grandfathered in any protectable, original elements of older songs that hadn’t been in deposit copies. Their owners need only register them to gain protection. In practice, it’s unclear whether any of those famous (and overplayed) riffs, such as the Eagles’ Hotel California guitar solos or the Doors’ keyboards from Riders on the Storm, would still count as original if registered today and used in court to challenge an infringement.“The Beatles got inspired by so many black artists, then came hip-hop, then everybody got sued. It’s just fascinating that we all stand on the shoulders of giants”But isn’t it far-fetched that someone would try to cash in on, say, an unregistered but totally familiar Santana solo?Nope.In Malibu at the Composers Breakfast Club, such opportunities are the stuff of dreams and dollar signs. It’s easy to find music makers drooling at the possibility that some of the most familiar tunes of the 20th century will be unprotected. Malte Hagemeister, 46, wearing a Beatles T-shirt and a leather man bag across his chest that resembles a gun holster, is among the most eager to learn more about what he could legally lift. In his native Germany, Hagemeister got his start recording and selling vinyl gray-market mashups that lacked legal clearances from the underlying composers. Now in Venice Beach, Calif., he “feeds his family”—wife and five children—by creating music that he licenses for TV and ads. A greenlight from the Stairway case to use old riffs would make it easier for him to create lucrative tunes and jingles. “The ad world loves recognizable pieces,” Hagemeister says. “You make a piece with an energetic beat and an element that everybody knows, quote it, and you can then license it to advertising.”This doesn’t mean Hagemeister and his breakfast club colleagues want to cheat or steal. The creative process—and its history—is more complicated than that. “The Beatles got inspired by so many black artists, then came hip-hop, then everybody got sued. It’s just fascinating that we all stand on the shoulders of giants,” he says.What’s needed, Hagemeister says, is a copyright overhaul that recognizes the need for creating new works with the old building blocks—just as the record companies are advocating—but in a way that fully compensates the giants on whose shoulders he’s perched. Among the barriers is the law that allows for recording a cover version of a song and compensating the songwriter but doesn’t provide a similar license for using small bits of lots of songs. “There should be a way to divide the bounty without suing,” he says. “From an artist’s perspective, it’s beautiful that we have something to protect our rights of creativity. It is precious, but it’s gotten too complicated.”For a taste of the complication, just read through the docket of the Stairway case. First there was the trial. Then last year, a three-judge panel on San Francisco’s federal appeals court ordered a do-over of that trial for procedural reasons (which hasn’t happened). The panel also declared that for older songs, the deposited sheet music “defines the scope of the copyright.” That ruling set off a second round of appeals by both sides that led the court to convene this second, bigger panel that’s poised to hear the case again.Court watchers (the hearing will be streamed live online) will want to home in on the idea of “thin” copyright protection, which is entwined with the deposit copy issue. It’s the second half of Led Zeppelin’s one-two punch. First there are very few protected notes in the Taurus deposit copy. Then at best those notes are simply an arrangement of commonplace elements, such as an A-minor chord and a descending scale, the government brief argues. “Such a combination is subject at most to a thin copyright,” the government brief says.Observers will also want to keep an eye on the bar-brawling Philadelphia lawyer who brought the Stairway suit, Francis Malofiy. His response to the Trump administration’s brief begins, “The Trump Administration’s foray into this copyright case is an embarrassment that fails to understand the applicable law for the history of copyright,” then cites President Trump’s bashing the San Francisco appeals court as reasons the judges shouldn’t try to legislate from the bench.Regardless of any fireworks, whatever the appeals judges decide will have immediate ramifications for the copyright disputes already in courts and the countless claims being hashed out in private.The implications for intellectual-property rights may even go far beyond music, especially if the judges embrace the idea of “thin” copyright. Until now, case law shows a similar concept has been applied to creative works such as sculpture and computer interfaces, where judges saw limited combinations of elements possible in, say, a statue of a woman or the layout of a laptop screen. Under “thin” copyright protection, such designs could be protected only from “exact” copying. Apply the same thin protection to screenplays or video games, and knockoffs are suddenly a lot easier.In the music business, the next biggest decision to come will be the Let’s Get It On litigation in New York federal court. Whereas the Stairway case is about ancient rock, this one involves Sheeran, one of the biggest stars of this century, and the way music is made today. Between that $100 million case and a possible trip for Led Zeppelin to the U.S. Supreme Court, we may learn soon how music will be made in the future—and whether record companies and their big stars will rake in billions while the aged rockers and their heirs will be left with a pittance.'),\n",

       "  '2019-09-08',\n",
       "  \"The future of football starts with Sunday Ticket.Earlier this summer, John Skipper, the former president of ESPN who’s now the executive chairman of DAZN Group, a subscription streaming service for sports, approached the NFL to see if he might be able to acquire the streaming rights for DirecTV’s Sunday Ticket. DirecTV, which AT&T Inc. bought in 2014, pays the NFL $1.5 billion a year for Sunday Ticket, giving it the exclusive rights to air numerous NFL games each week until 2021. But the agreement had a July opt-out date.Skipper’s hope was that the NFL would take the early opt-out and split the rights between an online company and a broadcast or satellite company. And of course, he wanted that online company to be his startup, pronounced “Da Zone,” which so far has focused on boxing and mixed martial arts. The company has no intention of remaining a niche player. As Ira Boudway wrote in Bloomberg Businessweek earlier this year, “Skipper won’t call DAZN a ‘Netflix for sports,’ at least not publicly, but it’s useful shorthand” for the company’s ambitions. And if there’s one sure-fire way to make that goal a reality in the U.S., it’s by landing the rights to some National Football League games. “Many media businesses have been built on the strength of the NFL’s content, and OTT will be no different,” Skipper wrote me in an email. (OTT, or over-the-top, is industry lingo for streaming TV untethered to a cable subscription.)As it turns out, the July deadline came and went, with the NFL choosing to stick with DirecTV. On one level, that’s perfectly understandable. Who turns their back on $1.5 billion a year? But it also means the NFL remains years behind the other professional major leagues in offering the millions of people who have abandoned cable TV the means to watch its games. By continuing its DirecTV deal, the NFL effectively opted to punt on fourth-and-one. We probably won’t see that conservative play-calling again.When DirecTV was founded in June 1994—it was originally a division of the satellite maker, Hughes Communications Inc.—the big networks were recovering from a major shock. Seven months earlier, the NFL had taken away the rights to its Sunday National Football Conference games from CBS, which had been airing pro football since 1956, and awarded them to fledgling Fox Broadcasting. Rupert Murdoch, who had started the Fox network eight years earlier, understood the power of sports to legitimize a network and offered the NFL $1.58 billion for a four-year deal, which was $400 million more than CBS had.Until the Fox incursion, all three of the major networks aired NFL games: NBC had the Sunday American Football Conference games (most of the teams came from the old AFL, which NBC had televised), and ABC had Monday Night Football. The NFL also created a package of Sunday night games in 1987, which ESPN aired. The Sunday and Monday night games were aired nationally, but the Sunday afternoon ones were regional, televised only in areas the NFL considered home territory for the various teams. Fans who had grown up in, say, Pittsburgh but now lived in Los Angeles had no way to watch the Steelers when they played on Sunday afternoons.Unless, that is, they went to a sports bar. A few years earlier, a restaurant consultant named Jon Taffer (who now hosts a show called Bar Rescue) had worked with a satellite company to come up with a plan to offer “out of market” games to sports bars. When the NFL learned about it, the league brought Taffer in-house and soon rolled out Sunday Ticket—at first only for bars and restaurants; eventually, DirecTV acquired the Sunday Ticket rights in 1994 for a mere $25 million per year.Since then, every time the contract has come up for renewal, the cost to DirecTV has risen significantly: That $25 million a year became $50 million in 1998, then $200 million, $700 million, $1 billion, and finally the current $1.5 billion. Of DirecTV’s 22 million customers, an estimated 2 million subscribe to Sunday Ticket, paying an average of $300. The math is pretty ugly: DirecTV barely recoups half its Sunday Ticket costs. The broadcast networks and ESPN are losing money on their NFL deals, too. Not that they have much choice: The NFL is basically the single thing still capable of holding the pay-TV bundle together, or so most network executives seem to believe—and in the meantime, they still get to wallow in the gravy of football advertising dollars and have a platform to promote other shows on their network. As for DirecTV, it knows full well that if it were to ever lose Sunday Ticket, it would likely lose somewhere around 10% of its subscribers.Which brings me back to streaming. I was unable to get anyone from the NFL to talk to me about the league’s online strategy, but the sources I did speak with told me that one reason the league has been so reluctant to dive into streaming is that it understands its importance to the legacy networks and wants to protect them. Even the NFL’s deal with DirecTV is, in part, an effort to ensure that the networks’ football telecasts are protected. You can’t get your local game on Sunday Ticket; for that, you have to watch CBS or Fox. And the fact that only 2 million people watch via Sunday Ticket means that the rest of the country still has to rely on old-fashioned broadcast TV.“If you’re a football fan, you’re a bundled customer,” says Michael Nathanson, who follows the television industry for MoffettNathanson LLC. “That’s how the NFL makes its money. As much as the league wants to move outside that ecosystem, it also doesn’t want to disrupt its main source of revenue. It’s a difficult dance.”The chances of the NFL “disrupting” CBS or Fox by making the Sunday afternoon games widely available via streaming is slim to none. There’s just too much money at stake. Sunday and Monday Night Football will also likely remain on broadcast and cable television for the foreseeable future. Which leaves, well, Sunday Ticket.Everyone I spoke with is convinced that Sunday Ticket will be the vehicle the NFL will use to join the streaming revolution. The question remains what that will eventually look like. One possibility is that it could start its own streaming service, the way Major League Baseball did way back when. (That service, BAMTech, was so good that Disney acquired it in 2017 and plans to use it as the backbone for its ambitious upcoming online effort, Disney+. It is now known as Disney Streaming Services.) But this requires an enormous amount of expertise that the NFL doesn’t currently have, as well as time and money. (Just ask Disney.)A second possibility is that the NFL will stick with DirecTV and make OTT streaming part of the deal, allowing fans to watch without needing a DirecTV subscription. (Currently, fans can stream NFL games if they have a DirecTV subscription, or live in a building where satellite TV is not allowed.) NFL commissioner Roger Goodell recently told Sports Business Daily that the league is conducting talks with AT&T about extending the Sunday Ticket deal. “Obviously AT&T-DirecTV is a different company than when we struck the deal,” Goodell said. “The deal we have structured is a satellite-only deal, and so we'll continue to talk to them about whether that’s made available to a broader audience through other platforms—either through AT&T or otherwise, but those are things that we’ll continue to have discussions about. But I expect to be partners with them for the next several years at least.” Not exactly a ringing endorsement.What’s more, industry experts question how committed AT&T still is to DirecTV, especially now that it owns Time-Warner (now called WarnerMedia), which it bought last year for $85 billion. “It doesn’t seem to be a cornerstone of their business,” says Matthew Ball, an analyst of the evolving entertainment business who previously worked as the head of strategy for Amazon Studios. For AT&T, the new cornerstone is HBO, around which it is building its own streaming service. As for DirecTV, even with Sunday Ticket, it has been bleeding subscribers—544,000 just in the first quarter of this year. If that trend continues, it’s hard to imagine that AT&T can afford to keep throwing billions at the NFL.Which leaves Option 3: Find a dedicated streaming service to pay an exorbitant amount of money to carry Sunday Ticket and force whoever has the TV rights to accept a streaming competitor as part of the deal. I used to believe it was unlikely that any of the big Silicon Valley companies would be willing to pay the kind of money the legacy networks have long paid. My reasoning was that digital companies don’t need football the way the television networks do. Netflix, for example, has long said it is uninterested in live sports.But after talking to Skipper and others, I’ve revised my thinking. “If you are trying to launch something,” says Ball, “nothing has the predictability, as well as the volume of content, as the NFL.”It’s obvious what landing Sunday Ticket could do for DAZN—it would instantly transform it from a niche service into a major player in sports. DAZN already offers Sunday Ticket in Canada, as well as NFL games in Germany. If it could offer Sunday Ticket in the U.S., it would bestow instant credibility, just as the NFL did for Fox in 1994. And it would bring in millions of new subscribers willing to pay a premium price.But Disney has also started an OTT service for ESPN, called ESPN+. Right now, it airs only events that are not on ESPN or ESPN 2, such as forgettable college football games (Coastal Carolina v. Kansas) and tennis matches on the outer courts at the U.S. Open. Sunday Ticket would make ESPN+ a “must-have” for football fans.I suppose Google, Apple, or maybe even Facebook could make a play for NFL rights, but I’m more inclined to believe that Amazon.com Inc. wants the football. In 2017, Amazon signed a deal with the NFL allowing its Amazon Prime subscribers to stream a package of Thursday night games. Sunday Ticket would drive new Prime subscriptions like nothing else, while also drawing people to its fledgling original content. Amazon has plenty of money to pay the NFL. And, this being Amazon, it would likely use the data it gained from its new customers to put products in front of them that linked to their favorite team. Given the way the NFL operates—extracting maximum dollars from companies eager for its content—Option 3 strikes me as the most likely scenario.There is one other issue, though. For football fans who don’t get DirecTV, Sunday Ticket has long been a sore spot. In New York, for instance, marquee games are often unavailable because the region has two not-very-good teams that take up both Sunday slots at 1 p.m. and 4 p.m. It grates on them that they can stream every Major League Baseball game, but they can’t stream an out-of-market pro football game. (At least not legally; if you do a Google search, you’ll find a fair number of tips on how to get the games illegally.) There’s even a website, 506sports.com, that posts a map each week showing which area of the country can watch which NFL games. Fans go to the map every Sunday just to grit their teeth over the games they’re going to miss because they don’t have Sunday Ticket.In most industries, the company that is late to the internet usually gets punished for its lack of foresight. But that does not appear to be true in this case. Even though the NFL is miles behind other leagues in streaming its games, this is going to work to the league’s advantage. The pent-up demand is likely to cause a stampede of fans rushing to subscribe to whichever service ultimately lands Sunday Ticket. In which case, the NFL will win again. As usual.\"),\n",

       "  'Breaking down the boldest bets in businessThe chicken in Popeyes sandwich.PHOTOGRAPHER: NICK KINDELSPERGER/CHICAGO TRIBUNE/TNS VIA GETTY IMAGESPeople waited for hours in lines that stretched down the block. The food website Thrillist called it a “tiny miracle” and The New Yorker deemed it “fantastic.” There was no national ad campaign, no celebrity sponsorship, and yet people shared more than 40,000 Instagram posts and hundreds of thousands of tweets. All this for a $3.99 chicken sandwich from Popeyes. To understand what’s going on with Popeyes you have to first understand what’s going on with chicken. Chicken is cheaper than beef and theoretically healthier (though not if you fry it, of course). According to the National Chicken Council, the average American eats about 10 pounds more chicken than they did a decade ago. This poultry boon has helped revitalize KFC and turn Chick-fil-A into the third-largest restaurant chain in the U.S., behind only McDonald’s and Starbucks. Last year the average Chick-fil-A restaurant brought in about $4.6 million, more than three times that of the average KFC.Popeyes is nearly 50 years old but has never had the national presence as big as the top fast-food chains. It has roughly a third fewer stores than KFC, for example. But it does have some truly great fried chicken. In 2017, a California restaurant admitted that the $13 fried chicken entrée it served was actually just take-out that employees had ordered from the Popeyes down the street. Even Anthony Bourdain was a fan.Thanks to its superior product, the chain has been doing fine in recent years, but Chick-fil-A was beating it at its own game. What did its competition primarily sell? Fried chicken sandwiches. Popeyes needed a sandwich. And it needed a fight.The Popeyes sandwich soft launched in select locations months ago. It had a brioche bun, a thick layer of pickles, and it came with either mayonnaise or a spicy Cajun sauce. Early customers often tweeted how much better it was than Chick-fil-A. So this week Popeyes publicly unveiled it with a series of tweets that quickly dissolved into a passive-aggressive feud with Chick-fil-A’s Twitter account, which was happy to engage. Wendy’s, which sells several chicken sandwiches, awkwardly tried to get in on the action.Americans haven’t had a viral food frenzy for a while; the cronut is six years old, the Doritos-Locos taco, seven. Popeyes’ parent company, Restaurant Brands International, also owns Burger King, so in a way they’re also behind the recent Impossible Whopper attention. But soy protein concentrate can only generate so much excitement.That’s what makes the Popeyes sandwich campaign so smart. The product is cheap, delicious and the accompanying snarky Twitter fight gave people a reason to weigh in with their opinions, all tagged with #popeyessandwich. Popeyes hasn’t revealed this week’s sales figures yet, although given all the ‘Sold Out’ signs posted around the country, Felipe Athayde, Popeyes’ president for the Americas, probably wasn’t exaggerating when he called it “extraordinary.”Meanwhile, KFC and Chick-fil-A are about to go to war over Chick-fil-A’s new side dish: mac and cheese.'),\n",

       "  '2019-08-21',\n",
       "  'Anger over high housing prices fuels many protesters, and taking on wealthy landlords might appease them.Li Ka-shing, founder of CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd.Hong Kong’s richest man broke his silence on Aug. 16. Li Ka-shing, the nonagenarian founder of CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd., the city’s most important conglomerate, published statements in Chinese- and English-language newspapers urging a halt to the unrest wracking the territory.Li was the most prominent of a group of local property tycoons throwing their weight behind Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam’s calls for calm. Among those also making statements were Peter Woo, retired chairman of Wheelock & Co., one of the city’s largest landlords, and Henry Cheng, head of a property-to-jewelry empire that’s building a HK$20 billion ($2.6 billion) shopping-and-entertainment complex at the city’s airport. Meanwhile, Adam Kwok, executive director of Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd., the city’s largest developer, joined a pro-government rally on Aug. 17.Hong Kong’s billionaires have good reason to discourage the demonstrators. The tumult is hitting many of their businesses as tourists cancel their trips and stores along protest routes shut their doors. The economy will contract 0.3% this year, and property prices could decline up to 10% in the next 9-12 months, according to a Morgan Stanley forecast. There’s also the possibility that, once the unrest subsides, the government will take aim at policies that have helped property developers accumulate huge fortunes in a city where homeownership is out of reach for millions of ordinary people.Besides demanding universal suffrage and other political reforms, many of the protesters are frustrated with Lam’s inability to make the city more affordable. Addressing those concerns means challenging the property barons, according to Regina Ip, a pro-Beijing lawmaker who calls the current crisis “a turning point for Hong Kong.”The outsize role of a few family-owned conglomerates is a legacy of colonial rule. Under the British, land couldn’t be bought outright but had to be leased from the government, an arrangement that guaranteed a steady flow of revenue into state coffers. The system, which endured after the handover to China in 1997, constrained the supply of residential and commercial real estate, enriching a few well-connected local families such as the Lis.Hong Kong’s tycoons leveraged their money and connections to expand into such sectors as telecommunications, hotels, logistics, and retailing. They invested in projects across the border, winning the trust of leaders in Beijing and gaining perks such as seats on government bodies including the 1,194-member election committee that selected Lam to lead the Hong Kong government in 2017.Consensus is building across the political spectrum that the cozy relationship between property developers and Hong Kong’s rulers constitutes a threat to stability. Ever-rising real estate prices have widened the divide between the haves and have-nots, supplying additional fuel for the unrest, says David Dodwell, executive director of the Hong Kong-APEC Trade Policy Study Group, a local think tank. “The pressure is on the property barons,” he says. “Because housing is such a critical social issue now and emotionally distills the crisis, they are going to be in the firing line in a way that other sectors are not.”For Lam, shifting attention from her failed extradition bill toward economic reforms is an attractive option, according to one of her advisers. Her administration is working on proposals to address basic problems that previous governments have long neglected, says the adviser, who asked to remain anonymous because the discussions are confidential.Some developers have amassed large property holdings that they’ve yet to develop, exacerbating the housing crunch. Henderson Land Development Co. controls more than 45 million square feet of agricultural land, an area slightly larger than New York City’s Central Park, while Sun Hung Kai has an additional 31 million square feet. All this acreage could support tens of thousands of new homes, helping to bring down prices across much of the city.To spur construction of apartments, politicians say Lam should resort to a rarely used resumption law (akin to eminent domain) that allows the government to take back land and put it to public use. “The government has to explore every means to increase land supply,” says Starry Lee, chairwoman of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong, the city’s largest pro-Beijing party. “If they cannot engage in a healthy dialogue with the tycoons, then the government should resume the land.”“President Xi Jinping has said houses are for living in, not for speculation”Local property developers aren’t the only companies that could be affected. Hong Kong Disneyland, a venture between Walt Disney Co. and the local government, has an option for an additional 6.5 million square feet near the theme park, whose attendance projections have fallen short since doors opened in 2005. The lot set aside for an expansion of the park has been sitting vacant for years. It’s time for the government to take it back and develop it for public housing, Lee says.Many of Hong Kong’s conglomerates are better positioned than in the past to withstand challenges at home. CK Hutchison last year got 15% of its revenue and just 2% of its net income from Hong Kong, down from 21% of revenue and about 5% of profit in 2015. More than half of the group’s revenue and earnings comes from Europe, where its business units operate trains, telecommunications networks, and utilities. On Aug. 19, CK Asset Holdings agreed to pay £2.7 billion ($3.3 billion) for British pub, restaurant, and hotel operator Greene King Plc.Read more on Hong Kong’s unrest:Hong Kong’s superwealthy also have practice navigating policy turbulence. After years of debate, the city finally enacted a competition law in 2015, but opposition from business led lawmakers to water down the legislation before approving it, says Sandra Marco Colino, an associate professor at the law school of the Chinese University of Hong Kong. In the almost four years the statute has been in effect, the government has initiated only four cases.The scope for meaningful change may be limited by the political reality that Lam can’t afford to alienate a powerful constituency when millions of Hong Kong residents are calling for her resignation. “I still think the government is pretty conservative when it comes to policymaking,” says Tommy Wu, a senior economist in Hong Kong with Oxford Economics, who discounts the likelihood of major reform from Lam’s administration. “To me, it looks like they are tinkering on the margins.”On the other hand, Lam’s taking on the tycoons may ensure that she retains the support of China’s top leadership, which views rising income inequality as potentially destabilizing not only to Hong Kong but also to the mainland. “President Xi Jinping has said houses are for living in, not for speculation,” says Andrew Wan, a member of the legislature from the Democratic Party, which has called on Lam to step down. “Tackling Hong Kong developers would be in line with his views.”'),\n",

       "  '2019-08-21',\n",
       "  'A&E’s Live PD is the most-viewed show on cable, making the network one of the very few to show growth in 2019.Dan Abrams, host of A&E’s Live PD, and Paul Buccieri, president of A&E Networks Group, at the network’s New York studios.On a Saturday night in July in Salinas, Calif., officer Cameron Mitchell began pursuing a suspected stolen car. As a couple million TV viewers watched at home, Mitchell chased the vehicle over curbs and through crowded intersections. He attempted what’s known as a PIT maneuver, nosing his car into the side of the fleeing vehicle to get the driver to spin to a stop. But Mitchell instead lost control and his squad car skidded frighteningly to a halt on a median. In the end, the officer was fine and the suspect gave himself up a few blocks later after other Salinas police vehicles surrounded him.It’s all in a typical night on Live PD, the hit show that’s helped lift the fortunes of A&E Networks Group and is showing at least one way TV companies can survive competition from streaming services like Netflix. Continually switching between cameras recording the real-time exploits of officers in eight locations around the U.S., Live PD combines a classic TV staple—the police show—with live elements that many viewers find irresistible.“Crime is hot,” says Scott Robson, an analyst who follows television for S&P Global Market Intelligence, citing everything from crime-focused networks, such as Investigation Discovery, to the surge in serialized crime podcasts. Live PD added a new twist: unpredictability. “With the live format,” Robson says, “you never know what’s going to happen next.”Data: ShowBuzzDailyThe show, now in its third season, is often the No. 1 program on American cable TV on Friday and Saturday nights. A&E is one of only two cable channels to show growth in 18-to-49-year-old viewers since September 2018, along with TLC.A&E, jointly owned by Walt Disney Co. and Hearst Corp., runs six hours of new Live PD episodes a week. There are hours more of reruns and seven spinoffs, including Live PD Presents: Women on Patrol and Live Rescue, which focuses on firefighters and other first responders. Top Dog, which features police dogs competing on an obstacle course, is set to make its debut in the fall.In a way Live PD is a return to the network’s heyday six years ago when it thrived on red-state reality shows such as Duck Dynasty and Dog the Bounty Hunter. Programming at A&E—which had started out showcasing fine arts such as opera and classical dance in the 1980s—drifted after those reality hits ended, and the channel even toyed with scripted dramas. In 2017, less than a year after Live PD’s debut, A&E canceled all its scripted shows and went all-in on reality. Says A&E President Paul Buccieri: “We think we’ve struck a real opportunity with live unscripted storytelling.”“Let’s broadcast your worst day at work live on television”Live PD has flown largely under the radar of national media. That’s partly because police departments in New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago haven’t been interested in participating. “I think that more people in other parts of the country are probably touched by law enforcement,” says the show’s host, longtime network TV legal commentator Dan Abrams. “They have friends, relatives that are in some ways connected to it.”Live PD is the creation of Big Fish Entertainment, a production company acquired last year by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. Prior to Live PD, Big Fish was best known for shows such as VH-1’s tattoo parlor reality show Black Ink Crew. Company founder Dan Cesareo says his team got the idea for Live PD after reading an article about how police were streaming arrests on Twitter. The nation had been roiled by protests over police killings of unarmed suspects such as Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. Cesareo pitched the program to police chiefs as a way for the general public to see the whole story, not just clips that end up on the evening news. He’s still surprised so many said yes. “We were asking them to sign up for what could be their worst nightmare,” Cesareo says. “Let’s broadcast your worst day at work live on television.”A typical Live PD episode follows two officers each in eight cities or counties. A camera person rides in the cars, which are also equipped with cameras. Abrams hosts the show from A&E’s Manhattan headquarters, switching between live feeds to highlight whichever story seems most compelling. (An occasional segment is identified as having taken place “earlier,” which could mean hours or days.) Current and former police officers provide in-house analysis, while Abrams offers a steady stream of deadpan quips. “She wanted the UberX version of that car,” Abrams said one Friday night in August after a woman stopped for walking in the middle of a busy road in East Providence declined a ride in the back of a squad car. The officers put her in an ambulance instead.Live PD offers a mix of the mundane and the terrifying. In the first season, viewers watched a fleeing suspect flip his car and try to run holding his two-year-old daughter as a human shield. As the camera rolled and a crowd gathered with cellphones out, Richland County, S.C., sheriff’s deputy Chris Mastrianni wrestled the man for more than two minutes until backup arrived. At one point, the suspect reached into his pocket for what might have been a weapon.Richland County Sheriff Leon Lott was among the first to sign on to the show and he says he has no regrets. The department gets fan mail and job inquiries from across the country, he says. Some 5,000 fans came to Columbia, the county’s largest city, for a celebration of the 200th episode in April. “I think Live PD is the future of law enforcement,” says Lott. “Five to 10 years from now, everything that law enforcement does is going to be livestreamed somewhere. I saw this as an opportunity to get on the front end of something everybody’s going to be doing.”Some departments, including Bridgeport, Conn.’s, have stopped working with the show. And last year, the Spokane City Council passed an ordinance making it difficult for police shows to film there after some residents objected to how the city was portrayed.Dan Taberski, host of the Running from Cops podcast, which dissects the long-running syndicated show Cops, devoted a couple of episodes to Live PD earlier this year. Taberski’s team interviewed residents of Spokane and Tulsa who appeared on the show. They complained that police targeted them for minor infractions because they knew they’d make for good television and that the show never asked permission to feature them. “A show that presents itself as being transparent asks no hard questions of police,” Taberski says.Live PD producers say that if some of those being filmed object, their faces are blurred out. But mostly Cesareo says the show doesn’t need to get the subjects to sign releases to include them because the events are playing out in public, live.That immediacy keeps viewers engaged, as during an incident in June in Williamson County, Texas, where a man pulled over for a missing license plate and suspected of being intoxicated tried to run after officers asked him to get out of the car. It took four deputies, using their fists, a chokehold, and a taser to subdue him. Half the people watching probably thought the officers used too much force; half probably felt that it was justified, Cesareo says. “That’s the perfect moment for the show,” he says. “You want those discussions.”'),\n",

       "  'Media behemoths want to conquer a realm now dominated by the likes of Netflix. Think The Hunger Games.Anyone who wants to watch a dramatic, treacherous race in the months ahead should check out the escalating competition in the world of streaming video-on-demand TV. It promises to be the media industry’s equivalent of the Badwater Ultramarathon, the annual spectacle in which a steely group of endurance athletes gather in the arid lowlands of California and race uphill on foot for 135 miles. In the summertime. In Death Valley.By this time next year, AT&T’s WarnerMedia division, Comcast’s NBCUniversal, Walt Disney, and Apple will all have released sinewy new streaming video services, taking on the existing ones from Amazon.com, CBS, Hulu, and Netflix. It’s unlikely that any of these media and tech giants will escape this looming showdown unscathed. Even the ultimate winners are expected to limp into the future bloodied and battered. Next year “is shaping up to be The Hunger Games for the streaming services,” says Jamyn Edis, an adjunct associate professor at the New York University Stern School of Business.The media conglomerates are trying to win on Netflix Inc.’s turf now because they don’t have much choice. The success of Netflix’s model—charging a monthly fee for a large amount of ad-free, on-demand programming that streams to any internet-connected device—has inspired millions of people to cancel their pay-TV service and get their home entertainment online. At the same time, the telecommunications and tech industries have watched Netflix and Amazon Prime Video harvest vast amounts of valuable consumer data from their viewers and decided that starting a successful streaming service might be a great way to sell more of their existing products (phones for Apple Inc., wireless contracts for AT&T Inc.). The trick will be to persevere through the short-term hazards.Consider the myriad pitfalls of the course ahead.For decades, Disney, NBC, Time Warner, and other entertainment behemoths enjoyed a lucrative, straightforward business model. They packaged TV programs into channels, then sold them to consumers through cable and satellite distributors such as Comcast Corp. or DirecTV, which pass along recurring subscription fees even if few people are watching a particular channel. The networks collected billions of dollars from the advertising they served up during commercial breaks.The streaming world, on the other hand, has proved largely inhospitable to commercial interruptions. Netflix and Amazon Prime Video don’t have any. And both have toughed it out to dominate the market without needing advertising income. (Hulu LLC has a cheaper version of its service with limited commercials, but it’s started capping their length to avoid upsetting viewers.) The new entrants have to master the art of attracting and retaining loyal streaming subscribers to survive in the long run. It won’t be easy.In the days before streaming, if a media conglomerate had a lull in one of its network’s lineups, it was insulated from the resulting viewer apathy by big bundles of adjacent options. For example, a subscriber to Dish couldn’t cancel the Food Network without also ditching CNN, ESPN, and TNT, among hundreds of others. Even the process of canceling was unappealing. It required the hassle of calling a customer service rep trained to bob and weave and wear down would-be turncoats with enticing counteroffers.The dynamics of the new race are much less forgiving. The internet has made canceling streaming services easy. There are no calls, no resistant sales forces to overcome, no sacrificing of co-bundled products. To abandon one service in favor of another takes only a few clicks. As a result, a momentary dry spell in a streaming network’s lineup could trigger an outbreak of sudden departures.“If there’s any one traditional media company that can compete with Netflix, it’s Disney”Brett Sappington, an analyst with Parks Associates, a market research and consulting company, says that though annual cancellation rates among traditional cable and satellite distributors hover around 4%, surveys of consumers show that churn rates at streaming services tend to be significantly higher. Netflix, which has the lowest turnover rate of any streaming service, still loses about 7% of its existing subscribers each year, he says. It goes up from there. “The newest services are the ones that have the highest churn,” Sappington says.Not bound by long-term contracts, streaming subscribers can easily be lured away. In surveys, Parks Associates found that 28% of consumers said they have subscribed to a streaming service to check out just a single title.To retain subscribers and entice those of their rivals, the services will have to strive to stock both popular reruns and fresh batches of original programming, which will be hugely expensive. In preparation, the competitors are taking some drastic measures.Recently, Walt Disney Co.—the company with arguably the deepest, richest library of beloved characters and shows on the planet—decided its programming stockpile still wasn’t robust enough and paid $71 billion for the bulk of 21st Century Fox. Earlier this year, Disney agreed to pay at least $5.8 billion to Comcast to take over full control of Hulu. CBS Corp. has introduced several original series exclusively for its online channel, CBS All Access. These include Star Trek: Discovery, which costs $8 million on average per episode, making it one of the most expensive shows in TV history, according to Variety.In search of a universally irresistible attraction, Amazon.com Inc. acquired the rights to make a TV series based on The Lord of the Rings, paying some $250 million before a single script has been written, an actor hired, or a bucolic hamlet commandeered. WarnerMedia is developing a sumptuous Game of Thrones prequel for HBO. Apple has enlisted TV help from Steven Spielberg and Oprah. In April, Disney said it plans to spend more than $1 billion on original programming in fiscal 2020 for Disney+, which is scheduled to begin in November. The company doesn’t expect the service to turn a profit until 2024.At the same time, Netflix has been expanding the scope of the race by investing heavily in video infrastructure, production, and talent in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and Europe. While amassing more than 150 million subscribers globally, the company has also been locking down Hollywood talent, signing proven performers and show creators to exorbitantly high-priced, multiyear deals ($300 million for showrunner Ryan Murphy), and daring competitors to keep up. Many maneuvers are double-edged. Netflix has paid Chris Rock $40 million for a pair of performances, simultaneously wooing comedy fans to subscribe while also sticking a knife in the tire of its rival HBO, where Rock was long the face of stand-up comedy.“Netflix is very far ahead of the game with so much popular content and a brand name and a position in people’s lives,” says Tim Nollen, an analyst at Macquarie Group. “If there’s any one traditional media company that can compete with Netflix, it’s Disney. They have consumer awareness and content that people will pay for. That doesn’t mean Disney wins and Netflix loses. It means that Disney is one of the few that can successfully play that same game.”The costs of entering the streaming race are no less daunting. For years the traditional media companies were able to lessen the blow of declining DVD sales and rentals, in part, by leasing their shows to Netflix and Amazon. Now the days of raking in this easy money are winding down, as media companies buy back the streaming rights to their classic shows and movies. For the exclusive rights to Friends, which will stream on the company’s HBO Max service, AT&T is paying $85 million a year. NBC has agreed to spend $100 million a year for the rights to The Office. The popular reruns of both shows have been streaming on Netflix.“No one’s going to compete with Netflix in terms of gross subscribers. I believe they have won the game”Standing out from the pack of competitors won’t be easy. Last year, Netflix spent $2.4 billion on marketing—that’s roughly HBO’s entire programming budget for 2017. Over the years, Netflix has tried every kind of gimmick to get attention. It’s bought a pricey Super Bowl ad, paid for myriad billboards along the Sunset Strip in Hollywood, distributed stickers depicting rolled-up dollar bills and faux lines of cocaine in public bathrooms nationwide to promote the show Narcos, planned a print magazine, created “smart” socks designed to pause viewers’ TV if they fall asleep in the middle of a show, and deployed a bunch of Stranger Things-branded pedicabs to ride through New York blasting ’80s music.Expect the din to grow louder. “If you’re Disney, you can put a flyer in every hotel room in every park at all of your properties and resorts,” Sappington says. “If you’re AT&T, you have all of your communication and wireless platforms. That’s going to be a big part of it. How are you going to make noise for yourself in a crowded market?”The maintenance costs will also be hefty. Going direct-to-consumer will require the media giants to handle all sorts of messy tasks such as customer service and billing that they have long relegated to their distribution partners. They’ll also need to hire legions of technology experts, including data scientists, software engineers, and product designers, to build and maintain their streaming platforms. None of which is cheap. Just ask Disney, which has spent about $2.6 billion acquiring a majority ownership of BAMTech, a company specializing in streaming technology.Some media companies have sized up the frightening terrain and decided to sit out this one. In 2018 an analyst at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s annual Communacopia Conference asked Bob Bakish, chief executive officer of Viacom Inc.—which owns a slate of youth-oriented TV networks including Comedy Central, MTV, and Nickelodeon—about his company’s plans to enter the direct-to-consumer space. Bakish was not bullish. “What we’re not doing is developing a mass-market, [subscription video-on-demand] service, like Netflix,” Bakish said. “And the reason for that is twofold. One is that that business is looking more and more crowded. And the second thing is it’s a very capital-intensive game.”Translation: Have fun with your cannonball run. We’ll be happy to make deals with whomever eventually survives.Others have been scared off as well. For years, executives at IAC/InterActive Corp., the New York-based media conglomerate, said its video platform Vimeo was going to introduce a subscription video-on-demand service offering a slate of original programming similar to Netflix. But then in 2017, after a prolonged reconnaissance mission, the company announced it was backing out. Recently, IAC Chairman Barry Diller described Netflix as essentially unbeatable. “No one’s going to compete with Netflix in terms of gross subscribers,” Diller told CNBC in July. “I believe they have won the game.”In truth, the race is just getting started, and the treachery of the landscape is such that even Netflix is not safe from painful stumbles. Earlier this year the company raised its prices, in part, to help pay for its massive investments in programming, which reached $12 billion in 2018. The price hike did not go unpunished. In July, Netflix disclosed that during the second quarter it had suffered a net loss of U.S. subscribers for the first time in eight years. Shares plunged, erasing more than $24 billion from its market value over the next six days.As peak TV ventures into the arid valley ahead, expect to see plenty more moments of distress. Bon voyage, streaming service executives. Please hydrate accordingly.'),\n",

       "  'Daniel Meng of Bismarck, N.D., prepares his pieces for the championship contest.Every two years, the world’s taxidermists gather to show off their best work.On a stormy day in Springfield, Mo., the Expo Center was full of menacing bears, jumping lions, flying birds, and swimming fish, all remaining pretty still as they got their hair blow-dried, feathers tweaked, or scales retouched.Every other year since 1983, taxidermists from all over the world gather for the World Taxidermy and Fish Carving Championships. Since the 1990s, it has been organized by Larry Blomquist, owner and publisher of the taxidermy magazine Breakthrough.“You need a lot of skills to be a good taxidermist,” he says, “a good knowledge of anatomy, habitat, sculpting, sewing, painting, and have a very creative mindset to come up with the piece to look alive and tell a story. A good taxidermist is an artist.”About 30 judges, two for each category ranging from Large Mammals to Reptiles, walk among the entries. In front of a very stoic rabbit being attacked by a lynx, a judge comments: “He looks like he is getting a back-scratch. This is not realistic.”“A good piece needs to display emotion; this is what makes it stands out,” says Wendy Christensen, who has been a judge for 25 years. “But it also needs to be anatomically correct.” To check accuracy, judges run their fingers through fur, inspect teeth with a flashlight, and compare pieces with reference photos.A winning entry can take, on average, 150 hours to be completed and eventually sell for $10,000 to $20,000.This year the Best of Show did not have fur or feathers. For the first time in the championship’s history, the top prize was awarded to a large, majestic fish called a muskellunge—better known as a “muskie”—created by Tim Gorenchan from Escanaba, Mich.Next door to the competition is one of the largest trade shows in the taxidermy industry. Vendors populating 166 booths sell glass eyes and such other artificial parts as noses, jaws, and reproduction turkey heads, or display habitat, such as fake rocks and tree branches.Allis Markham, a taxidermist based in Los Angeles, has been giving classes for several years in the hope of making taxidermy more popular in urban areas and among women. She says 95% of her students are women. One of her former students, Lauren Crist, a full-time animator for Disney, won first place with her blue jay this year.The competition also includes a category for newcomers no older than 14.“My daughter is only 7,” says Ashley Barrett, a four-time contestant who won this year’s Best in World for his mountain lion. “But she is already interested in what I am doing. We might try to work on a piece together this summer—maybe a deer head.” '),\n",

Then one put a price on his head.When the FBI showed up at the door of his penthouse in Miami Beach, fashion photographer Baruch Vega was drinking merlot with a group of models, stylists, and assistants. The group had just returned from two weeks of shoots in Puerto Rico and Cancún. They were preparing for another in Jamaica the next day.It was March 21, 2000. Vega was 53 and feeling like he’d hit his prime. Trim and tan, he owned a nine-seat Hawker jet and was a fixture at South Beach’s trendy restaurants—always wearing a tight black T-shirt and surrounded by beautiful women. He was thinking of trying to make one of them his fourth wife.But this fabulous life was actually a cover. Although none of his four daughters or his fashion friends knew it, Vega was a freelance spy working for the U.S. government. He’d insinuated himself into the social circles of Colombia’s cocaine kingpins. And even as he provided information to the U.S., Vega was also running a con. Between photo shoots, he’d talked some of the world’s most dangerous drug traffickers—including a former gunman for Pablo Escobar—into agreeing to pay him more than $100 million.Vega had the narcos convinced he was close with corrupt members of the all-powerful U.S. government “Blitz Committee,” an interagency task force, and could, for a price, make their legal problems go away. As far as the cartel members could tell, Vega was legit. Once they paid him, the rules of the drug war seemed not to apply. Men wanted for murder were waved through customs. Criminals and Drug Enforcement Administration agents visited strip clubs together. One known trafficker threw a party on a yacht in Miami to mark the millennium. Another went to Disney World.Drug traffickers were such regular visitors to Vega’s penthouse, he wasn’t alarmed when one, who went by El Médico (“The Doctor”), rang his doorbell that evening. El Médico wanted to discuss the $7 million he’d paid Vega. He said the FBI knew about it and had been asking who got paid off. Vega tried to wave off the questions, saying he’d just spent the money, and El Médico left seemingly satisfied.Vega didn’t know it, but the FBI was listening. Around 9:30 p.m., as his group was about to head out for dinner, agents showed up. Vega stayed calm, offered the FBI agents wine, and told his friends to go on and order him a veal chop.The agents refused the wine. They ordered Vega to sit, put on latex gloves, and started searching his apartment. Vega made a show of trying to help, directing them to a camera case stuffed with more than $400,000 in cash. He said the money was part of his work for the DEA. But the agents didn’t buy it. They questioned him for hours. Early the next morning, they told him he was under arrest. He was charged with money laundering and obstruction of justice. The FBI claimed he’d taken cash from dealers and interfered with investigations. The next week, agents raided the DEA’s Miami headquarters and hauled out the computers and notebooks of anyone who had anything to do with Vega. It looked like one of the biggest scandals in the history of the drug war.And then the case was dropped, no explanation given. Twenty years on, Vega is eager to explain why and tell his story. Like a kind of narco Forrest Gump, he recalls crossing paths with all the major players. He says he delivered drug money to Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega and flirted with Escobar’s wife. He trained DEA agents to pose as his photography assistants and used models to recruit cartel members as informants. And then there was the time Medellín capo José Gonzalo Rodríguez Gacha threatened him by showing him two severed hands floating in a bucket of blood.Vega was, according to Vega, one of the most successful undercover operatives of all time—a spy whose charm, cunning, and cool under pressure were matched only by his skill with the ladies. He admits to swindling traffickers, but insists he did so on behalf of the DEA.As crazy as these claims seem, most are backed up by internal DEA documents and thousands of pages of court records from the trials of traffickers that have taken place since. In interviews, two dozen federal agents, prosecutors, and defense lawyers, as well as one very angry former cartel boss, contend that Vega did something so audacious it shouldn’t have been possible: He simultaneously conned two of the most dangerous organizations in the world, Colombia’s fearsome Norte del Valle cartel and the U.S. government.“It became such a mess that the government as a whole just said f---ing bury this,” says Paul Craine, who was a DEA agent in Bogotá in the late ’90s. “If we try to unravel this, we’re going to have to prosecute FBI agents, DEA agents, prosecutors. It was so crazy, where do you even start?”I found Vega through an online photo portfolio stamped with his personal logo—an intertwined B and V—and featuring page after page of pouty-lipped women in skimpy swimsuits. I wrote to ask if he might be interested in discussing his undercover years. He was. We talked for hours on the phone, then at a bar at the Four Seasons Hotel in New York.“We were really able to dismantle the biggest drug trafficking operation in history,” he said and took a sip of wine.Now 72, Vega stands about 5-foot-10, with buzzed gray hair and a deeply lined face. He joked that he looks like a Shar-Pei, but he’s still handsome. Within minutes of my arrival, he was hitting on the waitress. He’s also fond of superlatives: Models are “spectacularly stunning,” rich people are “mega-multibillionaires.” He was in Manhattan, he told me, to raise money for a cryptocurrency venture.Born in Bogotá, Vega claimed he was recruited as a teenager by the CIA to infiltrate radical student groups. (The agency doesn’t reveal its informants, but two federal agents confirmed that Vega did at least some work for the CIA.) He got into photography around the same time, at first as a way to meet women. He’d approach them on the street and ask to take their picture. Once he was shooting, he’d tell them how beautiful they’d look naked. In Vega’s telling, passion would take over. “They were so ready to explode,” he told me. “For them, it was a tremendous escape.”Vega said he quit the CIA in the mid-’70s and moved to New York, where he started a modeling agency, Intramodel Beauty. He also befriended a crack-smoking Venezuelan hit man, Rafael Rodriguez, better known by his alias, Amilcar. Vega partied at Studio 54, jumped into Champagne-filled hot tubs at Miami’s Mutiny Hotel, and helped Amilcar’s cartel buddies launder some of their money. Drugs were everywhere. “If they did not offer you cocaine, you would say this was a low-class event,” Vega said. He added that he never partook.He also never entirely trusted Rodriguez, and when the hit man admitted to killing some of their mutual friends as part of a turf war among Miami’s cocaine cowboys, Vega went to the police. (Rodriguez pleaded guilty to murder and died in prison.)Vega’s new friends in law enforcement came in handy in 1985. He was in a tight spot financially—a flamboyant tax shelter promoter with two mischievous pet monkeys had scammed him out of most of the money he’d made selling the modeling agency. (The story is so outlandish, I wouldn’t have believed it, but the dispute, along with the monkeys, shows up in court records and newspaper articles from the time.) Vega’s law enforcement acquaintances proposed that he could work as a paid informant for them. That sounded exciting. And Vega’s lifestyle wasn’t cheap. Models, he said, “need private jets, mansions, major hotels. That’s the difference between a model and a regular woman.”That was the start of Vega’s lucrative career in the drug wars. He never told his family what he was up to, not even when one of his daughters, a child actress, was preparing to star in the movie Spy Kids. “My parents can’t be spies,” her character in the movie says when she learns about their double life. “They’re not cool enough.”In 1989, President George H.W. Bush gave an Oval Office speech during which he held up a bag of crack and declared war on drug trafficking. America was being ravaged by drug use, he said, and in Colombia, “cocaine killers” were murdering judges and politicians with impunity. “Our message to the drug cartels is this: The rules have changed,” Bush said. He announced $2 billion in funding for international drug policing.The push gave cops in both countries the leeway to target kingpins, sometimes in ways that pushed ethical and legal boundaries. It also provided ample opportunities for corruption, which Vega turned out to have a knack for exploiting. In the early 1990s he persuaded his handlers in Florida to give him a confiscated ranch to help him establish a new cover, as a money laundering breeder of high-end Paso Fino horses. A cartel member would give Vega, say, $2 million in dirty cash, and then “sell” him a horse in exchange for a check and a phony receipt. Vega would take a cut. The horses were a bonus—“very lovely,” he recalls.In 1997, after the ranch operation ended, Vega met a rising DEA star named David Tinsley. At 42, Tinsley was sharply dressed, zealous, and eager to take risks. Former colleagues say he had special permission from the Justice Department to run an operation in which his informants posed as crooked financiers and laundered millions of dollars for traffickers. The fees they charged gave him a slush fund to pay for expenses the government wouldn’t normally cover—faster cars, nicer hotel rooms, fancier restaurants. Tinsley declined to comment for this story.Tinsley told Vega he wanted to take down the biggest, baddest cartel. That meant Norte del Valle, which exported $1 billion of cocaine a year from its labs in the jungles of western Colombia and was protected by a violent paramilitary army. In particular, Tinsley wanted to go after Danilo González, one of the most powerful police commanders in Colombia, whom he suspected was secretly working for the cartel, according to a memo he wrote to his bosses in 1999. González gained fame as a leader of Search Bloc, an elite police squad that had tracked down and killed Pablo Escobar in 1993, but he was rumored to have worked closely with Escobar’s underworld enemies.Tinsley’s strategy was to cultivate informants using the threat of U.S. extradition. He told Vega he’d be willing to offer reduced sentences to criminals who flipped. The problem was that in Colombia, even being suspected of talking to police was a good way to die. A Norte del Valle boss, Diego Montoya, routinely tortured and murdered suspected turncoats, his secretary testified in a 2011 trial, adding that he’d have videos of the killings delivered to his hideout. “All snitches, snitching sons of bitches, need to be killed,” Montoya would say, according to the assistant.Vega, ever the hustler, saw an opportunity. Cutting a deal with federal agents may have been taboo within the cartels, but paying off federal agents definitely wasn’t. The cartel did it all the time in Colombia. So Vega suggested that he fly to Colombia and attempt to solicit bribes. He’d tell the traffickers he knew high-level people in the U.S. government who, for a few million dollars, would ensure them a sweetheart plea deal. Plead guilty, serve a minimal sentence, then retire in Miami. No snitching required.“Living at the beach, nobody chasing you, nobody trying to kill you, with the blessing of the U.S. government, what else do you want for you and your family?” Vega says, summarizing the pitch. “It was a business proposition that nobody says no to.”Of course, to make it all work the traffickers would have to meet with the DEA after paying the bribe and sign a standard cooperation agreement. Vega would tell them they didn’t have to rat out their friends—they could just put some cocaine on a boat and tell the DEA where to find it. That was a lie: The DEA agents would eventually start demanding names of associates or asking for real smuggling routes. But the beauty of the trap was that the traffickers wouldn’t be able to tell anyone about what happened without revealing they’d flipped. Instead of denouncing Vega as a double-crosser, his marks would brag about how well the bribes worked. The more people Vega conned, the more credibility his system would gain, and the more former marks he’d have as salesmen. It would be like a pyramid scheme of snitches.“Man, that’s going to get you killed,” David Lemoine, a retired FBI agent, recalls telling Vega at the time. But Vega says Tinsley thought it was genius. He gave Vega a code name, Dr. B, and assigned a junior agent named Larry Castillo to be his primary contact. (Castillo didn’t return calls, emails, or letters from Bloomberg Businessweek.) Vega says Tinsley promised him a reward for each informant he recruited and gave him permission to use the bribe money to finance the operation’s expenses—a claim Tinsley would later dispute. If there was some money left over, Vega would count that as well-earned hazard pay.“I used to call it my retirement,” Vega says, grinning. “A healthy retirement, I’ll tell you.”One of the first people Vega reeled in was Arturo Piza, a retired smuggler who ran an antiques shop in Medellín. Piza knew everyone in the cocaine business, and his store became Vega’s meeting place. Piza led Vega to Julio Correa, a ponytailed former gunman for Escobar who was dating the most famous model in Colombia. Correa paid Vega more than $1 million, according to records from the DEA’s investigation into Vega’s scheme, and helped Vega bring in a second Escobar associate, who agreed to pay $1 million upfront and $7 million later.Over a few months in 1999, Vega perfected his sales pitch. He would show prospects a laptop full of official-looking organizational charts and warn them about the horrible punishments they might face if they were caught. Then he’d invite them to join a U.S. government initiative, the Drug Trafficker Resocialization Program.The name was made up, but it worked marvelously. Traffickers who’d already paid would recruit informants on Vega’s behalf. Some of these interactions were captured on secret recordings that were later revealed in court. “Someone is opening a side door for us, how are we not going to want to take that way out?” one trafficker said. “Brother, what’s the difference between five years and the rest of one’s life?” an informant asked a fellow narco. “The difference is Baruch. As simple as that.”Vega’s “clients,” as he called the informants who’d paid him bribes, seemed to confirm Tinsley’s suspicions about González, the police commander. They said the Norte del Valle cartel paid him to get information on operations and shared rumors that cops were participating in kidnappings and executions. Another Vega snitch gave the U.S. information that led to the seizure of 9,000 kilos of cocaine hidden in the mast of a ship. Tinsley claimed it was the second-largest maritime seizure in history.By early 1999, some drug lords began to suspect Vega wasn’t what he seemed. One kingpin Vega says he met with was murdered in prison. And in March, Piza, the antiques dealer, was assassinated in front of his wife by gunmen on motorcycles. An FBI agent warned Vega there was a price on his head, the agent would later tell DEA investigators. Vega says his trafficker friends told him González wanted him dead. He stopped traveling to Colombia to stay safe.In October 1999, Vega heard from his DEA handlers that something big was going down. He says they told him to tell the traffickers he was trying to flip to lie low for a few days. He called Piza’s widow and told her to spread the word.The tip was accurate. Before dawn on Oct. 13, 1999, hundreds of DEA agents and Colombian police officers raided the homes of traffickers across the country. In Medellín, surveillance planes made sure the coast was clear before truckloads of agents cruised into a kingpin’s ranch to grab him. Other officers in Bogotá smashed through a plate glass window at a trafficker’s mansion, interrupting an all-night birthday party. All told, 32 were arrested. Operation Millennium, as it was known, was one of the biggest busts since the Escobar takedown.Vega’s tipoff almost blew the entire thing, according to the Bogotá-based DEA agents who ran it. To prevent leaks by corrupt cops, they’d kept Millennium secret until the last minute. Even the Colombian officials who went on the raids were told they were gathering for professional development seminars. But Vega’s DEA handlers in Miami had known about it days earlier. Three or four traffickers evaded arrest because of the intel. The DEA agents in Bogotá were furious with their Miami counterparts when they found out their colleagues had used Vega to undermine them. “Somebody should have went to prison for this,” says Craine, one of the Bogotá DEA agents.Instead, Vega’s antics made him even wealthier. The tipoffs gave him credibility with the cartel, and the increased risk of extradition posed by Operation Millennium made his “resocialization program” more appealing. So many narcos were calling him that he decided to arrange a kind of narcos-and-agents convention in Panama City, a neutral location where Vega wouldn’t have to worry about hit men.He bought a Hawker jet so he and the traffickers could travel in style, and, a week after the raids, flew to Panama. He was joined by Correa, his Colombian informant-turned-recruiter, and Correa’s model girlfriend. Fans swarmed them at the airport, according to Daniel Forman, a defense lawyer who flew in with Vega. Dozens of traffickers, relatives, and lawyers were waiting for them at the oceanfront InterContinental Miramar Panama hotel, where Vega had booked an entire floor of suites. “We were on top of the world,” Vega says. “Everybody believed we were doing miracles.”Vega met with the traffickers in their hotel suites and delivered the resocialization pitch. Once they bought it, he’d walk them down the hall where a group of Miami DEA agents waited. Carlos Ramón Zapata—El Médico—agreed to pay $42 million to cover himself and some relatives. He gave Vega a $7 million down payment.To celebrate, Vega took his clients and some agents to a strip club and paid dancers to party with them. His handler, Castillo, hooked up with a friend of Zapata’s, he later admitted to internal affairs.At one point, Vega took a break from the conference to fly a trafficker who was wanted for murder in Colombia to Miami to surrender. Vega says the CIA helped smuggle him through customs. But once they were through, Vega’s handlers told him DEA agents from Bogotá were heading to Panama City to make arrests. Vega flew back through the night and hustled the fugitives out of the hotel just in time.Later, he met with Castillo and a DEA agent from Bogotá, Nicholas Kolen. Vega described his bribery scheme. Kolen listened—and was incredulous that Vega clearly didn’t think he was doing anything wrong. “It was surreal,” Kolen recalls. “They were dumb enough to give that spiel in front of me.”Kolen told Vega and Castillo to shut down their operation. They ignored him. Vega ran another convention the next month, then one in December. In January he lured his biggest target yet to Panama: Luis Hernando Gómez Bustamante, better known as Rasguño (“Scratch”), one of the top bosses of the Norte del Valle cartel and “the Pablo Escobar of his generation,” according to U.S. prosecutors. Vega says Rasguño didn’t flinch when he asked for $50 million.Rasguño gave Vega and his handlers a clearer picture of González. He said the police commander was secretly a high-level member of the cartel. Vega says Tinsley was thrilled with the intelligence. With Rasguño’s help, they might be able to bring the whole cartel down.Vega’s enemies on both sides of the law were already trying to stop his scheme. Kolen and the other DEA agents in Bogotá complained to headquarters about how their colleagues in Miami were sabotaging their work. One prosecutor in South Florida, Theresa Van Vliet, heard that Vega was bragging he’d bought her off. She called Tinsley, irate. “Get your informant under control,” she later recalled yelling at him.Fabio Ochoa, a kingpin who was arrested in Operation Millennium, also became a problem. Vega asked his family, who’d run the Medellín cartel with Escobar, for $30 million to fix the case. They didn’t take the deal. Instead, they taped the pitch and sent the recordings to the Justice Department.In Miami, prosecutors confronted Vega’s client, El Médico. They told him he’d been conned and suggested he could get a reduced sentence if he helped run a sting on Vega. At the Miami penthouse just before the raid, while Vega was unwinding with his friends, and in other meetings, El Médico got Vega to admit, on tape, to receiving about $3.5 million from Rasguño, among other payments, according to an FBI affidavit. That was all the evidence they needed to arrest him.Vega says he expected Tinsley or his other law enforcement friends to clear up what he thought was just a misunderstanding. They never did. He spent 52 days in jail before making bail. The U.S. seized $1.5 million—all of Vega’s cash the feds could find. The arrest blew his cover, and drug traffickers stopped making the payments they’d promised.Vega tried to fight the charges publicly, giving interviews to reporters about all the good work he’d done persuading narcos to surrender. The magazine Gatopardo called him El Encantador de Serpientes (“the Snake Charmer”), and ABC News called him “Secret Agent Man.” The Wall Street Journal quoted an anonymous U.S. agent who called Vega “our principal weapon” against the Colombian cartels.The case was a law enforcement scandal, but it was even more disruptive to the cocaine trade, since it revealed the man many believed to be their mole inside the DEA to have been, instead, a triple agent. The Norte del Valle cartel splintered as bosses accused each other of flipping. One cartel associate who was working with the FBI, Jhon Jairo Garcia Giraldo, was lured to a farm, dismembered, and then tossed in a river, according to U.S. prosecutors. The relatives of another member who testified in the U.S. were hacked to pieces with chainsaws. Correa, Vega’s model-dating client, disappeared in Colombia; paramilitaries would later admit to having incinerated his body. The intracartel feud inspired a novel, El Cartel de los Sapos (“Cartel of the Snitches”), and a telenovela based on the book.Vega was worried he’d be next. He regularly heard rumors about traffickers who wanted revenge, and he faced deportation to Colombia if convicted. He lost his penthouse, and his jet was repossessed. He stayed in relatives’ homes, motels, and truck stops. At one low moment, he had to sell a Hasselblad camera lens worth thousands for $100 just to buy gas.But the worst thing, Vega says, was that shortly after the raid, federal agents ransacked his storage unit, dumping 11 cabinets on the floor and destroying his photo archive. Vega says when he found out, it was the saddest day of his life. The photos had nothing to do with the case. “I cried. I cried so much,” he says. “The only things that were there were mega-gorgeous, spectacular-looking women.”In 2003, Vega’s old enemy González got in touch out of the blue. The cop told Vega that U.S. authorities were preparing a case against him and he needed help brokering a deal. González knew Vega’s program was fake, but at least the photographer had contacts with the DEA. Vega fell back into his old role, meeting González in Aruba in April 2003. They talked for hours at a poolside bar, while Vega secretly taped the encounter. He says that when he confronted González about the murder of Piza, the antiques dealer, and the contract on Vega’s head, González seemed to accept responsibility. “We were in the middle of a war,” González said, according to Vega. “We did what we had to do to protect ourselves.”Vega turned the information over to prosecutors, but before González could reach a deal, he was killed. In March 2004 a hit squad ambushed him at his lawyer’s office in Bogotá. Diego Montoya, the Norte del Valle cartel boss, had offered a $3 million reward for the assassination, because he heard González was snitching, according to court testimony by José Carlos Robayo Escobar, one of the hit men. “He was a criminal just like we were,” Robayo said.On the day González was shot, Vega was in a Miami courtroom. Prosecutors had reduced the charges to a willful failure to file an income tax return, and Vega had decided to plead guilty. In court, Vega begged the judge not to deport him. He said he was a U.S. patriot and that his arrest was the result of a conspiracy. He admitted to taking some drug money but said he needed it to cover expenses. “This was a self-financed operation,” Vega told the judge. “That’s why the government allowed us to have certain money. Of course I enjoyed that money. I was risking my life every day.”The judge recommended Vega be allowed to stay in the country to protect his safety and sentenced him to time served. Vega was a free man.The DEA’s final report on the scandal, which was posted online by Narco News, showed that Vega’s operation had violated DEA rules in every possible way. But it also included testimony suggesting that Vega’s handlers had been aware of the scheme despite their denials. Vega claimed an FBI agent helped him invent the system in the ’80s. The investigators tracked down Vega’s old FBI handler, Robert Levinson, who confirmed the story. Levinson said he let Vega keep any money he charged traffickers for himself. Vega’s FBI source file showed one gave Vega $50,000 and a Jaguar sports car as a retainer, and that Escobar’s cartel paid Vega $15,000. (Levinson disappeared in Iran in 2007 while on what the CIA called a “rogue” mission.)One person involved in the case, who spoke on condition of anonymity, explained that the U.S. was in an impossible situation. If it prosecuted Vega for the scheme, he’d be able to call everybody involved in his operation to the stand. Even if the government could show that Tinsley hadn’t given Vega permission to solicit bribes, it would be hard to convict an informant who had a plausible claim that he was simply doing his job. And the trial would be a public embarrassment for the DEA and the FBI.Tinsley, suspended during the internal affairs investigation, was reinstated in 2004, as was Castillo, the young agent who traveled with Vega to the conventions. “I thought they had suffered enough,” says Tom Raffanello, who took over as head of the DEA’s Miami office after the scandal. “Nobody can control any informant 24-7.” Tinsley retired from the DEA four years later and now runs a private security firm that calls itself “the first and only Judeo-Christian intelligence agency.”Vega’s claim that he could sell get-out-of-jail-free cards was a lie. But it also turned out to be sort of true. His clients—at least the ones who weren’t murdered—are free because Vega tricked them into snitching. None had to serve more than six years in prison. Some have returned to Colombia, while others live in South Florida. Ochoa, the kingpin who refused to pay and informed on Vega, got a decades-long sentence. He’s not scheduled for release until 2026.“He is a big, big liar,” Ochoa says in a phone call from a federal prison in Georgia. “He manipulates people. He likes to feel so important.”Meanwhile, the Operation Millennium arrests, and the war of the snitches that followed, did permanently change the drug trade. The Norte del Valle cartel never recovered. After González’s death, the leaders of the other factions were captured and brought to the U.S. Other, less violent traffickers eventually rose to take their place.Today, Vega lives in Maui in a modest house near the ocean. Craine, the Bogotá DEA agent, who is now retired, estimates that the photographer’s swindle generated $50 million. But Vega says that the total was much less and that he blew it all on wine, jets, and other model-related expenses. He says he didn’t stash any in offshore accounts—despite 20 years of experience doing just that as an undercover money launderer. “Without being presumptuous, I think I am one of the top money launderers who ever worked for the government,” Vega says. “But I have something that is called integrity.”Vega still does the occasional photo shoot—this spring he photographed models on a beach for a German clothing catalog—and claims he gets called on for “highly classified” missions by his friends in Washington. He’s revising a memoir. In it, he’s not a con man. He’s an irresistible lover and a crime-fighting international man of mystery. His drug-trafficker clients are happy with his services, and his scheme ends the drug war and brings peace to Colombia.Vega tells me this is true, all of it. A few times during our talks, though, he hints that I shouldn’t necessarily take him at his word. “A story has three sides—your side, my side, and the truth,” Vega says. “And no one is lying.” '),\n",

       "  '2019-06-21',\n",
       "  '“I wish I had known earlier how well I would be accepted.”As the LGBTQ community this month celebrates the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall uprising that marked the beginning of the modern gay rights movement, nowhere has the landscape changed more than in business. Coming out used to be a career-ender at many companies; today, major corporations compete for bragging rights about their opportunities for gays and lesbians. That’s bringing a new type of diversity to executive suites.I wish I had known earlier how well I would be accepted by my colleagues at Dow. I would have come out earlier, and my decision would have been far easier. I feared a lot of negativity that never came to fruition.I got a lesson in simply treating people—all people—equally early in my career when I was in sales. I had an African American colleague who was being discriminated against by one of our customers who didn’t want to work with him. Even at the risk of losing a customer, Dow’s regional VP jumped in a car, drove with my colleague to the customer’s headquarters, and told them that this was our guy and if they wanted to work with Dow they’d work with him. That was over 30 years ago, and I still remember it as a pivotal moment in understanding how important it was to treat everyone with respect and what an impact that support can have for the individual and the entire company.I’d advise any young LGBTQ person to do two things. First, look for a company that mirrors your own beliefs. There are plenty of companies that live their values, that actively support minorities and LGBTQ individuals, and that will support you. Find them. Second, don’t be afraid to live your own life. I would never tell anyone to come out when they don’t feel comfortable, but I know from experience there is a toll you pay when you try to hide part of yourself, and that the perceived pain of coming out is often worse than the reality.I didn’t come out until I was fairly high in the organization. Part of the reason for coming out so late in my career was my fear—unwarranted fear, it turns out—of how I might be accepted. Then again, it’s easier today for younger LGBTQ employees to come out. There are exceptions everywhere, of course, and it’s critical we continue to push for inclusion and diversity. Discrimination and hatred still exist, but more and more individuals understand the importance of simply accepting other people as they are—accepting their whole selves. At the same time, they understand the tremendous upside to diversity in terms of making our communities and workplaces stronger and more resilient. —Interviewed by Jeff GreenFashion is an industry in which gay people are very visible. My sexuality is just one facet of who I am, and while I was comfortable being very honest about it, I never felt that I needed to be a cheerleader. When I took over the business side in 2014 [after previously being just creative director], I was surprised to find out I was the first openly gay CEO of a major company in Britain. I started coming into contact with more people from outside the fashion industry—like investors and fund managers. I remember one of the first times a big bank came in for meeting—some of these guys were being very macho. From their questions I quickly realized that these people had really misunderstood what kind of person I was, and what a creative person is.Fashion can be a very accepting industry. As I get older, I realize how fortunate I was. There’s been so much progress, but I can’t imagine how much harder it still can be in some other industries that aren’t so much based in the city centers. It can take a tremendous amount of inner strength.When you’re starting out at work, it can feel like quite a gulp to correct someone—to say, actually I have a boyfriend. If you’re in a position of privilege and power, it’s so important that you encourage a good and tolerant culture. That’s the really hard work—building a good culture—much more so than the day-to-day operations. We do still need to talk about diversity and acceptance.When I was designing my last show for Burberry last year, I felt like the culture was heading into a period where you had some real extremes. I was looking at what was happening, not just with sexuality but with gender as well, and with the beginnings of the #MeToo movement. Before leaving this traditional British company that’s been around for 160 years, I felt it was important to take the chance to say in a strong way that tradition and diversity and acceptance really can live together—and they have to. —Interviewed by Robert WilliamsI wish I could have known just how welcoming and inclusive our workplaces would be one day. At the start of my career, I never hid who I was—but I wasn’t particularly open about it, either. Growing up as a gay man in Dublin, I never imagined I’d be the CEO of a globally recognized brand that would actively campaign to legalize same-sex marriage, and I never imagined the incredible amount of support we’d receive from our staff and our shareholders and our customers.When I started in the airline industry, working for Aer Lingus in Dublin, homosexuality was still illegal in Ireland. The airline didn’t fly on Christmas Day, and bishops would bless new aircraft entering service. This wasn’t the 1960s; it was the 1990s. Progress on social issues has been hard-won, but it happened relatively quickly once it started. I’ve seen the damage it can do when people don’t feel that they can bring their whole self to work, and I’ve seen the benefit of diverse backgrounds around the management table.Get involved with your business’s LGBTQ network. I’m a member of our LGBTQ network at Qantas, Illuminate. I attended the last Illuminate conference and sat in the audience, not on the stage, because I wanted to listen and learn from what others have experienced. It’s vital for us to get together and discuss what we’re doing well, and what we can do to help more people feel that they can be open about their identity. —Interviewed by Angus WhitleyI wish I would have known the power of my different experience, than the majority of the population. In the beginning of my career it was a different time than it is now, and I may have had some of my own concerns about acceptance. I view it all so very differently now, and I find it encouraging for the next generation of leaders that it is a different landscape—not for everyone, but for many.I see it now as such an important part of the work that I do, because I know what it feels like to be “other-ized” in the world. Especially with the work that we do in developing toys that are diverse and inclusive, I draw on that experience of feeling different and use it to build even greater empathy for communities that I am not a part of. It’s an important part of the work that I do. It’s also important in team building, not just in the product that I make. I feel very committed to making diverse teams and making sure that people’s voices are heard. And that we just don’t build a diverse team, but that we make a safe space for everyone to bring their whole authentic selves to our creation process.Even from the beginning of an interview process, ask about culture. To know who you are and know that you deserve to offer every unique and amazing talent that you have to an organization that appreciates you and values you for the whole person that you are.Stated policy is really critical, but most interview processes today are panel interviews and really taking a look at the type of people who are in leadership and their comfort level within their workspace. If you go into a interview process and you are faced with a very homogenized panel of folks, that may give you a little bit of pause. Or you can flip it and say, perhaps if they do have policies in place that are welcoming, they could bring an individual from the LGBTQ community who could bring a perspective that’s needed within that organization.Queer voices are louder within the landscape of media. It’s progress, not perfection. Societal acceptance is a big part of it. What I will say about my own personal experience is that from the moment I walked into Mattel, our design team was a beautiful rainbow of diversity of ethnicity and gender and sexual orientation. I recognize that I have been very lucky in the place that I landed, as far as from the very beginning feeling very welcomed and having a community of diverse people. But like any organization, the higher you go, the less diverse the space becomes, because there are fewer seats at the table. I personally feel an enormous sense of responsibility to take that empathy and the fight I got from growing up different from the majority of the population in the world and draw on that to make sure that every space I’m in, I’m bringing the voice of perhaps the marginalized or forgotten community into that room of influence and power. —Interviewed by Matthew TownsendWhen I entered into a real professional role, to be quite honest it wasn’t heavily discussed, especially in the workforce. It was one of the things that was understood because of discrimination issues and things like that happening. The company I was with prior to the Gap, things with the LGBTQ community were somewhat of an unmentionable. It’s not something that you would talk about. It was because of the social stigmas that happened and the fact that it could be offensive to a large population of people at the same time, although it wasn’t discriminatory or anything like that. It just wasn’t something that was often talked about. It’s very different than it is here at Gap Inc. as we progressed in the last 10 or 15 years.I came out very late in life. I came out at 35, and I was married and I had two children, so it was even more of a stigma to do what I had done. It was a very difficult thing for me to do. It made it even harder for me at the time to talk about, given where I was in my life.As I came out and I realized that this burden that I carried for such a long part of my life was being lifted off my back, I also realized that I became a much better leader and better person and it just changed everything, quite honestly. And that’s when I had the courage to talk about it when it wasn’t being talked about.As I was going through this major life change, I had a lot of people who had been a part of my life for a very long time. Some of them were leaders that I reported to, some of them were peers that I worked with, and there were people who worked for me at the same time. I remember the first conversation that I had with somebody that I had worked for and confiding in her and letting her know the transition I was going [through], and her openness and her support was unbelievably meaningful. It really was one of those things that allowed me to not only get through it because of my sexuality and the changes I was making, but because she was such an important leader in the organization and she was so supportive of me. It was a really important part of my professional development at the same time.This was the year 2000 when I came out. I came out because I had met another man, and he was also married, and when I made that decision to be who I was and love the person, the conversations I had to have were not only about me just coming out, but honestly I had to explain to people what took me so long and why it had been so hard. For many people at my age, it was perceived as a bit odd that I would wait so long to come out.In a professional setting, especially when you’re a senior leader in a company, you end up spending more time with people at work oftentimes than you spend with your own family. I realized at that point I had to be true to everyone, and I had to be true to certainly my family and the people that I loved. But I had to be true to myself, and that meant also having those honest conversations with the people that I worked with.I’m the senior vice president of strategic alliances and global franchise. For me there’s two things: I’m responsible for a large percentage of our international business. I travel to places all around the world and I get to see firsthand the inequality out there in terms of how people are treated. You have the extremes: In some areas of the world it’s just a violation of the law, and in other places it’s embraced. I’ve had the opportunity to see the world, and at the same time, I’m the executive sponsor of GEAR, which is our internal gay alliance at the organization that supports our gay and LGBTQ community here at Gap. It’s given me an opportunity in my mind to have an impact on both the people that I work with and then upholding the values of our company when I’m working around the world because Gap is a company that very much believes in equality for all. I feel like I’m obligated to reflect that. —Interviewed by Jordyn HolmanWhen I started work, being LGBT was not spoken about so much. We didn’t have the same equality legislation we have today. The World Health Organization, the year I started with Barclays, had only just in that year passed a motion to say that being LGBT was not a mental health disorder. And since that time we’ve come on an extraordinary journey, certainly in the U.K. in terms of changes in law, creating the same basic rights for people who identify as LGBT as those who are hetero. The working environment has changed as well, and the understanding of what it means to be LGBT, and therefore changes, I guess, in the firm have altered as the fabric of society has altered.In 2011 I popped along to a Spectrum event. It was an event hosted by Amy Stanning, talking about her personal journey and the fact that the bank had supported her in changing genders and helping her coming out to her colleagues in a very safe, very reassuring, very affirmative way. In hearing Amy’s story, that was very transformational for me. It made me realize it was a company I wanted to work for. It was a call for me to be more proactive.Is it better in financial services? Yes. That’s because financial services in general invested a lot of time and effort in things like unconscious bias training, in getting people to talk about diversity and inclusion and the importance of having a diverse and inclusive workplace. It’s important on many levels to attract and retain talent. We’re all fighting for the top talent. If you’re not a diverse and inclusive firm, you’re restricting access to that top talent. It’s a great way of retaining positive, loyal, motivated colleagues. I’m extremely loyal as a consequence of the opportunities I’ve had and the support I’ve had as a visible and senior out lesbian. —Interviewed by Will MathisAll I got about Accenture in those days was a 10-page brochure from a campus recruiter, and that was pretty much all I knew going into the interviews. There was nothing about diversity or anything like that in the brochure. Then I had two interviews, where of course maybe I was too shy to ask. Today you can go on the website of Accenture and you’ll find an LGBT network, and you type in “diversity” or “belonging” and you’ll find an explanation of how Accenture looks at those topics, and you’ll see people marching in pride marches in pictures and meeting in a network. You’ll see people like yourself. Whereas in the brochure there were pretty much white males with white shirts and red ties.I joined Accenture on Oct. 15, and someone said, “on Nov. 11 we have the office party, are you coming?” I had to decide if I was going to bring my partner at the time to come to the party and effectively come out in front of everyone, which I then did, and it worked out fine for me. That’s the kind of steps that people have to take when they are gay and when they are in corporate life. You take a risk because you don’t know what the response will be.I would say be out and network. Be out and then, when you grow your confidence, help progress the networks and help progress the LGBT agenda in your company. Be out, be visible, network with other peers and people and leaders in your company, and then once you gain more confidence, help progress the agenda for and with the company and eventually with its clients.I always say to people at Accenture, “You don’t have to sit everybody down and say, ‘Listen, I want to tell you something.’ ” People figure it out. If you’re by the water cooler and you say what you’ve been doing over the weekend with your wife, husband, or whatever, they will figure it out. It’s not like you have to make it a moment.Be out and be natural about it, because ultimately people will figure it out and it’s OK. It’s nothing to be ashamed of. It doesn’t have to be presented as big news.When I moved to the U.S. [in 2010] and I saw what was going on here, I said to myself, I need to be more out there, I need to be a more visible role model, I need to be a more visible leader. So I’ve done quite a few activities at Accenture, but also externally with the World Economic Forum, and I’m on the board of Out & Equal, because role models matter. I always say everybody is a role model. The young professional that is out is also a role model, so being visible and a role model matters. That shows the way for others. —Interviewed by Jordyn HolmanTech has traditionally been dominated by men. Tech cannot fall in the same pattern as finance and other male-dominated industries. We really have the opportunity to bring diversity as a strength. Tech leaders have to take on that responsibility. Tech leaders have to feel responsible that when you do an interview process, you expand your circle of interviewees to represent society as it is. We must actively create seats at the table for diverse viewpoints, knowing that difference is a teacher. The solutions for the future come out of diverse perspectives.Since Lightspeed’s inception, we’ve fostered an environment of inclusion and diversity. In fact, the original members of the Lightspeed team were all from the LGBTQ community. I strongly believe this core group set the foundation for Lightspeed’s corporate culture that brings together and celebrates different viewpoints and voices.In Amsterdam, the annual pride parade takes place on the famous canals, and each company or institution has a boat. We’re excited to be part of the festivities this year. Our boat will fit 100 people, and we’ll use the messaging as a platform to showcase diversity and inclusion within our corporate culture. We’ll also be walking in the pride parade in Montreal (where our headquarters are located) for the second year in a row.After seven years of bootstrapping the company, we started to attract investors. This was the first time where we wondered if our identify would cost us our big chance. But it quickly became clear that our authenticity was a key ingredient in our unique culture. —Interviewed by Sandrine RastelloIf I had realized that it was safe to be out, I would have done things completely differently. Especially when I moved to the U.S. with my company and I moved to a state where they didn’t acknowledge same-sex relationships. So my partner went in secret with me. I think it would have made a huge difference to me if I felt it was safe to be out and that my company would have fully supported me and my partner in our move there together. That made it very difficult.It was during a job interview with the CEO of Zurich [Insurance Group] when I decided to come out, and it was partly because of the way that no fuss was made about it. I was just accepted and it became, “Well yes, that’s fine.” They said you must bring her along to any functions we have where partners are invited, and that was very comforting to me. And then I just thought why did I stay quiet about it for so long, when actually people are very, very accepting.I would say be yourself; bring your whole self to work. Please don’t go back into the closet—because you will be the one who fundamentally suffers for it. And if you’re out at work, you and your business will benefit.I definitely, definitely regret not coming out earlier. I look back on it with horror, really, on how I behaved, particularly towards my partner at the time. Keeping our relationship all a secret. I remember moving to Kansas City, and my work colleagues all thought I had moved there on my own. I was invited to a party when we first got there, and I left my girlfriend of the time at home on her own. I look back at that, and it was just such an awful thing to do. But that was how I felt I had to be.My take is that men seem to do the networking much better, therefore they have a better support system. And I think therefore a lot of the women tend to be more in the closet, because naturally we’re not so out and so good at this networking and support system. I think that’s one of the differences. So we have now started a professional lesbian and bisexual women’s network in the U.K. It’s very, very new, and it seems amazing that it would have taken so long to form that. I just think it’s because lesbians and bisexual women haven’t been operating as well as men do in their networks. So you don’t have that support mechanism. Men do tend to be more overt about it, maybe, whereas women still wouldn’t often mention it. We tend to just be a bit quieter about it, not talk about it in the same way. —Interviewed by Gavin FinchI learned early on that it’s important to bring your whole self to work. When I came out publicly in the workplace, I was able not to have to worry about hiding part of me. I could stand up, be my whole self, and not focus on worrying about would somebody find out. You can make a difference by simply being out and by making it clear that you can bring things to the table regardless of who you are.At a lot of companies it’s sort of a side topic [but] at Starbucks, inclusion and diversity are at the heart of what we’re all about. The heritage of supporting LGBTQ is long-standing. It’s one of the reasons why I joined the company [after 15 years at Walt Disney]. Starbucks supports inclusion and diversity because it’s the right thing to do, but there’s also a business benefit: You tend to attract the very best people to the company when inclusion is not an issue. —Interviewed by Leslie PattonAs a young graduate embarking on job searching, I wish I had the understanding of the importance of diversity and access to LGBTI-friendly rankings across the whole spectrum of industries. Of course when we enter the workplace at the bottom of the food chain, especially during a downturn in the economy with not much work experience, one may say we were lucky to find a job at all. But in fact, especially for young people, knowing that a potential employer is friendly to the community and stands for equality is an important motivator in making a person loyal and proud of the company she works for. And being able to bring our full selves to work takes away the pretense and fear.When I became a very visible lesbian in Hong Kong years ago, unlikely supporters came from all directions. Especially when one works in conservative industries such as property, I did not expect longtime suppliers and engineers to voice their support. And while I had assumed the older generation would probably take a more conservative stance, there were many older men in their 70s and 80s who have been kind enough to tell me they were proud of what I am. Today same-sex marriage is now recognized in 26 or 27 countries worldwide. In many regions where the LGBTI are still marginalized, discrimination to the point of being put to physical danger is a very real threat. Hence, if we are to stand for equality, it is important that in spaces of relative physical safety—if not perceived social risk—we must strive to keep pushing the envelope of acceptance and pride.What advice would you give a young LGBT person entering the business world today?The traditionally prudent thing to do is to just keep our head down and stay closeted in fear of offending the tastes of more senior colleagues. That would be a mistake. This would offend the objectives of visibility and detract from the full experience of life. A better approach may be to find opportunities to let colleagues know one’s stand on LGBTIQ issues, and always seek to find allies to support. No matter how conservative a workplace, I’ve found that most people are willing to voice their support once someone else takes the first step. Do not be afraid to encounter people that have different opinions and worldviews, as this is precisely the basis of dialogue. It’s important for the community that we find as many opportunities as possible to engage in constructive conversations about LGBTIQ acceptance. —Interviewed by Bruce Einhorn'),\n",
       " ('Walmart’s Deal With Ellen DeGeneres Shows How Much America Has Changed',\n",
       "  '2019-06-20',\n",
       "  'Ellen DeGeneres is on television every weekday. Sometimes she’s on twice. Her daytime talk show, The Ellen DeGeneres Show, brings in more advertising revenue than Dr. Phil’s and Kelly Ripa’s combined, and her prime-time special, Ellen’s Game of Games, gets consistently good ratings. DeGeneres produces movies, voices a popular Pixar character, has her own digital content network, and has earned at least $500 million on endorsement and TV deals, according to a Bloomberg Billionaires Index analysis. She has her own lifestyle brand and last year formed a partnership with Walmart Inc. to create a clothing and accessories line that’s awash in American flags and rainbows and is sold in 2,300 Walmart stores. “I’m still gay, by the way. It’s really working out for me now,” DeGeneres said in her Netflix stand-up special last year.That the largest U.S. retailer finds value in aligning itself with a 61-year-old lesbian who has a recurring segment on her talk show called “Oh, Straight People,” is, in many ways, a testament to how thoroughly Americans have accepted LGBTQ rights. It’s been 50 years since the Stonewall uprising in New York marked the start of the modern gay rights movement. Almost two-thirds of Americans support same-sex marriage, Gallup polls show, the opposite of what they reported when DeGeneres first came out two decades ago. The chief executive of America’s first trillion-dollar company, Apple Inc., is gay, and yet iPhones still fly off the shelves. Walt Disney Co. this year had its first gay characters on both its youth cable channel and in its latest Avengers film. According to GLAAD, 8.8% of prime-time TV characters are gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer. Walmart even has a Pride shop online.Data: Kantar, Community Marketing Inc.Such mainstreaming of LGBTQ products, characters, and culture would have been almost unthinkable 22 years ago, when DeGeneres publicly came out as a lesbian. Back then, being gay almost killed her career.DeGeneres had spent the first few decades of her life pretending to be someone she wasn’t. Her stand-up rarely included jokes about dating or relationships, as if she were avoiding the issue. That changed in April 1997, when she came out in an interview with Time magazine, which put her on its cover along with the headline “Yep, I’m Gay.” That month 42 million people watched her character come out on her sitcom, Ellen. The episode—with Oprah Winfrey guest-starring as her therapist—was funny, well-received by critics, and enthusiastically celebrated by lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender fans. Advertisers felt differently.“Everybody warned me. My publicist, my manager, my agent. Everybody making money off me said, ‘Don’t do it,’\\u2009” DeGeneres said in her Netflix special. The blowback hit her fast and strong. Evangelical pastor Jerry Falwell called her “Ellen DeGenerate.” A bomb scare, which cleared the TV studio shortly after the episode’s taping, was the first of many threats against her. Advertisers soon backed out. “We don’t think it is a smart business decision to be advertising in an environment that is so polarized,” a spokeswoman for Chrysler told the New York Times, explaining the carmaker’s decision to pull commercials from the show.One Ellen episode was even slapped with a parental advisory warning after DeGeneres’s character shared a platonic kiss with a woman. Soon after, ABC canceled the show, and the job offers stopped coming.“If I’d been fully aware of all the consequences—that the public was going to hate me and the press was going to attack me, that I was going to lose a lot of people—maybe I wouldn’t have done it,” she told writer Eric Marcus in early 2001, when she was still struggling to get back on TV. “But I didn’t feel like I had a choice.”DeGeneres’s rare act of honesty couldn’t change the fact that the 1990s were a bleak time for the LGBTQ community. AIDS was killing thousands of people, primarily gay men. In 1996, President Bill Clinton signed the Defense of Marriage Act, banning federal recognition of same-sex marriages. Two years later, a gay student, Matthew Shepard, was tortured and killed in Laramie, Wyo. DeGeneres spoke at a vigil for Shepard held on the steps of the U.S. Capitol in October 1998. “This is what I was trying to stop,” she said, in tears. “This is exactly why I did what I did.”At the time, no company better represented the cultural climate DeGeneres was hoping to change than Walmart, the multibillion-dollar enterprise co-founded by Sam Walton, who taught Sunday school at his Presbyterian church and preached a Christianity-laced corporate gospel of service, respect, and sacrifice.“If you want to reach the Christian population on Sunday, you do it from the church pulpit,” Ralph Reed, the architect of the politically powerful Christian Coalition, once said. “But if you want to reach them on Saturday, do it at Walmart.”In the 1990s the company refused to sell albums that contained swear words; even John Mellencamp’s heartland rock was censored and sanitized for shoppers’ protection. Then in 2001 female Walmart employees accused the company of denying them promotions and equal pay in a litigation campaign that evolved into a class-action lawsuit. (In 2011 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the then 1.5 million-women-strong group couldn’t be considered a class; individual lawsuits have since been filed and are ongoing.) In sworn statements, women at Walmart said they endured comments such as “God made Adam first, so women would always be second to men.” A spokesman for Walmart says the allegations “are not representative of the positive experiences millions of women have had working at Walmart” and that it will defend itself against the claims.Walmart’s revenue and profit soared, but by the mid-2000s the company was grappling with withering criticism of its business and labor practices. It also wanted to break into urban markets such as New York City and Chicago, where social attitudes are more liberal. So, Walmart changed. In 2006 it plunged head-first into LGBTQ activism by joining the National Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Commerce (NGLCC), donating to gay-friendly charities, and hiring a consulting firm that specialized in marketing to gay consumers. Not all of the company’s 1.3 million employees liked the stance. Nor did Christian conservative groups, which called for a boycott over the Thanksgiving weekend. Its business threatened, Walmart quickly caved. In 2007 it dropped the NGLCC partnership and released a statement saying that it would “not make corporate contributions to support or oppose highly controversial issues unless they directly relate to our ability to serve our customers.”“I was mad. I was very mad,” NGLCC co-founder and President Justin Nelson recalls. “They have spent years correcting that mistake.”For the next few years Walmart shied away from anything related to gay rights. In 2013, for example, it declined to join Disney, Nike, and Starbucks in urging the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn the Defense of Marriage Act. A year later the company seemed to have a change of heart. It opposed a 2015 bill in its home state of Arkansas that would have allowed businesses to discriminate against gay customers on religious grounds. It earned, then lost, then won back a perfect score on the Human Rights Campaign’s Corporate Equality Index, a highly regarded measure of LGBTQ-friendly workplaces that companies often use as a recruiting tool.Earlier this year, a Walmart commercial featured two gay men shopping together. The American Family Association criticized the ad, saying Walton was “probably turning over in his grave.” Walmart, it noted, had almost always sided with Christian conservatives in the past. “At least with a company like Amazon, we knew they were liberal from the outset,” a statement on its website said. “But this seems more like a betrayal from a well-known friend.”DeGeneres’s comeback started in 2001 when she hosted the Emmy Awards, which had been postponed twice after the Sept. 11 attacks. Her characteristically upbeat and self-deprecating jokes brought much needed relief in somber times. “They can’t take away our creativity, our striving for excellence, our joy,” she said. “Only network executives can do that.” The audience gave her a standing ovation.With that, DeGeneres was back in Hollywood’s good graces. A second attempt at a sitcom was short-lived, but then came a best-selling book and voice-over work as Dory in Pixar’s animated hit Finding Nemo. Still, her sexuality was considered controversial. When her talk show debuted in 2003, DeGeneres remembers a station manager saying, “No one is going to watch a lesbian during the day.”That prediction was quickly proved wrong—the show won the Daytime Emmy for outstanding talk show four years in a row—and DeGeneres soon became a coveted corporate sponsor. American Express Co. hired her first, in 2004. Then came a J.C. Penney Co. deal that prompted the threat of a boycott from a group called One Million Moms, which objected to the retailer’s use of a homosexual spokeswoman. (J.C. Penney stuck by DeGeneres.) Today DeGeneres has a lifestyle brand, ED by Ellen, that was born out of the work she and her wife, actress Portia de Rossi, do of buying, renovating, and selling Los Angeles mansions to buyers such as former Google CEO Eric Schmidt. What started as a home decor line has expanded into clothing, accessories, and pet products. Macy’s, Nordstrom, PetSmart, and Bed, Bath & Beyond carry the line, which has an annual revenue in the nine figures.“Her power of influence makes her truly extraordinary,” says Matt Fleming, director for celebrity acquisition at the Marketing Arm. According to surveys conducted by the agency, DeGeneres is as well-known and liked as Paul McCartney.With an average of 2.9 million viewers per day according to Nielsen, her daytime TV show pulls a surprisingly diverse audience. It’s 74% female, consumer insights firm MRI-Simmons estimates, but otherwise mostly matches the general population in age, race, and education.“Ellen is the Oprah of our era, in the sense of how much she dominates the category,” says Dan Wilch, a consultant at Magid Associates, which conducts an annual study of daytime TV. Phil McGraw’s show, Dr. Phil, may get better ratings, but according to Kantar data, DeGeneres’s show pulled in more than twice as much ad revenue.Walmart’s partnership with DeGeneres gives the retailer a widely popular ally in its battle against Amazon. It carries both ED by Ellen and EV1, DeGeneres’s clothing brand, which comes in a wide range of sizes and looks like a cheaper version (everything is $30 or under) of the kind of pants-and-jean-jacket outfits DeGeneres wears. Walmart declined to provide sales figures for EV1 but says it’s “pleased” with the line. “Ellen is Ellen,” says Janey Whiteside, Walmart’s chief customer officer. “She appeals to all ages. She’s great.”DeGeneres’s clean-cut, friendly image—she ends her show by reminding viewers to “be kind to one another”—is reassuring for brands in this perilous marketing era when any misstep could result in a massive social media backlash. As Jeff Greenfield, co-founder of advertising analytics firm C3 Metrics, puts it, “Ellen is safe.” She loves animals. She dances. She often has her wife on as a guest. The couple have been married for more than a decade. “Even when we talk with very conservative brands, they don’t shy away,” says Stacy Jones, CEO of the product placement firm Hollywood Branded. “She is a family brand.”The American Family Association today seems uncharacteristically mum about DeGeneres. While it released that scathing rebuke of Walmart for its gay-friendly commercial, it didn’t respond to a request for comment on the chain’s partnership with the comedian.In the Netflix special, DeGeneres joked about how everybody is now fine with her being a lesbian. Instead, her most alienating characteristic is that she’s rich. “Do you think you’re still relatable?” she said a friend recently asked her. “Of course I’m relatable,” DeGeneres replied, then followed her butler into the solarium for breakfast.Later, the butler drew her a bath but left her towel out of reach. “So I had to do that bath mat scoot all the way across the bathroom to get the towel,” she said, acting it out on stage. “And then I stopped and thought, Oh my God, this is relatable! People do the bath mat scoot when the butler forgets to put the towel next to the tub!” —With Tom Metcalf'),\n",

       "  '2019-06-19',\n",
       "  'With a show like Pose, the film and television industry makes a real play to bolster trans and other queer artists. But the LGBTQ community remains vastly underrepresented.Steven Canals has been deep in preparation for his first time directing an episode of prime-time television. The Bronx, N.Y., native is working on the second season of Pose, a show he writes and co-created that has critics generally elated. The opportunity to now direct, he says, “is incredible.”The FX Networks show has the largest number of trans actors in series regular roles in TV history. It’s an urban fantasia, a soap wherein larger-than-life glamazons fight battles on the dance floor, pantomiming to themes like “executive realness” and “royalty.” Fans took to social media during the Season 2 premiere to share GIFs of characters such as Angel Evangelista, a Puerto Rican sex worker played by trans actor Indya Moore, and quips from sharp-tongued emcee Pray Tell (Billy Porter). The stars have drawn attention everywhere—magazine covers, fashion campaigns, red carpets—and the show was just picked up for a third season.The Golden Globe-nominated drama mixes ethereal costumes with the gritty reality of poverty and the AIDS epidemic in 1980s New York. Set against a backdrop of Trump-style wealth and leaning heavily for inspiration on the documentary Paris Is Burning, it captures the life of black and Latinx trans and other queer outcasts who built maternal “houses” that took in LGBTQ youth. In its second season, the story moves to 1990, when Madonna’s Vogue thrust the dance scene into the mainstream.Canals, an openly gay Afro-Latinx screenwriter who wrote the pilot in 2014, spent years being told it was too niche and not commercial enough, before being discovered by Ryan Murphy, the co-creator of Glee and American Horror Story, in 2016.“The reality is that we still aren’t seeing a lot of trans narratives being told,” Canals says. He notes there’s been progress in inclusion for LGBTQ people as a whole in Hollywood, and gay men and women in particular, but “we’re not doing great when it comes to representation of folks who are bisexual, and certainly I don’t think we’re doing great when it comes to trans representation either.”Out of the 4,403 roles in the 100 top-grossing U.S. movies of 2017Note: There were no transgender characters.Data: USC AnnenbergThe numbers back him up. A 2018 study by the University of Southern California’s Annenberg Inclusion Initiative found transgender people largely absent from Hollywood films and that only 1% of all characters in 1,100 popular films from 2007 to 2017 were from the LGBTQ community. There wasn’t one trans character across the top 100 movies of 2017. TV is more inclusive, with the percentage of LGBTQ series regulars on broadcast prime-time scripted programming reaching an all-time high of 8.8% in 2018, says GLAAD, the LGBTQ media advocacy group. The producers behind Transparent and Vida have sought out LGBTQ writers and actors.“You have a show like Pose out in the world that is well received and has found an audience, and so suddenly everyone thinks, ‘Well, trans people are doing great.’ But that’s only one show,” Canals says. “Last year we had a little over 500 original pieces of scripted content. I think we could do better.”Over the past year, Hollywood’s biggest studios have been championing the lives of gay rock icons Freddie Mercury and Elton John, though the former film, Bohemian Rhapsody, received criticism for downplaying Mercury’s sexuality. Rocketman, the John biopic from Paramount Pictures, featured the first gay sex scene in a movie by a major studio in recent years. (Scenes were cut for distribution in Russia, where homosexuality is illegal.)Walt Disney’s Marvel Entertainment, one of the most powerful forces in modern Hollywood, is working on new and existing LGBTQ superhero characters; the first trans superhero has already made her debut on TV, in the CW’s Supergirl earlier this year. A gay-headlined major studio romantic comedy is in the works starring comedian Billy Eichner, produced by Judd Apatow for Universal Pictures. The subject is radical in its simplicity: It’s about two people who have commitment issues in their relationship, and the people are men.Netflix is set to adapt the play The Boys in the Band, with Pose’s Murphy as one of the producers, reuniting the all-gay Broadway cast. Still, some of the most celebrated recent movies about LGBTQ people, like Call Me by Your Name and Love, Simon, starred straight lead actors.“We’ve come a very long way from the days of old Hollywood, where every movie star was forced to be in the closet and there was no such thing as same sexuality for public consumption in narrative storytelling,” says Matt Tyrnauer, director of the documentary Scotty and the Secret History of Hollywood. But “Hollywood is lagging in its full embrace of open same sexuality as something that is as mainstream as society itself.”Actors like Ellen Page have been vocal about the pressure not to come out for fear of the impact on their careers.“As more people feel comfortable coming out professionally, we will get more calls from people who believe that has negatively impacted their career,” says Adam Moore, national director of equal opportunity and diversity at SAG-AFTRA. The actors union tries to push the message “It’s not what you are, it’s what you can play as a performer,” but once LGBTQ people come out, some find their work limited to playing only those roles, Moore says.One standout example of progress is the moment that actor Andrew Scott is having. The openly gay Irishman has become one of TV’s hottest sex symbols in the role of a straight priest in a love affair with the female lead in the show Fleabag. The onscreen chemistry is so sizzling, he has become known as “the hot priest” to legions of fans.Chuck James, a founding partner at talent agency ICM Partners, says that in recent months he’s seen an increase in requests for actors to fill LGBTQ roles in mainstream dramas and for more actors who are LGBTQ themselves. For the stars of Pose, Canals wants recognition of their work as actors, without qualification. “These trans women are not playing trans, they are playing a woman who happens to be trans,” he says. “There is so much more that makes these characters who they are.”'),\n",

       "  'The mainstream business lobby is helping train its members how to address LGBTQ issues.ILLUSTRATION: BRÁULIO AMADO FOR BLOOMBERG BUSINESSWEEKThe venerable U.S. Chamber of Commerce—the biggest U.S. lobbying organization and the voice of business on Capitol Hill—is coming out. After decades of silence on issues of sexual orientation and gender identity, it’s become a staunch supporter of the proposed federal Equality Act, which makes explicit civil rights protections for LGBT citizens.The chamber’s new position isn’t brave, exactly. The group’s stance echoes the one its members have almost uniformly endorsed. With Congress deadlocked on LGBT issues and some mostly Southern states pushing laws that would erode court wins for gay rights, Amazon.com, Apple, and Walt Disney and other big companies have been leading voices calling for equality. “We’re a member-driven organization,” says Neil Bradley, the chamber’s chief policy officer. “Based on our discussion with our members and our mandate for what we’re to be for, we think the policy matches up with that.”The chamber had declined plenty of previous opportunities to stake out a position on LGBT workplace rights, says Bradley, pointing to the group’s neutral stance on the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, also known as ENDA, which was proposed unsuccessfully 11 times from 1994 through 2013 and would have extended civil rights protections to LGBT employees. A majority of Americans still live in states where it’s legal to fire someone, or deny them housing, if they are LGBT. “It’s fair to say that in that intervening decade, for employers across the country, this has become more of an issue that they’re dealing with, and one in which they have a firmer, more certain position,” Bradley says.To some degree, the chamber is also playing catch-up with its own state chapters. Even in Ohio, home to a number of so-called religious freedom laws that allow people to refuse some actions that go against their beliefs, the state chamber has endorsed statewide civil rights protections for gay and transgender residents, says Alana Jochum, executive director of Equality Ohio. “This has been building for a while,” says Jochum. And while the chamber’s new position may be familiar to some, “it may be game changing to help others to realize this really is an economic issue.”This spring the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation sponsored workshops in Virginia, Ohio, and Florida to make the business case for LGBT inclusion in the workplace. The idea built on a successful partnership with Lady Gaga’s Born This Way Foundation around “kindness” in the office, says Marc DeCourcey, who leads the foundation’s Corporate Citizenship Center.In all, more than 500 people attended the workshops, including representatives of Disney, PNC Financial Services Group, and United Airlines. One attendee, Dave Bornmann, chief marketing officer of software company Naylor Association Solutions, says he never expected his road map to LGBT inclusion would come from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. “There’s a part of me that’s a little embarrassed that I hadn’t thought about it sooner,” says Bornmann. He says he feels perfectly comfortable as an out executive at Naylor, but support might be less evident for others at the 500-employee company or for potential job candidates. Naylor doesn’t yet have an LGBT employee group, and its website, which he oversees, doesn’t explicitly talk about LGBT initiatives. Bornmann says he plans to make changes to address the shortcoming he’s found.As for the chamber, better late than never, says Bob Witeck, a consultant who’s worked with companies for 25 years, helping them adopt LGBT-friendly policies. Both the Supreme Court and Congress are grappling with the status of civil rights for gay Americans, so having the business lobby take a position may help shift some support, he points out. “We would have welcomed them [the Chamber] 10 years ago, with a lot more enthusiasm,” says Witeck, who attended the chamber’s workshop in Virginia. “But we’re grateful they’re here now.”'),\n",

       "  'Roberts (front) and the Philadelphia Fusion at the team’s house in Los Angeles.Under his father, Brian, Tucker Roberts is fielding teams of professional Overwatch players and investing in the future of gaming.When the Philadelphia Fusion plays, the team president, Tucker Roberts, likes to stay in the dugout, alongside the coaches and bench players. He hangs out there as long as the team is winning. But if things start to go poorly, he heads onto the arena floor to pace among the fans banging on inflatable thunder sticks. If that doesn’t help, and a loss feels imminent, Roberts parks himself in a backroom, next to the Fusion’s social media editors, who are crafting online videos for supporters at home.“It’s basic feng shui,” Roberts says. “If your environment isn’t working for you, you have to change it.”The mix of restlessness, bile, and foreboding he feels would be familiar to the owners of pro football and basketball teams. But despite his family’s great wealth—Roberts’s father is chairman and chief executive officer of Comcast Corp., the cable giant that owns NBCUniversal and the NHL’s Philadelphia Flyers, among other businesses—his angst isn’t tied up with the fortunes of a major sports team. Fusion players compete in Overwatch, a frenetic video game, an e-sport, in which squads of professionals (six per side) launch grenades and blast cannons at one another, counting kills and respawning as needed. During games, players wear short-sleeve jerseys—orange-on-black for home games, orange-on-white for away—with their nicknames on the back. If bowling shirts still exist in the 22nd century, they will look like these.The Fusion’s roster is stacked with talent from Europe and e-sports powerhouse South Korea. Despite missing the preseason last year because several players had visa problems, the team almost won the championship, losing in the finals to the London Spitfire. “We came in with expectations that were, like, Let’s just get some wins, let’s not try to make the playoffs,” Roberts says. “And then once we got there, it was like we were playing with house money.” During the offseason, he beefed up the team’s coaching staff, in the hopes of making another playoff run.Comcast’s decision, two years ago, to pay a $20 million franchise fee through its Comcast Spectacor division to start the Fusion was the first of several big e-sports bets in which Roberts played a role. In February he and Park Jung-Ho, CEO of South Korean mobile phone giant SK Telecom Co., announced they were forming a venture to field teams that will play Fortnite, an Overwatch competitor, among other titles. Then in March, Comcast revealed plans to build a $50 million arena for the Fusion in South Philadelphia. With a planned capacity of 3,500 fans, it will serve as a sort of sister arena to the 20,000-seat Wells Fargo Center that Comcast already owns, which will host this year’s Overwatch championship. Architectural renderings suggest the interior will feature many screens.Roberts, who’s tall, thin, and athletic, also recently began dating Olivia Munn, an actress who has a cult following among gamers from her days as a host on the now-defunct video game TV network G4. Roberts won’t talk about the relationship except to say that he admires Munn’s business acumen. “She invested early in Uber and Wag,” a dog-walking app, he says.Data: NewzooThe idea of building a long-term enterprise around people watching other people play video games is no sure thing, but Comcast isn’t alone in its enthusiasm. The prize money in e-sports can reach into the millions of dollars, and researcher Newzoo BV expects overall revenue to climb 27% this year, to $1.1 billion, thanks to increased ticket sales, corporate sponsorships, and media rights deals. (Comcast is currently considering offers for naming rights for Fusion Arena.) Among the new owners of video game teams: basketball great Michael Jordan, Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, and Atlanta’s Cox Communications.Data: NewzooRoberts, who’s 29, sees the Fusion as part of a larger strategy to win over young people. E-sports could be to Generation Z what music videos were to Generation X, and Comcast, if all goes well, will be the MTV of this era.When Roberts was growing up in Philadelphia’s Chestnut Hill neighborhood, his dad’s company, then a regional cable carrier, was almost universally recognized, if not exactly beloved. “Having a nightmare Comcast story is practically a residency requirement in this town,” Philadelphia magazine once wrote. Neighborhood service centers were seen as crucibles of human frustration where impassive representatives faced customer meltdowns from behind barriers of bulletproof glass.It may not be surprising then that Tucker—whose full name is Brian Leon Tucker Roberts Jr.—immersed himself in galaxies far, far away. He read Harry Potter novels and played games. Brian Sr. took the 8-year-old Tucker to the King of Prussia mall for a Pokémon tournament, where he advanced five rounds before coming up against a 28-year-old rival who, as Tucker remembers it, was then getting a doctorate at the University of Pennsylvania. Tucker cried when he lost.In middle school, Roberts became obsessed with an online game called Star Wars Galaxies. He played as Kiey Ekips, a Zabrak bounty hunter, on the Scylla server and eventually joined a guild. Over time he helped build cities on Tatooine and Naboo, a planet in the Chommell sector. Along the way, he made some friends. “I’m hanging out with a bunch of 30-year-olds who are some German dudes, and they don’t know I’m 13, and they’re just treating me like another person,” Roberts says. On the internet, nobody knows if you’re the heir to an omnivorous cable empire.Escaping the family shadow was a little harder in college. Like his father and grandfather, Roberts attended the University of Pennsylvania, where he studied business. On campus at the time, school officials were just completing construction of the Roberts Proton Therapy Center, a 75,000-square-foot cancer-treatment facility, supported by his family’s philanthropy.Roberts got an early peek at the future of e-sports during an internship at Activision Blizzard Inc. After college, in 2013, he took a job at game maker Electronic Arts Inc., where he helped put The Sims game on the Apple Watch. His corporate Rum\\xadspringa complete, Roberts joined his dad in 2016, taking a job at Comcast’s venture capital arm in San Francisco. E-sports teams had recently become a hot investment, and Activision CEO Bobby Kotick decided to create a professional league built around Overwatch, the company’s 2016 shooting game, in which a well-armed cast of gifted and talented bioluminescent characters (a freedom-fighting DJ, a transcendentally empowered monk) duel for pyrotechnic dominance over a future version of Earth that’s been ravaged by insubordinate robots.The league struck a TV deal with Walt Disney Co. to air games on ABC and ESPN, and it arranged for the new owners, Comcast among them, to share revenue. Players would be guaranteed health care and a $50,000 minimum salary. (Most players earn a lot more; six-figure salaries are common.) Like the other 19 teams now in the league, including squads representing Shanghai and Paris, the Fusion would be based in Los Angeles for the first two seasons, playing all their games at the Blizzard Arena, a retrofitted studio in Burbank where The Tonight Show once taped. In 2020 the teams will relocate to their respective home cities.To prepare for the move, Roberts has been trying to endear the Fusion to Philly sports fans, or at the very least let fans know the team exists. Last season, Comcast produced a promotional video in which players wore dog masks, in the disquieting tradition of Philadelphia Eagles fans, and spray-painted the word “Fusion” on a wall. The nod to vandalism aside, Fusion supporters are abnormally well-behaved, at least by the standards of their hometown. Nobody has thrown batteries at opponents, or intentionally vomited on any off-duty police officers, or assaulted a mascot—exploits that have been credited to Eagles and Phillies fans. Unlike the old Veterans Stadium, Fusion Arena will not come equipped with an in-house jail.What it will have, it seems, is Gritty—the orange-fuzzed, googly-eyed, and exhaustively memed mascot of the Comcast-owned Flyers. At the Overwatch season opener on Valentine’s Day, fans went wild when Gritty showed up to lead a conga line of Fusion video game athletes into the arena. Gabrielle Egan, a 20-year-old student from Philadelphia, who’d flown to Los Angeles with a friend to attend the event, was in the spirit. “It’s the come-from-behind Philly toughness,” she said. For those fans unable to make cross-country trips, Comcast has organized meetups at local bars and restaurants that televise the contests.Comcast has also invested in N3rd Street Gamers LLC, which runs amateur tournaments in cities across the U.S. It’s part of a strategy to educate parents about the sport, according to Roberts. “I think a lot of parents never played games, never were a gamer,” he says. “So there’s been a shift of, like, ‘Oh my God, Grand Theft Auto is the devil. Video games are rotting your brain,’ right? And now the conversation has gone, ‘I don’t understand Minecraft, but I’m curious.’\\u200a”The Fusion’s current front office is located 25 miles from Blizzard Arena, in a beachside bungalow in Venice, Calif., whose previous tenant was Snapchat. It’s a cozy place with a well-cultivated sense of geek-chic whimsy. Roberts encourages the staff to wear slippers at work, a tradition he borrowed from South Korea, where e-sports are huge. He’s partial to a furry, Wookiee-like pair.In the living room, Roberts shows a visitor a 3D-printed statue of himself shaking hands with Faker—the nom de game of Lee Sang-hyeok, a 23-year-old South Korean considered among the best League of Legends players in the world. The statue was a present from SK Telecom’s Park, after his company formed the partnership with Comcast. In exchange, Roberts gave Park a varsity jacket with the logo of T1 Entertainment and Sports, their new venture. “He outgifted me,” Roberts says with a smile.Fusion athletes live across town in an Ikea-furnished eight-bedroom Tudor with a pool, a hot tub, and a treehouse. On a Monday evening in March, Roberts plops down on a sofa and joins a group of players watching Fusion University, the franchise’s minor league team, play on a widescreen TV. “Dude, we’re stomping it,” he says.Roberts’s dudely demeanor goes over well with players including Neptuno (aka Alberto Gonzalez Molinillo). “At the beginning, I didn’t even know much about Comcast,” says Neptuno, who’s from Spain and at 27 is one of the oldest members of the Fusion. “I didn’t know who Tucker was. I thought he was just another member of the staff, and I really liked him. Someone told me, ‘No, that’s your boss.’\\u200a”The team lives with all the panache of a high school robotics squad; two Fusion athletes, in fact, share a bedroom. The players rise at about 11 a.m., or “gamer morning,” as they call it. Lunch is at noon, the first of two daily meals prepared by the team’s chef, Heidi Marsh, a Minnesotan whose repertoire includes Cuban sandwiches and pasta with clams. “Italian goes over really well with these guys,” she says. Lately, Roberts has been trying to get the team to eat Philadelphia cheesesteaks. The Europeans are ambivalent.The players spend the rest of their day online scrimmaging against other Overwatch teams. They also study film, sitting with coaches and reviewing recordings of prior matches. The house has a gym, but gross motor exercise is optional.As in pro baseball, skipping college and heading straight to the pros is the norm in e-sports—though with the recent proliferation of collegiate teams, some highly touted recruits are now choosing to spend a couple of years on a university campus perfecting their finger work against fellow student gamers. Elk (Elijah Gallagher, 19), the only American player on the Fusion, says his parents were disappointed when he chose to forgo a higher education. He’s saving his salary to put toward college should his e-sports career peter out.*Division leaderData: Overwatch LeagueInjuries are more common than a nongamer might imagine. Neptuno began the season with bandages on his arm and is suffering from tendinitis and neck pain. Players use disposable hand-warming pouches to keep limber during matches. Websites list their gear, including the curvature and circumference of their preferred mouse.In February the Fusion posted a video on YouTube in which Gritty visited the players’ house, ate a trayful of subs, took a selfie, and, when leaving the bathroom, gave the universal sign for “It smells bad in here.”Overwatch isn’t the only competitive e-sport. Teams have also been formed to play League of Legends, Counter-Strike, Fortnite, and other games, potentially taking fans away from Overwatch. The game garnered tens of millions of regular players after its release in 2016, but it’s since been in decline, on some days barely ranking in the top 10 of most-viewed games on Twitch, the service owned by Amazon.com Inc., where fans watch livestreams of people playing. Todd Juenger, an analyst with Bernstein Research, said in a recent report that he thinks Activision will move up the release date for Overwatch 2, by a year, to 2020, to try to generate renewed interest.But recently, tickets to an Overwatch match were being offered at $10, compared with the usual $20. On a Friday night, the 528-seat theater was less than half full. “I am extremely skeptical that the current business model of e-sports can sustain the sort of hype that is going into it now,” says Frank Fields, an industry consultant.Roberts is undeterred. The recent deal with SK Telecom involves a half-dozen different games, an effort, he says, to “de-risk the portfolio” beyond Overwatch. “I think it could be bigger than some of the legacy sports,” he says of Comcast’s e-sports venture. “We don’t have to compete in just one game. We’re not just talking about, like, ice hockey, where it’s only popular in kind of cold regions. Everybody plays video games in every single country, and so that’s going to continue to be the glue that connects people.”Himself included. On Sunday mornings, Roberts wakes up and plays Overwatch with a group of childhood friends. “It’s a way to keep in touch,” he says. “We’re really bad, but we have a lot of fun.” Although right now Roberts reports to David Scott, Comcast Spectacor’s CEO, there’s a chance that someday he’ll be asked to succeed his father, much as Brian took over from his dad 17 years ago. Roberts says he’s daunted by the prospect. “People don’t understand how hard my dad works,” he says. Presumably, were he running a company with a market cap close to $190 billion, there wouldn’t be a lot of time left over to quell robotic uprisings and perfect his tank skills.Despite the recent murmurs of an e-sports bubble, Roberts sees an opportunity to reach a new generation of fans, particularly young men, who don’t follow traditional sports or watch regularly scheduled TV. People such as Andres Villegas, a 34-year-old event planner in Los Angeles, who comes to Overwatch games dressed in sandals and armor to cheer for the Los Angeles Gladiators. Overwatch, he says, “gives us nerds something to root for.” His favorite character is Mei, a Chinese climatologist-superhero who freezes enemies with an endothermic blaster. “If she were real, I’d marry her,” he says.

       "  \"Breaking down the boldest bets in business.The annual climbing window on Mount Everest just closed, and it was a doozy of a year, with a record number of people summiting and at least 11 fatalities. For people more familiar with navigating the corporate ladder, the mountain is a living, breathing lab for studying supply-chain management, leadership, team dynamics, and decision-making–specifically, flawed decision-making. The best breakdown of these dynamics can be found in a case penned by Michael Roberto when he was a Harvard professor. It provides a peek at the Everest experience without the frostbite and altitude sickness. Roberto focuses on the awfully fatal Himalayan climbing season of 1996, an imbroglio best described in Jon Krakauer’s book Into Thin Air. That May, five climbers died on one fatal summit push, including two of the mountain’s most-celebrated guides.Extreme mountaineering is an exercise in ignoring sunk costs—the time, labor, and money already invested. Roberto writes that “a dangerous escalation of commitment” occurs as climbers near the summit. One of the fated guides in 1996 had even established a hard stop—the “Two O’clock Rule”—to short-circuit debate on when to retreat. It's not a bad idea for any organization working on a risky venture. It’s also good framing for anyone about to suffer through an all-nighter at the office.  Tellingly, the group that overwhelmingly ignored pre-established turnaround times included some of the most experienced people on the mountain. This brings us to another common leadership flaw that Everest exposed: overconfidence. In the Himalayas, overconfidence can be linked to recency bias. In 1996, the guides had extra swagger in part because the mountain’s weather gods had been kind the previous few years. They minimized the many worst-case scenarios they’d been through in the distant past. Roberto, who now sells an Everest simulation to the C-suite crowd, says the best leaders uncover their biases and weigh decisions accordingly.Arguably most damning to the 1996 climbers were team dynamics. The guides were in the awkward position of bossing around paying clients, their customers and de facto managers. Meanwhile, climbers weren't encouraged to dissent or have open conversations. And what's worse, folks teamed up under a particular guiding service were largely strangers, unfamiliar with each others’ strengths, weaknesses, and work rates. It's a sound argument for team building. If you're going to climb Everest or do something similarly bold, do some trust falls first or, at the very least, some karaoke.Finally, there's the complexity of the task. Everest is essentially an on-demand environment, and any hiccup in the supply chain wreaks havoc all the way down the line. In 1996 the situation was exacerbated by customs delays on oxygen canisters and an unexpected wage negotiation with local porters. Guides spent hours fixing these issues when they should have been focused elsewhere. Sound like anyone in your office?The challenges on Everest this year are more macro than micro. Guides are blaming high casualties on a lax permitting system as the Nepal government tries to boost visitation. Meanwhile, a strong global economy has brought a crush of climbers, many inexperienced and unfit.In short, Roberto has the makings of another case on his hands.\"),\n",

       "  'Streaming will help Nigeria’s film industry, Africa’s most vibrant, reach a much wider audience.In December 2018, EbonyLife Films, a studio in Lagos, Nigeria, premiered Chief Daddy, a feature-length drama about an eccentric billionaire who dies suddenly, touching off a madcap scramble among his relatives over his estate. The movie was an immediate hit with audiences in Nigeria. By the end of the month it had emerged as the country’s most popular theatrical release of the year.Not long ago the economic life cycle of Chief Daddy might have ended there. Nollywood, the nickname for Nigeria’s robust film industry, has long been hamstrung by piracy. For years filmmakers have watched with frustration as swarms of illegitimate DVDs quickly overwhelmed their promising cinematic efforts, slashing potential profits and making it difficult to raise money to produce future films.But in the spring of 2019 the makers of Chief Daddy managed to cash in on a new window of opportunity, this time online. EbonyLife sold the movie’s global streaming rights to Netflix Inc., for an undisclosed sum. In March the streaming service made the movie available to 149 million customers in 190 countries, most of whom live well beyond the reach of those pirated DVDs.“As a continent, Africa has remained creatively silent for centuries, our stories are seldom told outside of our families and villages and often from the perspective of someone looking in,” says Mo Abudu, chief executive officer of EbonyLife. The arrival of streaming technology has the potential to upend that dynamic and introduce Nigerian films to a much broader market on both sides of the Atlantic, she says: “Now is a good opportunity for more capital to be pumped into Nollywood.”Netflix first launched its service in Africa in 2016. Since then the streaming giant has been ramping up its investment in African productions. Last September, Netflix acquired its first original film from Nollywood, Lionheart, a drama about a woman who steps into the male-dominated transportation industry when her father falls ill. This April, Netflix announced its first African animated series, Mama K’s Team 4, a futuristic tale about four teenage girls in Zambia who are recruited by a former secret agent to save the world. It’s being produced by Triggerfish Animation, a studio in South Africa. While declining to say how many subscribers Netflix has in Africa, a spokesman for the service pointed to several other African movies and series that it has in development.That’s welcome news to the Nollywood community, which since its inception in the 1990s has emerged as a promising source of growth within the Nigerian economy. According to a 2017 report by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, Nollywood is the second-largest producer of films in the world, trailing only India’s Bollywood. Nigeria’s arts, entertainment, and recreation sector, of which Nollywood is a significant part, generated 239 billion naira ($664 million) in 2016 and is projected to continue growing. Nigeria’s National Film and Video Censors Board estimates that the number of West African films released annually between 2015 and 2017 more than doubled, to 87.In the past, Nollywood movies have been heavily consumed across Africa and rarely seen outside the continent. But the industry’s boosters point to the recent success of several Western movies—including Walt Disney Co.’s Black Panther (which grossed $1.3 billion globally and was the top-selling movie ever in West Africa, according to Nigeria’s film board) and Beasts of No Nation, the critically acclaimed film distributed by Netflix about a boy soldier fighting in a civil war in West Africa—as evidence of growing demand among U.S. and European audiences for stories rooted in African culture, traditions, and mythology.While Nollywood films typically lack the kind of big-budget production values that U.S. and European moviegoers are accustomed to, creators in the region say the industry has gradually been shifting from mostly low-quality DVD releases toward slicker productions for both home video and cinematic release. To make more big-budget films, the industry will need to attract deeper, more reliable pools of financing.In May top Nollywood producers, filmmakers, and executives traveled to France for the Cannes Film Festival’s first “Pavillon Afriques,” a series of sessions and screenings highlighting the opportunities and challenges facing filmmakers from across the continent. Their goal: raising visibility for Nollywood and participating in discussions about financing, dealmaking, and the expansion of distribution. Inya Lawal, founder of Nigerian production house Ascend Studios, hopes the focus on African filmmaking at Cannes will show that programming can be done on a global scale. “It’s been a process to get here,” she says.Nollywood creators continue to grapple with less than ideal conditions at home. Kunle Afolayan, a Nigerian director and producer, says that while the arrival of streaming and video-on-demand services has made monetizing Nollywood movies easier, piracy is still “eating deep into the industry.” He has four films slated for DVD release but is having trouble “because nobody is willing to take the distribution responsibility” given the likelihood that pirated copies could hit the streets the very next day.Still, Nollywood veterans are hopeful the industry is poised to prosper in the emerging era of globally connected home entertainment. “We have an enabling environment,” says Afolayan. “The content makers are hungry for work. Anybody who comes in now is coming in at the right time.” —With Tope Alake and Karen Toulon'),\n",

       "  'The number of articles optioned by Hollywood studios has soared in the past decade, and so have the prices.PHOTOGRAPHER: SEAN GLADWELL/GETTY IMAGESAs a peripatetic writer for national magazines, David Kushner has traveled to some far-flung destinations. He has trained to be a cosmonaut in Moscow for Wired and sampled glacial vodka in Anchorage for Outside. Recently, Kushner’s work has required that he make frequent return trips to a less exotic locale—Hollywood.Since optioning the rights to his first book, Masters of Doom, in 2003, Kushner has sold 15 projects to different entertainment studios, including the British Broadcasting Corp., the boutique movie studio A24, and Netflix. Last winter, Kushner sold the streaming service Hulu the rights to turn his past stories into TV shows and to have the first look at any of his new projects. Executives at Hulu are now sifting through Kushner’s magazine oeuvre to see what could make for a distinctive series, assuming anything is left.“Just about everything is being optioned,” says Kushner. “Next to Stephen King, I may be the most optioned writer in Hollywood.”He isn’t the only one cashing in. Chris Jones, a longtime glossy magazine writer, is producing and writing for Netflix’s space drama Away, which is based on an article he wrote for Esquire. Journalist Michelle Dean is working as a writer and showrunner for a Hulu series based on a true-crime article she wrote for BuzzFeed. Magazine writers may be an increasingly endangered species, but some fortunate ones have joined the diverse list of professionals—showrunners, actors, stylists, crew members, caterers—who are benefiting from the phenomenon known as Peak TV.A slew of deep-pocketed companies—including Netflix, Amazon, Apple, and Walmart—are jockeying with traditional media conglomerates over the future of home entertainment. They’ve done this in part by commissioning lavish amounts of original programming, inadvertently touching off an inflationary boom in TV production. In 2018 the number of scripted TV shows neared 500, according to data from the cable network FX. That’s more than double the amount produced a decade ago.Along the way, the number of magazine articles optioned by TV studios and streaming services has soared, and so have the prices. Articles that studios used to pay $5,000 or $10,000 to option are now going for $20,000 to $50,000. A few have even sold for north of $100,000. And that’s just for the right to develop the article into a TV show.The purchase price—the writer’s fee if the studio produces the project—now routinely surpasses $350,000, and has climbed as high as $1 million, according to interviews with more than a dozen industry executives. “With the explosion of outlets, there is a need for more and more intellectual property,” says Brad Simpson, producer of The People v. O.J. Simpson and Pose.The figures may escalate as new streaming services from AT&T, Walt Disney, and Apple enter the market. Some of the new services are already corralling articles for development. Apple Inc. is developing an anthology series entitled Little America that’s based on a number of articles that appeared in Epic Magazine.Journalists Josh Davis and Joshuah Bearman—who started Epic in 2013 as a conduit for channeling magazine journalism into Hollywood production deals—are serving as executive producers on the series. In April, Vox Media, the digital media company partially backed by NBC Universal, announced it was acquiring Epic for an undisclosed amount.Journalists and media organizations sometimes clash over who reaps the benefits of Hollywood development deals based on their work. Vox and Condé Nast (owner of the New Yorker, Wired, and GQ) have formed entertainment divisions that are capitalizing on the boom. Condé Nast is producing Last Chance U, based on a 2014 GQ article, and Fastest Car, an original production, for Netflix. Vox is making a slate of food shows for Hulu. How derivative entertainment revenue gets split up is now a common source of friction during contract negotiations between writers and news organizations. In February, the Los Angeles Times’ union fought efforts by its owners to grab control over any outside projects, including TV shows.While there’s nothing new about the entertainment industry buying rights to nonfiction stories (just ask Michael Lewis), the advent of social media has accelerated the rush to turn the latest viral news phenomenon into a bankable narrative experience—be it a longform article, podcast series, quick turnaround documentary, streaming miniseries, feature film, or all of the above. The fierce competition of Peak TV has made studios increasingly wary of getting boxed out.Even if a studio has an original idea, it will sometimes buy a project just for the promotional value of being able to say that a show was based on a true story, according to Geoff Manaugh, a journalist who has optioned several of his articles, a book, and short stories. Manaugh’s first deal in Hollywood was based on an article he wrote for the Daily Beast about a bank robber who said he helped the government plot heists against al-Qaeda. It prompted a bidding war. “That opened up the floodgates,” he said. “Once you have one thing optioned, people want to know what is next.”Not long ago, studios would go around a nonfiction writer and reach out directly to the subject of a story. But now with the price of top showrunners soaring and the supply of quality writers in tight supply, studios are increasingly enlisting magazine writers to help in the process of turning an article into a show.It can be an enticing proposition. TV presents a high-paying alternative to the world of magazines, where stories can sit with an editor for months and the number of issues published every year dwindles. Stories can languish in Hollywood forever too, but at least the writer gets paid every time a studio puts something in development.While Kushner isn’t ready to move to Los Angeles, he’s beginning to reconsider his career. “I’m starting work on a couple projects where I’m skipping the magazine or book part and going straight to developing them for TV,” he says. “Maybe to tell a true story, you don’t need to write it as a magazine article or a book anymore.”'),\n",
       " ('The Corporate World Has Its Own Inequality Problem',\n",
       "  '2019-05-09',\n",
       "  'With 10% of the companies making 80% of the money, those in the middle get squeezed from both ends.Liberals have a blind spot about inequality. They decry disparity between individuals—the fact, for example, that the 10 richest people in America have more money than the bottom 160 million. But they overlook inequality among companies, instead viewing Big Business as a troublesome monolith. During the 2016 presidential campaign, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont occasionally tarred business with a broad brush, once saying the chiefs of large multinational companies “ain’t going to like me.”The surprising truth is there’s as much inequality among large companies as there is among people. As with individuals, a handful of companies make the lion’s share of profits, while struggling companies do so poorly they actually destroy value for their shareholders and debtholders. In the middle is a stressed-out majority: unable to keep up with the best, while pressured by the desperate tactics of the worst.Inequality in the corporate world isn’t new. Perfect competition—with millions of small, roughly equal businesses battling it out on a level playing field—was never more than a teaching device in intro economics textbooks. What’s new, though, is that the polarization is increasing. The rich businesses are getting richer and the poor poorer.A 2018 study from McKinsey Global Institute analyzes 5,750 companies around the world that have $1 billion or more in annual revenue and account for roughly two-thirds of all global pretax profits. The institute—the think tank of the global consulting firm McKinsey & Co.—calculates that the best-performing 10th of the companies captured about 80 percent of all the economic profit in 2014 through 2016, up from 75 percent a decade earlier. The top 1 percent of the companies captured 36 percent.Those extreme winners—McKinsey doesn’t name names, but the group obviously includes the likes of Apple, Facebook, and Microsoft—are the companies Sanders focuses on. But for people in the business world, equally important are the losers in the fight for market share and profitability.Those laggards are doing surprisingly badly. “The bottom 10 percent destroy as much value as superstars create,” McKinseyites Sree Ramaswamy, Michael Birshan, James Manyika, Jacques Bughin, and Jonathan Woetzel wrote in an April article on the McKinsey website. The worst of the worst, about the bottom 2 percent, are technically “zombies”—finance lingo for companies whose cash flow doesn’t cover their interest expenses.In between the superstars and the losers are all the rest of the companies, running around like extras in a disaster movie trying to avoid getting crushed. “If you’re a middling company, you’re essentially being squeezed at both ends,” Ramaswamy says in an interview. “It’s becoming harder to survive and grow.”By decile of economic profit, 3-year average, 2014-16Data: McKinsey & Co.McKinsey uses economic profit—how much a company earns above its cost of capital—as its measure of performance, because it captures what really matters to investors. To take an extreme example, a company that raised $100 billion in stocks and bonds and then earned just a thousand bucks in net income would still show up as profitable in the books reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission. But such a puny return on invested capital would disappoint the investors who bought its equity and debt. Economic profit adjusts for the returns that investors expect in exchange for the risk they take when they put in their money. That hypothetical giant earning $1,000 would have a highly negative economic profit.A picture similar to McKinsey’s emerges in research on a bigger set of global companies by Aswath Damodaran, an accounting expert at New York University’s Stern School of Business. Instead of companies clustering around an average level of profitability, he, too, detected a bimodal distribution: As of January, he found, 8,300 big companies had strongly positive economic profit (return on invested capital exceeding weighted average cost of capital by 5 percentage points or more), while about 17,000 had strongly negative economic profit (returns trailed capital cost by 5 percentage points or more). In the profit space between those two extremes, where ordinarily you’d expect to find the vast majority of companies, he found only about 11,000—fewer than a third of the total.This is the polarized world that economists Robert Frank of Cornell University and Philip Cook of Duke University predicted in 1995 in The Winner-Take-All Society. Their key insight was that returns in many businesses are nonlinear: A player with just a slight edge stands to win the entire pot, while a close second gets little or nothing, because why would any customer choose the second best?Globalization exacerbated the winner-take-all phenomenon. When transportation and communication were expensive and regulatory barriers and tariffs high, each city would have its own local champions, whether brewers or piano makers or banks. Most were swept away when they were exposed to national and then international competition. Says Frank: “You can’t make an OK cellphone. You’ve got to be one of the very best if not the best to even survive.”It’s easy to draw a line from company inequality to individual inequality: Superstar companies pay their own people well, but they are highly productive so they don’t have a lot of employees per dollar of sales or profit. And as they gain market share, employment by their competitors shrinks. Workers lose, while capitalists win. So concludes a 2017 paper by David Autor of Massachusetts Institute of Technology and four other authors called The Fall of the Labor Share and the Rise of Superstar Firms.Ramaswamy and his McKinsey co-authors found that superstar companies do more research and development than average and rely more than average on mergers and acquisitions for growth. As for companies in the bottom profit decile, they actually do more conventional capital spending than the average big company, perhaps because they tend to be in sectors that depend more on physical capital than ideas.Think of the plight of a wireless company like Sprint Corp., which has fewer customers paying less per month than Verizon Communications Inc. or AT&T Inc. and yet has to invest heavily in its network to have any hope of success, says Bloomberg Intelligence senior industry analyst John Butler. Again, McKinsey’s study doesn’t name companies, but Sprint appears in a Bloomberg screen of U.S. companies with the weakest performance in terms of return on invested capital vs. weighted average cost of capital. (A spokeswoman for Sprint declined to comment.)Researchers disagree on whether superstar companies are becoming more entrenched. McKinsey says that according to its research, half the superstars lose their standing in an average business cycle. And when they fall, they often fall hard: “Over the past 20 years, 40 percent of companies that lost their top positions fell to the bottom decile of economic profit. In the most recent business cycle, more than 50 percent of superstars that lost their top positions fell to the bottom decile,” according to the April article.MIT’s Autor says McKinsey’s figures exaggerate the likelihood that companies will rise or fall. In an email, he wrote, “We find that Superstar persistence has increased not declined over time.” Plus, he added, the superstars are getting bigger: “There’s little question that concentration is rising in many industries. That’s pretty well established by now by many independent inquiries.”There’s anecdotal support for either argument, McKinsey’s or Autor’s. On one hand, companies such as CVS Health Corp. and Walt Disney Co. do appear to have an iron grip on power. “I just don’t see any challengers to the big companies we worry about in every sector. There’s not a lot of dynamism,” says Sally Hubbard, director of enforcement strategy at the Open Markets Institute.On the other hand, plenty of companies that once seemed invincible have been brought low. Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and American International Group Inc. required government rescues in the financial crisis; energy giant Enron was felled in 2001 by an accounting scandal. As for companies going from the bottom to the top—that happens, too. Apple was nearly dead in 1997 and is now among the world’s most valuable companies. Delta Air Lines Inc. is the world’s most valuable airline just 14 years after a bankruptcy judge told its executives, “I have not heard anything that I will say remotely impressed me that you have the money, the talent, or the thought that you could successfully reorganize in this case.”Those who say superstars are entrenched advocate strong measures—including antitrust lawsuits—to increase competition. Such steps would be unnecessary if market forces alone were strong enough to drag down the superstars. Some superstars, like Apple, produce so much cash that they use big dividends and share repurchases just to keep up with the flow. But buybacks are also characteristic of some poor performers, which hand back money to shareholders since there’s no good use for it in their shrinking sectors.Companies that are earning less than their cost of capital can be as problematic for competitors as superstars, because their money-losing ways erode profit margins for everyone else. For buzzy startups such as Uber Technologies Inc., pricing below total cost is a temporary (they hope) strategy for building scale. For established companies that have fallen on hard times, slashing prices can be a “gamble for resurrection.” Since the stock is near zero anyway, shareholders have little to lose by taking a chance that roils the industry—think of an airline operating under bankruptcy protection. In 2017 the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development published an economic policy paper titled Confronting the Zombies: Policies for Productivity Revival that recommended changing bankruptcy codes to more speedily shut down companies that deserve to die.Those who worry about individual inequality might spare a thought for corporate inequality. Fixing one might help the other.'),\n",

       "  '2019-05-07',\n",
       "  'Old-guard financial firms are targeting youngsters like Netflix Inc. with apps that can help customers weed out payments for services they no longer use or have forgotten about -- even as options to take on more monthly expenses multiply.The applications, including those from Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Wells Fargo & Co. and Discover Financial Services, assist users in finding recurring fees and in some cases cancel them or renegotiate their costs. Gym memberships, food-of-the-month-club dues, cable commitments, as well as video-streaming services such as Netflix and Hulu, are all vulnerable to impulsive house cleaning. The apps, which sometimes take a cut from the money they save, can also alert subscribers when services hike prices.That’s ironic considering that Apple Inc., Walt Disney Co., AT&T Inc. and Comcast Corp. are all planning new streaming services. Hulu reported last month that cancellation rates hit an all-time low. And Netflix, with a 35 percent revenue jump last year from 2017, has raised prices.So the new banking tools may not be taking a noticeable bite out of business just yet. But there are signs they might. At Clarity Money, an app owned by Goldman Sachs with 2 million subscribers, two of the three most-canceled expenses are video services, according to Kelly Newton, vice president of marketing. Cord cutting -- getting rid of cable -- hit a record in the first quarter, according to BTIG LLC.Clarity Money app“Every week it’s like there’s a new subscription we’ve signed up for and the bank account is drained by the end of it,” said Mark Schwanhausser, director of digital banking at research firm Javelin Strategy. The new financial tools “contribute to a smarter, more aware consumer.”Consumers have begun to notice that money is streaming out of their bank accounts regardless of whether they use the services, and they’ve begun sorting out the expenses. The apps are banking that making it easier will be big business for them.A while back, Americans woke up to the practice of canceling $85-plus monthly cable bills in favor of cheaper individual options -- even if it meant lengthy phone discussions with a cable provider and having to return equipment to their office. Today, the average U.S. household subscribes to three streaming-video services, with 43 percent paying for both streaming and traditional pay TV, according to Deloitte’s annual Digital Media Trends survey. Nearly half, however, are frustrated by the growing number of outlets they need to access to get what they want to watch.Mocking the avalanche of offerings, Colin Jost on “Saturday Night Live’’ joked that Disney’s new streaming service was called Disney+, “as in, you now have to get Disney, plus Hulu, plus Netflix, plus Amazon, plus PlayStation, plus cable.”But for all their future-world cache, streaming services don’t appear to have plans to combat one-click cancellations. Netflix, Hulu, Disney and Amazon all declined to comment. Comcast said it works directly with customers to protect account and personal information.“This is the single most important aspect of the direct-to-consumer business model that legacy media executives are not prepared for,” said Richard Greenfield at BTIG.Discover used Netflix as an example in its advertising “simply to describe recurring payments to those who might not be familiar with the term,” said spokesman Derek Cuculich.Wells Fargo has jumped in, too. The bank is offering “Control Tower,” which scans recurring payments. In advertisements, a narrator tells a character named Jerry that “It’s time to clean house.’’ The bank started the service after a poll showed 31 percent of Americans had paid for subscriptions or memberships that they didn’t use in the past year. Respondents said they had an average of three paid subscriptions that were unused or not needed.“Corporations in America today make money when people aren’t paying attention,’’ said Thomas Smyth, whose Trim financial-management app, which cancels unwanted services, has grown to 500,000 subscribers since it launched in 2015. “We live in a subscription economy. If you’re paying for anything and it’s not a subscription today, it will be tomorrow.”'),\n",
       " ('Barilla Pasta’s Turnaround From Homophobia to National Pride',\n",
       "  '2019-05-07',\n",
       "  'After chairman Guido Barilla rebuked gay families on national radio, his CEO spent five years cleaning up the company’s reputation.On a warm September evening in 2013, Claudio Colzani drove his Audi the 100 or so miles from Milan to Parma, home for almost two centuries to the world’s largest pasta empire. He had joined Barilla SpA as chief executive officer less than a year before and was on his way to a dinner with its chairman, Guido Barilla, who was giving a live interview on national station Radio 24. As the sun edged lower in his rearview mirror, Colzani turned up the volume and listened as his boss walked the hosts through the company’s family heritage—its spaghettis and sauces. Then Barilla dropped a bombshell he would spend half a decade atoning for.“I would never do a commercial with a homosexual family, not for lack of respect, but because we don’t agree with them,” Barilla said on Italy’s best-known radio talk show. If gay customers didn’t like that, they could go buy another brand of pasta, he said. Barilla, who together with his three siblings owns 85 percent of the company’s shares and holds an individual stake worth about $1.1 billion, extolled the values of the “classic family” that the brand targeted. The chairman, who turned 60 last year and has five children, further clarified that he opposed adoption by gay parents.Colzani was stunned. He immediately called Luca Virginio, the company’s head of communications, shouting into the phone, “What the hell is going on?” It would take another half-hour to arrive at Parma’s Ristorante Cocchi and confront his boss about the magnitude of his mistake. In that time, and in the weeks that followed, social media ignited with outrage as people accused Barilla of homophobia. Amid calls for a global boycott, Colzani’s family and friends asked what he was doing running that sort of business, and members of his leadership team said they felt deeply uncomfortable. Harvard pulled the pasta from its dining halls, and major retailers in the U.S. and Europe asked to meet with Colzani to clarify the company’s stance. The list of celebrities pledging to shun the brand included Jodi Picoult and Chrissy Teigen, who suggested in a tweet to her 11 million followers that she would fund gay pornography filmed in a bathtub filled with linguine.“I was concerned about the market share, but I was much more worried about people perceiving Barilla as an out-of-date brand,” Colzani said in a February interview at Barilla’s headquarters, a steel-and-glass low-rise next to a sprawling factory that produces almost 1,000 tons of pasta per day. (Through a spokesman, Guido Barilla and his siblings declined to be interviewed.) The finance team alerted Colzani to a marginal dip in the company’s sales, but the commercial impact was microscopic. In the consumer-goods industry, short-term losses can usually be recovered through small price adjustments. At $3.2 billion (excluding currency fluctuations), Barilla’s revenue was ultimately higher in 2013, the year its chairman made the comments, than in 2012, and higher still in 2014.Because the bigger preoccupation for consumer brands tends to be cachet—an abstraction valued in the tens of billions of dollars on their balance sheets as “intangible assets”—irrelevance can have worse financial consequences than brief buffers in a company’s revenue streams. In February, Kraft Heinz Co. admitted its products were failing to connect with diners who increasingly turned their back on industrialized food when it wrote $15.4 billion—more than half the group’s annual sales—off the value of Oscar Mayer hot dogs and Velveeta processed cheese.For decades, Barilla was unshakable. As the flag-bearer for mass-market pasta, the company not only survived Atkins and other low-carb diets but thrived on an image of authenticity. In the U.S., dry pasta brands are generally interchangeable, only further anonymized when doused in marinara. But Barilla’s serial promotion of its ties to Italian home cooking in television ads set to an Andrea Bocelli song earned it a quarter of the U.S. pasta market. Colzani now watched that carefully curated image unravel in real time. He measured the brand’s declining appeal with customers on a monthly basis using tools developed by Millward Brown, a market-research company owned by advertising conglomerate WPP Plc. In 2014, Barilla dropped 21 spots on the Reputation Institute’s annual ranking of companies.Before Barilla, Colzani had enjoyed a 25-year career at Unilever, most recently in New Jersey, where he was chief customer officer and sat on the diversity committee. He first registered an interest in joining Barilla after hearing its chairman speak at a consumer-products forum in Barcelona in 2011 about the company’s commitment to fighting obesity through better nutrition. But the 2013 incident served as a stark reminder that, in Italy, “the debate on LGBT issues came very, very late compared to many other European countries,” Colzani said. He attributed the lag to the overwhelming influence of religion on moral philosophy in a country where about 70 percent of citizens identify as Catholic.Colzani called former colleagues for counsel and appointed a chief diversity and inclusion officer. He leaned on workplace consultants Korn Ferry for advice and formed an external advisory board. U.S. public-relations company Edelman was drafted to steer communications. Colzani started spending about $5 million a year devising an ambitious reputational turnaround. For the past five years the company has earned the highest possible score on the Human Rights Campaign’s corporate equality index. Barilla transformed from a pasta giant that would never feature homosexuals in its campaigns into one that sells spaghetti in homoerotic packaging.\\n Barilla was founded by Pietro Barilla in 1877 as a small bakery on a merchant road in downtown Parma, a city with pillared churches and bustling piazzas at almost every turn. It has a storied association with the country’s finest food—its namesake province is home to the acclaimed Culatello cut of cured ham and to Parmigiano cheese, often imitated outside the region as “Parmesan.”Today, Barilla is a superpower. It owns about a dozen food brands, including high-end Voiello pasta and Wasabrod, the world’s largest producer of Scandinavian crispbread, and last year sold about $4 billion worth of products in more than 100 countries. For much of its early history, Barilla had incomparable clout in Italy’s pantries, boasting in commercials that its products were the backbone ingredients in the majority of pasta dishes plated in family homes across the nation. Today it accounts for a little less than half of Italy’s pasta, with its nearest rival, De Cecco, making up a distant 10 percent. Twenty years ago, Barilla generated almost all of its revenue at home, but now, Italy accounts for about a third of its sales. That number is expected to drop as Barilla seeks growth from developing markets such as Russia and Turkey, Colzani said. He’s also bullish on new noodles aimed at the post-yoga crowd: vegan and gluten-free penne made from red lentils.The business has fallen out of family control only once, for about a decade, when it was reluctantly sold to U.S. chemical conglomerate W.R. Grace & Co. In the early 1970s the construction of Barilla’s new factory on the outskirts of Parma took an enormous financial toll, and Italy’s government set price controls on the majority of the company’s products. Since reacquiring Barilla in 1979, the family has advocated for the sort of costly long-term initiatives that tend to fare better at private companies than publicly listed ones.Colzani said that during his six years at the helm, he’s never had a conversation with the Barillas about boosting profit. Instead, discussions have revolved around environmental efforts, such as hiking the company’s costs by about €40 million ($45 million) a year to rid its supply chain of palm oil, which it did in 2017. Barilla is also working with the farmers who supply the durum wheat for its pasta to end their use of glyphosate-based herbicides, which the World Health Organization classifies as probably carcinogenic to humans.This sort of progressive work only fuels the romanticism Barilla enjoys as one of Italy’s largest family-owned businesses. This same dynamic has been championed by the families behind chocolatier Ferrero SpA’s generous funding of literature and science programs, distiller Davide Campari-Milano SpA’s partnership with the contemporary art fair in Turin, and coffee giant Luigi Lavazza SpA’s mission to improve livelihoods in the countries from which it sources its beans. “I think most of the owners perceive the company as an extension of their families, and one positive is that it triggers a sense of belonging for employees,” Massimo Magni, who lectures on organizational behavior at Bocconi University’s school of management, said of the nation’s corporate kindred. “But a pitfall is that the family will often take more of a paternalistic approach than a management approach.”That sense is even stronger at a company such as Barilla, which brands its namesake product as a cornerstone of national identity. The alignment of its advertising with the Italian idyll of a nuclear, traditional family gathered around a home-cooked lasagna reflected a lifestyle the vast majority of the country’s citizens are proud to lead. Italy still has one of the worst records for gay rights in Western Europe, according to a regional arm of the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association. Last year the country placed in the lower half on the advocacy group’s annual ranking of European nations, based on marriage equality, reports of hate crimes, and other metrics.Barilla is not the only Italian pasta maker to come under fire for homophobia. In February, Italy’s Supreme Court ruled that Gian Luca Rana, the CEO of Verona’s family-owned Pastificio Rana SpA, had caused “concrete and serious prejudice to the dignity” of a manager he’d repeatedly addressed as finocchio, the Italian word for “fennel,” which is also a homophobic slur. Rana defended his use of the word as innocuous in the context of collegial workplace banter. Even though Guido Barilla immediately apologized for the comments he made on the Radio 24 talk show, he drew ire for sounding phlegmatic—he referred to having offended “the sensitivities of some people.”Some attitudes are less equivocal. In the first parliamentary session that followed the chairman’s interview, Gianluca Buonanno, a politician in the right-wing Lega party, provoked two openly gay colleagues with a fennel bulb and attempted to physically assault one of them. The following month, in an unconnected event, a 21-year-old gay medical student who had been a victim of bullying dialed 10 suicide hotlines before jumping to his death from the 11th floor of a former pasta factory in Rome. “Italy is a free country but there is homophobia,” a note found after his death reportedly read. “Those who have these attitudes must deal with their conscience.” It was the third suicide by a young gay man in Rome that year.During this same period of time, workers at Barilla—which employs about 8,500 globally at more than 50 factories and offices—expressed shock and dismay. The chairman’s comments struck some as especially provincial, given his otherwise international outlook. “I know Guido very well, and he told us many times in small groups that he made a mistake and apologized for embarrassing us as employees, because he’s not like that, and the company isn’t like that,” said Alessandro Spadini, who’s worked for the pasta maker for almost three decades and runs the Pedrignano plant adjacent to its headquarters.Global retail sales and where brand loyalties fall among American votersData: Euromonitor International, Simmons Research National Consumer Study Fall 2018The fourth Barilla in as many generations to lead the company, Guido Barilla joined the business in 1986 and drove much of its expansion abroad before taking over the chairmanship from his father, who died in 1993. After studying philosophy in Italy, he’d started his career at several food companies in the U.S., a country to which he’d retained a sentimental connection after competing as a track-and-field athlete at Boston College. He keeps an apartment in Manhattan, and two of his sons are enrolled at his alma mater in Massachusetts, where they’re members of the soccer and tennis teams.Outside of a board directorship at French yogurt giant Danone SA, Barilla lives and breathes the family’s pasta empire. He dresses the part of the modern industrialist, matching understated ties to dark suits cut to his tall, slim frame. Before his on-air misstep, his only public eccentricity had been the styling of his gray hair, which oscillates between a military trim and an unkempt musketeer’s mop. He eats Barilla pasta daily and prefers it unadulterated, renouncing sauce in favor of light Parmigiano shavings and a shallow spoonful of olive oil.The most remarkable thing about the chairman’s interview was just how unremarkable it was in the context of the hostile rhetoric of Italy’s most powerful businessmen. In 2015, Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana, the billionaire founders of the eponymous Milan-based fashion house, proclaimed in an interview with Panorama magazine that “the only family is the traditional one” and that children conceived with the help of in vitro fertilization were the “synthetic” sum of “semen from a catalogue” and a “rented uterus.” Despite being a couple for 23 years before a split in 2005, they also spoke out against same-sex marriage. Their views were condemned by leading voices: Elton John called for a boycott, and Victoria Beckham expressed her love and support for his family, which was conceived through IVF. In recent months, haute couture powerhouses Gucci SpA and Prada SpA have introduced and subsequently withdrawn an $890 turtleneck sweater deplored for resembling blackface imagery and a $550 monkey figurine reminiscent of anti-black caricatures. Although the companies have denied any subliminal messaging, the designs come as Italy’s xenophobic discourse soars under its right-wing government, which views immigration as a threat to national identity.At Barilla, Colzani is determined that the company resist the backward direction of the country, which entered recession for the third time in a decade in January and has seen the annual number of racial and homophobic attacks steadily rise. He’s adamant that instead of priding itself on reflecting the country’s culture, Barilla should lead it by projecting a better ideal. After the radio interview, Colzani plotted three chapters: apology, investigation, and promotion. “We were simply trying to be a good citizen. Now, we’re trying to be a role model.”The strategy to right-size Barilla’s image falls in line with a wider attempt the business has taken to appeal to more-discerning shoppers. Over the past decade, with carbohydrates under siege from fashionable ketogenic and paleo diets, the company has directly funded or is tied to more than 10 peer-reviewed studies that have touted pasta’s nutritional benefits. The Barilla Center for Food & Nutrition has co-hosted breakfasts at the World Economic Forum in Davos promoting sustainability initiatives.The radio interview effectively rescinded Barilla’s seat at the table with progressives, whom it needed to ensure the long-term viability of the brand. “I would guarantee that there would have been virtually no drop-off in sales, because capability—Does the pasta taste good? Is the distribution effective?—means more to the customer than character, which has more saliency with employees, retailers, and community partners,” said Rupert Younger, who leads the Oxford University Centre for Corporate Reputation and is a co-founder of communications company Finsbury. Instead, a typical betterment catalyst in cases such as Barilla’s is the landslide of staff—including senior managers—voicing their anger at the discriminatory statements, he said.\\n The week after his comments, Guido agreed to meet with Parks Liberi e Uguali, a nonprofit that works with employers on LGBT inclusion, and the Tyler Clementi Foundation, which focuses on ending bullying and online harassment. Colzani implemented diversity and inclusion training and unconscious bias courses for the entire workforce. Now employees are asked every 18 months whether they feel their leaders are committed to building more-diverse teams. (In the latest assessment, 72 percent of participants said yes, up from 65 percent in the previous one.) Almost 1,000 workers have formed and joined employee resource groups, each focused on a specific theme, such as refugee training or gender and sexual identity. Beatrice Burlenghi and Martina Olivola, the leaders of the latter group, nicknamed Voce, distributed Barilla-branded rainbow bracelets to employees after meeting with a similar group at General Electric Co. that had done the same.All the company’s efforts are supervised by Kristen Anderson, the chief diversity and inclusion officer and a former chemical engineer on Barilla’s research and development team. She also heads an internal committee of about a dozen employees that meets every two months to gauge progress on initiatives such as co-creating packaging with disabled customers and promoting women to leadership positions. Colzani’s request for a separate board of external advisers was tougher to deliver on, because most of the potential candidates Barilla approached didn’t want to be affiliated with the company, Anderson said. David Mixner, a civil rights activist, author, and playwright once named by Newsweek magazine as the most powerful gay man in America, refused four times to meet with Guido Barilla before finally agreeing to it as a personal favor to a friend who worked in public relations.“I joined the boycott and said I wouldn’t meet with him, because I’m so sick of going to these things and hearing nothing but apologies,” Mixner said. He finally relented and met the chairman for lunch at the Glass House Tavern near Times Square. Before sitting down at the restaurant, which has a crispy chicken salad named after him, Mixner instructed the waiters to speed up the service so he could leave within the hour. He and Barilla ended up spending four hours at the table, during which the 72-year-old Mixner spoke of the pain he’d suffered for being gay. He’d spent three years estranged from his family, lost jobs, and been the target of a hate crime. Barilla said his family had a long history of combating injustice, with his father having been involved with members of the resistance against Italy’s fascist regime in the 1940s.The company now pays Mixner an annual stipend of $25,000 to serve on the advisory board. It has also sponsored some of his plays, the proceeds of which have gone to the Ali Forney Center, an organization based in New York that helps homeless gay youths find shelter, and efforts to advance marriage equality in Italy. Since his lunch with Barilla, Mixner has become the chairman’s most trusted confidant on diversity issues. “I got a lot of grief from the LGBT community when I agreed to help him out,” Mixner said. “But I told them that the purpose of a movement is to change minds.”At the company’s annual staff meeting in December, Barilla showed a short film in which an American employee narrated, “Five years have passed since the beginning of our journey.” Pictures of Mixner and the company’s chairman hugging flashed on the screen to a solemn piano solo as the narrator said that Barilla had come to learn that love is blind, because it makes no distinctions of gender, religion, or race.Two months earlier, at the Pasta World Championship in Milan, Barilla did exactly what its chairman had promised would never happen: It unveiled a limited edition of its most popular product, Spaghetti No.\\u20095, wrapped in a box illustrated with two women holding hands, a single strand of pasta held between their lips in a nod to Walt Disney Co.’s Lady and the Tramp. It was designed by Olimpia Zagnoli, an Italian artist who had advocated for boycotting Barilla in 2013.There’s still a way to go. When Burlenghi, the Voce team leader, participated in the most recent Pride march in Milan wearing a Barilla T-shirt, she was asked by fellow attendees if the company had paid her to walk on its behalf. Barilla hasn’t received many compliments for its efforts from its former critics, Colzani said. “They say, ‘You’re OK. You’re still in repair mode.’ Which I think is a fair comment. We’ll always try to improve ourselves before telling others we’re fine.”Barilla still leans on its heritage, though. In the middle of the lobby at the company’s headquarters, a screen updates about every 10 seconds with thousands of Instagram posts pooled from every continent that promote the Mediterranean diet or dishes made with Barilla’s products. Opposite, a floor-to-ceiling painting hangs on the wall, based on a black-and-white photograph of the pasta maker’s first shop in Parma. The canvas is brightened by a loud diagonal dash of yellow that reads, “Di che pasta sei fatto?” a colloquialism in Italian that means “What are you made of?” '),\n",

       " ('Zalando Brings Massive CEO Compensation Packages to Germany',\n",
       "  '2019-05-01',\n",
       "  'The leaders of a fashion retail powerhouse could become Europe’s highest-paid executives if they meet moonshot growth targets.(From left) Zalando co-CEOs David Schneider, Robert Gentz, and Rubin Ritter.Thrift and discretion have traditionally been seen as virtues in Germany—even in executive suites. Companies long resisted publishing individual compensation of top managers, whose pay is often a fraction of what many of their global peers receive. German chief executive officers rarely get more than €10 million ($11.2 million) annually. Volkswagen AG paid its CEO around €8 million last year, less than half the $22 million Mary Barra made at General Motors Co., even though VW’s sales are almost twice the size of GM’s. And on average, German leaders earn 97 times as much as employees, vs. 312 times as much at the biggest U.S. companies, according to the Economic Policy Institute in Washington.Yet a trio of German millennials could upend the status quo—and become Europe’s highest-paid executives in the process. Zalando SE’s three co-CEOs—Robert Gentz, David Schneider, and Rubin Ritter—stand to rake in a combined $570 million if they can more than triple the share price and roughly double the sales generated by Europe’s largest online fashion retailer within five years.While that’s a huge upside, the downside is equally striking: If the managers fail to meet the ambitious targets, they’ll each have to make do with pay of just €65,000 a year. Berlin-based Zalando’s package is “a revolution and a total exception in Germany,” says Heinz Evers, a consultant who advises companies on executive pay.Average 2018 compensation of a chief executive of a company* in the nation’s benchmark indexData: Compiled by Bloomberg*Companies are also members of the Bloomberg ESG Index, disclose CEO pay, and have done so for calendar year 2018. Benchmark indexes, in order of nations: S&P 500, DAX, FTSE 100, CAC 40, S&P/TSX, Sensex.Germany, like the rest of Europe, trails the U.S. in another regard: the number of young tech successes like Zalando. Other than corporate-software maker SAP SE, it has no global tech giants to compete with the likes of Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, or Facebook. Instead, the DAX benchmark index is filled with manufacturing, finance, and chemical companies that have been around for decades or even centuries, often with strong family ties.Ritter, who already collected €20.2 million last year under two previous incentive plans, says the Silicon Valley-style pay package was created to promote the growth and risk-return mindset found among executives at entrepreneurial companies. While many tech entrepreneurs aim to get rich by selling their companies, he and co-founders Gentz and Schneider say they’re pursuing a different route. “Jeff Bezos hasn’t called, and Jack Ma hasn’t, either,” says the 37-year-old Ritter, referring to the CEO of Amazon.com Inc. and the Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. chairman. “We’re not building the company with the purpose of getting acquired.”The co-CEOs have pledged to triple the value of clothes sold on Zalando’s platform to match the sales of Hennes & Mauritz AB, the Swedish apparel chain whose H&M stores anchor shopping strips from Boston to Beijing. Yet the German company wants to reach that goal without going outside economically stagnant Europe, bypassing the world’s biggest e-commerce markets: the U.S. and China.The strategy sounds contrarian at a time when Amazon and China’s Alibaba are expanding in fashion, with the U.S. giant pushing aggressively onto Zalando’s European turf. While internet companies such as Google and Facebook Inc. benefit from their global reach, Ritter figures it’s better for e-commerce sites to focus regionally. Even Amazon has ceded China to Alibaba and rivals including JD.com Inc. “Europe is big enough to build a €20 billion fashion company,” says Ritter, sporting the backpack, sneakers, and jeans favored by Berlin’s new breed of tech entrepreneurs. Large brands “want to build their next store on the street with the most traffic, and Zalando is the street with the most traffic they’ve ever seen.”The company has marked its ambitions with a new headquarters near the East Side Gallery, a mural-covered remnant of the Berlin Wall. The complex has many of the trappings of California tech titans’ campuses, including a kindergarten, a yoga studio, and a rooftop basketball court.Zalando, which grew popular in Germany with the help of TV spots featuring female shoppers screaming with joy when a postman delivers the company’s packages, already sells €5 billion a year worth of apparel from Adidas, Nike, Hugo Boss, and others in 17 countries, processing an average of 370,000 orders each day.The company is expanding its Amazon Prime-like Plus program, which includes personalized style advice, and looking to extend its reach into more countries in Eastern Europe, Ritter says. He also hopes to cut down on costly returns—half of sales are sent back—by using data on sizes and customer preferences more effectively.To boost sales in its current markets, Zalando aims to increase its lineup of big brands by expanding a program that lets them build their own virtual stores on the platform, with control over inventory, images, and pricing. Zalando gets a commission from those sales, which are less profitable for the company than those of its own retail operation, where it buys clothes in bulk from suppliers and sells them through its online shop. The company is betting it can boost profits by selling fulfillment and other support services to more partners.The co-CEOs will reap the full payout only if Zalando has annual average sales growth of more than 15 percent for the next five years and the share price more than triples, to €144.58. That could turn out to be a high bar. In the third quarter of 2018, Zalando’s growth was the slowest since it went public in 2014, though it’s since picked up. Meanwhile, local online fashion rivals are mushrooming, including Otto Group’s AboutYou, a Zalando clone.Germany’s tradition of worker representation on boards probably means Zalando-style packages are unlikely to spread quickly through the country’s biggest companies. There’s also a growing backlash against high CEO pay globally, with Abigail Disney, whose grandfather and great-uncle founded Walt Disney Co., recently calling CEO Bob Iger’s $65.6 million compensation package “insane.”Still, more German companies are linking long-term pay awards to share-price gains and taking other steps to reward performance. Members of executive boards—comprising the top managers of German companies, rather than outside advisers—earned 71 times the average pay of their workers in 2017, up from 42 times in 2005, according to the Hans Boeckler Stiftung, a research organization funded by Germany’s trade unions. The Zalando executives’ deal is just the most extreme example of this trend. “It’s a remarkable compensation package for Germany,” says Hans-Joachim Boecking, a business professor at the Goethe University Frankfurt. “You can see the ground shifting.” —With Anders Melin'),\n",

       "  '2019-04-14',\n",
       "  \"Breaking down the boldest best in business.Wegmans Food Market, a privately held chain of 98 stores in six states, is not your average grocer. As detailed in our deep-dive this week, it is second only to Whole Foods in supermarket sales per square foot and was early to some strategies that have become best practices in the sector, namely churning out high-profit margins from in-house brands and prepared foods.It also delivers on a tired but effective retail mantra: surprise and delight. The Wegmans empire is full of things a first-timer may not expect, including cheese “caves,” exotic snack foods and counters where employees prep produce for lazy cooks. One store just west of Boston has a tequila bar. It’s all an exercise in refining the experience of shopping. Indeed, “UX” is mentioned as frequently among savvy retailers these days as it is at a coding bootcamp. Much of retail has focused on making that shopping experience frictionless (see Amazon’s checkout-free stores), but Wegmans has gone entirely the other way.It takes some work to shop at Wegmans—more so than the average supermarket, where the pattern of goods is fixed from produce to packages to ice cream. At Wegmans, first you have to figure out the vast array of what's actually stocked in the sprawling stores and then make mental notes on how to find the same goods again—like Pokémon but with pomegranates and fresh-rolled sushi. Here’s Food & Wine’s take from 2017: “Wegmans is essentially perfect — but only after you learn to shop there.” Once you put in the work, you're in the club, and you're more likely to crow about it. It’s a level of cultish loyalty typically reserved for obscure indie bands and foreign-language dramas on Netflix.T.J. Maxx wrote the playbook on this dynamic with its “treasure hunt” strategy. In the process, it cultivated “Maxxinistas,” a distant cousin of the “Wegmaniac.” At the Coach flagship, those who order a bag these days can sit around and watch it being made — cutting-edge retail circa 2019 and 1619, for that matter. Frictionless commerce is still a good idea – the future, in fact. But the folks who subscribe to it are already getting their groceries delivered. They aren’t coming back to the store anyway, unless, of course, they fancy a margarita.\"),\n",

       "  '2019-04-14',\n",
       "  \"A sale of Universal would net billions for Vivendi and its No. 1 shareholder, Vincent Bolloré.Lady Gaga at the Grammy Awards. The past year has been unusually harsh for French billionaire Vincent Bolloré. The former chairman of media giant Vivendi SA was implicated in a bribery scandal in Africa, his electric car-sharing program in Paris shut down, and he’s losing a battle for control of Telecom Italia—the troubled carrier at the heart of his plan to create a southern European entertainment juggernaut. He dodged a bullet at Vivendi’s annual meeting on April 15, after investors narrowly approved a measure that can allow his group to increase control over the company.Despite the setbacks, help is on the way—from Taylor Swift, Lady Gaga, and U2. Vivendi is planning to sell a 49 percent stake in Universal Music Group, the world’s biggest recording house. The sale could bring in more than $15 billion for Vivendi and send its stock soaring, analysts say—a payout that would deliver billions to Bolloré’s holding company, Vivendi’s No. 1 stockholder.Over the past four decades, the 67-year-old financier has transformed a family-owned paper manufacturer in Brittany into a takeover machine with holdings in industries that range from ports and advertising to media and battery technology. Along the way, the urbane tycoon established a web of interlocking, publicly traded companies and became known as “le Smiling Killer” in French financial circles.Yet in contrast to today’s shareholder activists, who shake up companies for the benefit of hedge fund clients, Bolloré is an old-school corporate raider driven by a more elemental ambition: building a dynasty. In recent years he’s placed his children in key positions at his companies while amassing a family fortune in excess of $5 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. “Bolloré is very proud of his history, and he’s convinced himself that he can use all the resources of capitalism to consolidate his patrimoine familial, his family’s wealth and legacy,” says Maurice Levy, chairman of the supervisory board at Publicis Groupe, the Paris advertising giant. “Sometimes he’s had to behave like a corsair.”Like a good pirate, Bolloré prefers to sneak up on his targets. In 2012 he acquired a 4.4 percent stake in Vivendi, a company founded in the 19th century as a water provider for French cities that had morphed into a global media conglomerate. As Bolloré built his stake—today he owns more than a quarter of Vivendi—he started pushing for a shakeup and took control of the board.That yielded the asset that’s shaping up to be Bolloré’s salvation. Universal is home to many of the hottest names in the music business and has deep song catalogs from the likes of the Rolling Stones and Bob Marley. Though the music industry suffered mightily as the internet destroyed CD sales, revenue has rebounded since 2014 thanks to paid streaming platforms such as Spotify and Apple Music.Morgan Stanley analyst Omar Sheikh says Universal is worth $30 billion, making it Vivendi’s most valuable business by far. (Its Telecom Italia stake is valued at $2.1 billion.) Sheikh speculates that Vivendi might choose to auction off a majority stake or even sell the whole company, which could send Vivendi’s stock price up by two-thirds, netting €5.5 billion ($6.2 billion) for holding company Bolloré SA. The tycoon “would probably accept an offer for control if he felt the value was high enough,” Sheikh wrote in a March report.A lucrative deal for Universal would take much of the sting out of Bolloré’s annus horribilis, which unfolded last April when French authorities charged him with corruption and forgery in connection with an African bribery case. Investigators suspect that his companies offered campaign services to politicians in Guinea and Togo in exchange for contracts at ports in those countries. Bolloré denies the allegations, but with charges looming he resigned as chairman of Vivendi a year ago and was succeeded by his 39-year-old son, Yannick. Bolloré declined to comment for this article.Two months later came the day of reckoning for Autolib, Bolloré’s electric car-sharing service. With its silver-colored subcompacts humming through Paris since 2011, the venture had been a publicity bonanza for Blue Solutions, a manufacturer of electric vehicles and batteries controlled by Bolloré. But as Autolib struggled with debt, Bolloré asked the municipality for millions to keep the cars running. No deal, said officials, who pulled the plug five years before Autolib’s contract was due to expire.In Milan, Bolloré is battling to maintain his hold on Telecom Italia, the onetime state-owned telephone monopoly. Vivendi owns almost a quarter of the carrier’s shares, and Bolloré had planned to create a conglomerate in the mold of Walt Disney Co., steering Vivendi’s content—from Universal and Studiocanal, Europe’s top producer of movies and TV shows—onto Telecom Italia’s networks.To extend its reach in Italy, Vivendi acquired 29 percent of Mediaset SpA, the broadcaster founded by Silvio Berlusconi. The relationship broke down when Vivendi abruptly canceled its purchase of Mediaset’s pay-TV unit, landing the two in court. And as Telecom Italia struggles under its €26 billion in debt, investors have dumped shares: Its market value has dropped by about half since Bolloré started consolidating control of the company in 2015.Those troubles set up a brawl with Paul Singer, the New York hedge fund manager whose Elliott Management Corp. has acquired almost 10 percent of Telecom Italia with an eye toward spinning off its fading landline business. Elliott has said Vivendi’s “poor stewardship” has resulted in “deeply troubling corporate governance issues” at Telecom Italia and no clear strategic plan. Elliott has wrested control of the carrier’s board from Bolloré, and shortly before the company’s annual meeting in March, Vivendi abruptly withdrew its candidates for director because there was virtually no chance they would win. The episode shows that Bolloré’s idea of creating a next-generation media giant with an old-guard company was flawed, says Carlo Alberto Carnevale Maffe, a professor at Bocconi School of Management in Milan. “It was an industrial strategy based on yesterday’s technology,” Maffe says.The difficulties have accelerated Bolloré’s handover of power to his children. Bolloré stepped down from Vivendi’s board on April 15, although he will still advise Arnaud de Puyfontaine, the chief executive officer of the media conglomerate. Bollore's 33-year-old son Cyrille has now joined Vivendi's board and he is also set to replace his father as chairman and chief executive officer of Bolloré SA. Marie, 30, has been the head of the Blue Solutions auto venture since 2017. The eldest, Sebastien, 41, sits on the boards of several companies, including Gameloft, a video-game maker owned by Vivendi. “Bolloré’s primary intention is to make sure he manages to grab even more control to ensure his family legacy,” says Pierre-Yves Gauthier, CEO of equity research company AlphaValue. “Shareholders should be aware of this.”It’s unclear how the management dynamics will change, and Bolloré is tight-lipped when it comes to the inner workings of his companies. But the tycoon will still wield real power via his controlling interest in Financière de l’Odet, a holding company that’s Bolloré SA’s biggest shareholder. “He’s had a lot of ups and downs,” says advertising boss Levy. “But he always manages to rebound.”\"),\n",

       "  'WhoopsPHOTOGRAPHER: GETTY IMAGESA momentary 83 percent plunge and rebound in one of Singapore’s largest stocks, Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd., left dazed traders wondering whether a “fat finger” had struck again in January. After the dust settled, Singapore Exchange Ltd. decided not to cancel the trades, insisting neither human error nor a computer malfunction was to blame. Still, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were said to have sought to cancel or amend their trades later, indicating mistakes were made somewhere. The episode serves as a reminder that even the best-designed systems can behave unexpectedly once humans enter the equation.For the origin of the phrase, imagine someone entering a trade and pressing the button next to the one he or she meant to on the keyboard -- literally because his or her finger was too big -- and you get the idea. It’s become a colloquialism that refers generally to human error, either a literal typing error or a more figurative mistake. As many financial institutions have discovered over the years, an extra zero here or there can make a huge difference.A fat finger was suspected when Jardine Matheson shares plunged 83% in SingaporeSource: Bloomberg, Singapore ExchangeIn many cases, yes. Deutsche Bank AG accidentally transferred 28 billion euros ($32 billion) -- far more than was due -- to an outside account as part of its daily derivative dealings, Bloomberg first reported in April 2018. The money landed at Deutsche Boerse AG’s Eurex clearinghouse, but was quickly returned. Volume in Walt Disney Co. appeared to surge for a moment in February 2015 when more than 131 million shares seemed to trade at once on the New York Stock Exchange -- a transaction so big only one shareholder probably could have placed it. But it turned out it never happened, as the initial trade order was quickly cut to a much less magical 1.3166 million.Not necessarily. Someone at Samsung Securities Co., one of South Korea’s largest brokerages, was trying to pay employees 1,000 won (88 cents) per share in dividends under a company compensation plan in April 2018, but gave them 1,000 shares instead. That totaled about $105 billion, or more than 30 times the company’s market value. Things got worse when 16 employees sold the stock, sparking a rout in the share price. In December 2015, Mizuho Securities Co. in Japan mistakenly offered to sell 610,000 shares of employment agency J-Com Co. for 1 yen each (1 cent), instead of selling one share for the market price of 610,000 yen ($5,530), something the firm blamed on a typing error. Then problems with the Tokyo Stock Exchange’s computer system prevented the brokerage from canceling the sell order -- which cost it $345 million. Japan’s Financial Services Agency subsequently ordered Mizuho to improve its compliance and systems, as well as train staff better.Even the best-laid plans and systems can’t account for human fallibility. Take cybersecurity. Germany’s chief financial regulator noted in March that the vast majority of computer security problems at banks are caused by “internal mishaps or mistakes or procedural problems,” rather than external forces such as criminal hackers. This has real-world consequences as regulators order banks with poor computer systems to hold more capital.Considering there are hundreds of markets around the world processing trillions of transactions at lightning speeds every day, not that often. Which is why when mistakes occur, the impact is so noticeable and embarrassing, as these examples show:Did a trader mean to execute a trade 100 times the typical size?Source: Comex, Bloomberg (Hong Kong time)Gold traders were rattled in June 2017 by a huge spike in volume in New York futures when trading jumped to 1.8 million ounces of gold in just a minute, an amount bigger than the gold reserves of Finland. Gold futures fell as much as 1.6 percent. One possible explanation: A mistaken trade of 18,149 lots of a futures contract, about 100 times the size of a typical trade of 18,149 ounces.In October 2014, someone placed more than 40 erroneous orders totaling 67.8 trillion yen on Japan’s over-the-counter market -- greater than the size of Sweden’s economy at the time. The attempted transactions included a bid to buy 57 percent of Toyota Motor Corp.’s outstanding shares and other big stakes in Japanese blue chips including Honda Motor, Canon, Sony and Nomura Holdings. The orders were canceled before they were executed.Confusion swept across trading desks in August 2013 as prices for equity derivatives swung without reason, with some contracts trading for $26 one minute and $1 the next. The culprit was Goldman Sachs, which experienced software errors causing it to spew unintentional orders from the first moments of trading, according to a person briefed on the matter.UBS Group AG said its Japanese unit mistakenly ordered 3 trillion yen of Capcom Co. convertible bonds in February 2009, almost $31 billion at the time. That was 100,000 times more than it intended, according to the bank, which cited an internal system error.

       "  'After the New Zealand massacre, will governments begin to regulate how social media oversees content?Evil travels freely on the internet. It flickers before us in plain sight. Yet, despite the livestreamed horror of March 15 in Christchurch, New Zealand, enacting social media reforms will take massive efforts in regulation, requiring the cooperation of the tech giants, governments, and consumers.In a perfect world, YouTube’s and Facebook’s algorithms would race through a video as soon as someone tries to upload it. If the machines recognize troubling content or a video that’s already been banned, the images would never reach the public.So what happened in New Zealand? Alleged gunman Brenton Tarrant had an audience of only about 200 people during the 17 minutes he broadcast his attack on the Al Noor mosque in Christchurch. Yet, though Facebook Inc. took the video off Tarrant’s page 12 minutes after the livestream ended, hundreds of thousands of clones of the footage were produced and circulated on the internet. The video was reposted on Twitter, where it auto-played on the timelines of unsuspecting users; it appeared in Reddit’s infamous “Watch People Die” forum, which is exactly what its name says it is; and, of course, it showed up on YouTube, the world’s leading video-hosting site. Facebook managed to stop 1.2 million copies from circulating on its site—but 300,000 still got through. At its peak, the video was uploaded once per second, YouTube Chief Product Officer Neal Mohan told the Washington Post.Google’s and YouTube’s AI censors work well for videos they’ve had time to “learn” to recognize, such as previously collected terrorist propaganda or child pornography cataloged by police officers. To a certain extent, the algorithms may spot permutations of that footage. They still struggle, however, with what’s going on in clips they’ve never seen, according to Rasty Turek, chief executive officer of Pex, a startup that helps companies identify videos infringing on copyright. Even if the platforms identify fresh material as objectionable, the people who post it can use simple tricks like changing the size of the clip, speeding it up or slowing it down, or simply flipping it on its side to fool the algorithms.Google and Facebook have spent years trying to find ways to stop problematic videos from appearing on their websites. YouTube’s Content ID tool, which has been around for more than a decade, gives copyright owners such as film studios the ability to claim content as their own, get paid for it, and have bootlegged copies deleted. Similar technology has been used to identify illegal or undesirable content. But when a new video circulates, it can be copied, altered in a minor way, and re-uploaded, slipping past the censors. “It’s whack-a-mole,” Turek says. “People are genius at these things. They will figure out how to get something past it.”At congressional hearings in the U.S. over the past two years, executives from Facebook and YouTube said they were investing heavily in artificial intelligence that would be able to find and block violent and graphic videos before anyone saw them. But if all you have is a split second, how do you distinguish fact from fiction, and freedom of expression from murderous reality? Getting from AI’s idealistic intentions “to understanding the context of a video is like a frog understanding a grocery store,” Turek says.By the point in the livestream when Tarrant left his car and entered the mosque, it was too late to save lives. But could social media platforms have stopped him long before that? Perhaps, if they’d recognized the warning signs in Tarrant’s online behavior. Two days before the assault, he posted multiple photographs on Twitter of assault-style firearms and ammunition, marked with telltale writing. Among the inscriptions were the names of accused mass murderers: Alexandre Bissonnette, convicted of killing six Muslims at a mosque in Canada; Luca Traini, a neo-Nazi convicted of shooting six African immigrants in Italy; and Josué Estébanez, who killed a teenager who was protesting fascism in Spain. Tarrant made multiple mentions of “14,” a reference to the 14-word-long white supremacist slogan. Also on view was a bulletproof vest covered with symbols commonly used by neo-Nazis: a Celtic cross and the black sun—or Sonnenrad—patch.Even before posting photos of his weapons, Tarrant spent weeks tweeting out racist videos, calling immigrants “invaders,” and claiming white people were being subjected to genocide. He also posted a link to an 87-page manifesto to Twitter hours before the shooting. None of this behavior raised red flags at Twitter. His profile remained active until the murder spree in New Zealand.“Progressives would have a hard time squaring their love of freedom with shutting off access to things like YouTube or Facebook”Tarrant is an Australian citizen, but in the U.S., where Twitter is based, his tweets would have been largely protected by the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The rifle photos, however, could press against the boundary of inciting violence. “Putting the name of a mass shooter on your rifle is pretty much the same as yelling ‘fire’ in a crowded theater,” wrote Robert Evans, who reports about right-wing extremism for the online investigative journalism site Bellingcat. “If you’re posting pictures of your rifle with the names of other mass shooters on it, [Twitter] should look into where that guy is posting from and inform law enforcement.”Following the attack, Twitter removed Tarrant’s profile. By then, however, users on YouTube had already preserved it and uploaded videos that scrolled through his account, which included links to the manifesto. YouTube also became home to numerous re-uploaded versions of the original Facebook Live broadcast. Internet service providers in New Zealand took matters into their own hands, blocking a website popular with white supremacists where the video was spreading. “It’s an unprecedented action,” tweeted Jason Paris, CEO of Vodafone New Zealand Ltd., when questioned about whether the internet service provider was engaging in censorship. “However, terrorism won’t get any oxygen from Vodafone.”The world’s democracies have been reluctant to remove content from the web, though, fearful of mirroring the policies of more restrictive regimes, such as China. “While the intent may be to protect citizens from bad stuff, rather than to regulate or coerce, progressives would have a hard time squaring their love of freedom with shutting off access to things like YouTube or Facebook,” says Ari Ezra Waldman, a professor at New York Law School who studies technology regulation. Hate speech is banned in Australia—though penalties are relatively light, mostly resulting in apologies. But in New Zealand the Department of Internal Affairs declared that sharing the March 15 video was a crime. Legislators also quickly proposed a ban on semi-automatic rifles like those used in the attack. And, in the wake of the massacre, politicians have called for regulation of social media companies, which have been highly resistant to policing their own content.In the U.S., despite slews of congressional hearings, lawmakers have been reluctant to impose restrictions on technology companies. Some have tried to put together a federal online privacy bill, but to no avail. A bill that would have restricted online political advertising lost steam when its Republican sponsor, Arizona Senator John McCain, died. Congress did pass a law that makes online platforms bear some responsibility for activity on their sites—but limited it to sex trafficking.If the U.S. doesn’t find a way to regulate internet content and establish watchdogs, could the American tech giants be forced to do so by overseas pressure? The European Union has imposed fines on Google and others for antitrust issues. Last year it enacted the General Data Protection Regulation, which includes “the right to be forgotten,” requiring companies to delete data on any individual who asks them to. Data collectors also need to get consent from people before storing their information. Some U.S. companies have already complied with the European rules worldwide. Could the EU likewise force U.S. companies to increase management of the content that reaches its market of 500 million people? The scale of the undertaking might just make compliance universal.Immediately after news of the massacre broke, lawmakers in Europe were calling for regulation. “We’ve heard a lot today about taking back control,” Tom Watson, deputy leader of the U.K.’s Labour Party, said on the radio. “Well, today the big social media platforms lost control. They failed the victims of that terrorist atrocity. They failed to show any decency and responsibility. And we can’t go on like this. Today must be the day when good people commit to take back control from the wicked, ignorant oligarchs of Silicon Valley.” Sajid Javid, the U.K. home secretary, also expressed frustration with Facebook, Google, and Twitter for allowing extremist content. “Take some ownership,” he tweeted on March 15. “Enough is enough.”“At some point, we will have to regulate,” said Frans Timmermans, a Dutch politician who serves as the first vice president of the European Commission, at the World Policy Forum on March 18. “The first task of any public authority is to protect its citizens—and if we see you as a threat to our citizens, we will regulate. And if you don’t work with us, we will probably regulate badly.”The imagery that populated Tarrant’s posts would be difficult to find in Germany. After World War II the country banned the symbols of “unconstitutional organizations”: swastikas, the Aryan fist, the Iron Cross, and others. In 2017 it passed the Network Enforcement Act, which fines social media platforms that fail to remove illegal content, including hate speech, defamation, and calls for violence. “By far, the largest numbers of people who work to remove hateful comments for Facebook are Germans working in Germany, far more than there are in the U.S., even though the U.S. is a far larger country,” says Henry Fernandez, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress who studies the role of technology companies in radicalization. Europe is far more willing to regulate content online because of its history with fascism. “European interpretations of the importance of free speech are simply different,” says Waldman of New York Law School. “The cultural memory is very much tied to the horrors of World War II.”In February, Germany’s federal cartel office—which oversees antitrust issues—imposed “far-reaching restrictions” on the way Facebook and its WhatsApp and Instagram subsidiaries collect, combine, and deploy user data. The country’s policing of social media giants has caught the attention of EU regulators. “We study it with the same great interest because of the two legs, both that Facebook is a dominant player in this market but also how they interpret privacy rules,” EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager told Bloomberg in early February.Both Waldman and Fernandez believe European countries are more likely than the U.S. to regulate radical and violent content online. In New Zealand, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern focused on Facebook in front of Parliament on March 19,saying, “They are the publisher, not just the postman. There cannot be a case of all profit, no responsibility.” Still, in the U.S., threats to the bottom line are more effective than lobbying Congress to restrict platforms that promote white supremacy. Companies such as Procter & Gamble Co. or Walt Disney Co., which spend hundreds of millions of dollars a year on YouTube alone, have pulled ads when criminal or terrorist content popped up on the platform. “The companies are driven first and foremost by a profit motive,” Fernandez says. The algorithms they use “do not prioritize curbing hate online. Profit first.”That situation may change with a new generation of U.S. legislators. “As younger people are being elected,” Fernandez says, “they are engaging aggressively on social media as a way to communicate. I would anticipate they would then come with a different understanding of what regulation might look like over time.” The question is: What can social media companies do right now to prevent the next massacre?'),\n",

HBO is penciled in to serve as its backbone.How all the pieces will fit together is still largely a mystery. But whenever WarnerMedia’s streaming service does arrive, it will face a wildly competitive landscape. In addition to Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime Video, the media conglomerates Comcast and Disney are working on similar products. Apple is too.With the race for streaming riches careening forward at breakneck speed, AT&T is positioning HBO to serve as its engine for the future—never mind the network’s sputtering past on the web.\"),\n",

       "  'Richard Plepler, the gregarious and perpetually tanned head of Home Box Office Inc., had a saying: HBO is a media company, not a technology company. The statement grew more radical with each passing year as seemingly every other business—car manufacturers, cigarette makers, pizza chains—declared themselves technology companies.Under Plepler, who became co-president in 2007 and chief executive officer in 2013, HBO didn’t pretend to be a bootstrapping startup; it was a house of art, not science. The network cultivated the top creative minds in TV, racked up Emmys, threw killer cocktail parties, and generated billions of dollars in profit for its corporate parent, Time Warner.Then, on Feb. 28, what felt like one of the last cultural joyrides in the media business ended, as one might expect, in pools of corporate-acquisition bloodshed. Plepler, 60, announced in a memo to his staff that he was resigning. AT&T Inc., which had acquired Time Warner Inc. for $85.4 billion, had just beaten back one final antitrust challenge from the U.S. Department of Justice and was preparing to reorganize the assets of what’s now known as WarnerMedia LLC.Later this year, AT&T executives will introduce a streaming video service featuring WarnerMedia content, which includes brands such as TBS, TNT, and the Warner Bros. studio. HBO will play a crucial, if still uncertain, role as one of AT&T’s keys for unlocking digital fortunes.But interviews with more than a dozen former Time Warner and HBO employees, many of whom declined to be named discussing a former employer, suggest that maximizing HBO on the internet has long enchanted and frustrated the scores of executives who’ve tried. “HBO has been the ultimate Gordian knot,” says Jamyn Edis, a former vice president of HBO’s consumer technology group who’s now an adjunct professor at New York University’s Stern School of Business. “It’s been a seemingly intractable set of problems: long-term contracts written before the dawn of digital, 30-year-career executives with no incentive to hurt the Time Warner cash cow, an institutional distaste for technology—‘we’re in the content business’—and the internecine tribal warfare typical of any organization.”According to the legend of the Gordian knot, Alexander the Great solved the conundrum not by disentangling each snag, but by slicing through them with a sword. AT&T is swinging its blade at a time when Netflix, with 58 million paying U.S. customers, has far outpaced HBO, which has an estimated 8 million standalone streaming subscribers.On April 14 the eighth and final season of HBO’s Game of Thrones will return with its dragons and undead warriors. Until then, the only realms likely to see more upheaval will be AT&T’s newly conquered kingdoms, which will undergo a corporate rejiggering. Rather than witness the carnage likely under House Telco, Plepler abdicated his throne. (Through an HBO spokesperson, he declined to comment.) He’s left his supporters to grapple with an unsettling thought: What if the algorithmic data miners were right all along?Twenty years ago, as fear of the Y2K bug gripped the land, HBO hired a new chief information officer. Michael Gabriel, who’d worked at EMI, the giant music conglomerate, watched as Napster and other downloading services unleashed havoc on the industry. He asked Jeff Bewkes, then HBO’s CEO, how he wanted to deal with the upheaval when it eventually hit TV.Bewkes wanted HBO to be all in on the internet when the time was right, Gabriel says, but he didn’t want to spend too much money or be premature. HBO’s business model was reliant on relationships with cable- and satellite-distribution partners, who accounted for virtually all revenue. Gabriel assembled a team to experiment with the emerging technology of playing TV and movies on the internet. (Through a spokesperson, Bewkes declined to comment.)From the outside, people think of HBO for its innovative programming—The Sopranos, Sex and the City, The Wire, and, of course, Game of Thrones. But people who’ve worked there describe a hidebound institution. Decisions are made slowly and by consensus; longtime employees guard the network’s lucrative, award-winning status quo. From the start, HBO’s internet team was met with occasional outbursts of resistance. Gabriel recalls a manager meeting when a business-affairs executive unloaded. “He began vehemently shouting at me, ‘You’re going to destroy a $3 billion business,’\\u200a” Gabriel says. (The traditional business would be fine, growing to $6.6 billion in annual revenue and more than 130 million global cable and satellite subscribers by 2018.)In 2006, HBO began beta-testing HBO on Broadband, a service that let people watch its programming on their computer, with Time Warner Cable subscribers in Green Bay, Wis. Initial feedback was encouraging. At the time, Gabriel was keeping an eye on an emerging competitor. In February 2007, Netflix Inc., a data-minded company in California best-known for lending DVDs by mail, launched a service streaming movies and TV over the internet.An idea spread through HBO: What if Time Warner bought Netflix? It would be the perfect marriage of art and science and give Time Warner enormous leverage over the downstream markets for TV shows and movies. The concept made its way up the chain of command, where it was duly slain. HBO and Time Warner executives thought the roughly $1 billion to $1.5 billion it might cost would be better spent on programming. “There was a belief that Netflix was going to implode,” Gabriel says, “either due to the escalating costs with their model or due to content no longer being licensed to them.”By 2018, Netflix was generating $1.2 billion of annual net profit on $15.8 billion of revenue. Its current market value is $154 billion.HBO expanded its streaming service in 2010 to existing TV customers in the U.S. through a mobile and desktop service called HBO Go. Cable and satellite affiliates would handle headaches involving customer service, while the company would pay to program and maintain the apps.As Netflix began its hundredfold ascent in market value, it attracted reams of favorable press and industry observers began to see it as an existential threat to HBO. In a December 2010 New York Times interview, Bewkes, who by then was overseeing all of Time Warner as CEO, weighed in on his competitor. “It’s a little bit like, Is the Albanian army going to take over the world?” he said. “I don’t think so.”Inside HBO, however, there was growing acknowledgment that streaming products would be a vital part of the future. This led to skirmishes to claim control and credit for HBO Go. Otto Berkes, a relative newcomer to the network who’d spent much of his career at Microsoft Corp., won out.In December 2012, HBO named Berkes its next chief technology officer. Until that point, the implementation of the company’s internet strategy had relied on outside vendors for such things as designing user interfaces. Berkes told colleagues HBO would be better off developing and owning its own streaming technology and interfaces, as Netflix did. He wanted to create a platform that could stream not only HBO’s programming but also all of Time Warner’s.In addition to HBO, Time Warner owned Turner Broadcasting System Inc. (home to the Cartoon Network, CNN, TBS, TNT, and Turner Classic Movies) and Warner Bros. (Harry Potter and Teen Titans Go!, among many other franchises). Combining these entities into one streaming service was tantalizing. In theory, the brand managers should have worked together as part of the same conglomerate. But in practice, each property acted like an independent nation-state.Building a streaming platform from scratch was expensive. It could have cost hundreds of millions of dollars before any significant revenue began flowing in. While Berkes attempted to loosen the corporate purse strings, he began assembling a team of engineers and product designers inside a new HBO office in Seattle. In New York, key members of the internet team departed. In February 2013, Netflix premiered House of Cards, one of its first big forays into HBO-esque programming. “The goal is to become HBO faster than HBO can become us,” Ted Sarandos, Netflix’s chief content officer, told GQ.Sarandos didn’t need to worry. In April 2014, when fans logged on to HBO Go to watch the fourth season premiere of Game of Thrones, the service crashed; it continued to do so on successive Sunday nights. Howling subscribers inundated social media.While the tech team in Seattle worked to fix the problems, it wasn’t always on the same page with the businesspeople in New York. That spring, HBO licensed the network’s library to Amazon Prime Video, the giant retailer’s streaming service. For HBO it was a high-margin arrangement that would pad profits. (Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Youssef Squali estimated the deal would be worth $200 million to $400 million a year to HBO over a four-year period.) But the move didn’t sit well with some members of the tech team, who worked near Amazon.com Inc.’s Seattle headquarters and saw the company as a fierce competitor. Training people to go to Amazon Prime Video to watch classic HBO shows, they worried, could undermine the appeal of HBO’s own internet offerings.While questions remained about HBO’s long-term vision, short-term emergencies intervened. In June 2014, Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox Inc. made a surprise $80 billion bid for Time Warner. Bewkes rejected the offer, but it ratcheted up the pressure on him to wow Time Warner investors.That October he made his own unexpected announcement: HBO would soon unveil an internet subscription service for everyone—even consumers who didn’t subscribe to cable or satellite TV. As Plepler put it, “There are 80 million homes that do not have HBO, and we will use all means at our disposal to go after them.”The development of a direct-to-consumer product, which would eventually be named HBO Now (HBO Go would continue to serve paying cable and satellite customers), was under way in Seattle. But Bewkes’s announcement accelerated the timeline. Again, creating a technology platform would be expensive, mostly because doing so required disciplined, talented, and well-managed people working with unity of purpose—which fairly described the opposite of Time Warner culture. Former colleagues say Plepler and Berkes spoke different languages. Plepler was fluent in the vernacular of Hollywood; Berkes was more of a quant. Multiple sources say the relationship frayed. (Berkes declined to comment.)HBO executives started considering outside help. Shelley Brindle, an executive vice president on HBO’s domestic distribution and marketing team, had recently attended Google Zeitgeist, a conference in Scottsdale, Ariz. There she’d met Kenny Gersh, an executive with MLB Advanced Media, a Major League Baseball limited partnership that had become expert in streaming high-profile TV events. As it turned out, the same Sunday night in April when HBO Go melted down during the Game of Thrones premiere, MLB Advanced Media had successfully streamed World Wrestling Entertainment Inc.’s biggest event of the year, WrestleMania. In November, Plepler made the switch.A month later, news broke that HBO was yanking the plug on its internal direct-to-consumer streaming product and outsourcing the work to MLB Advanced Media. Berkes resigned.In March 2015, Plepler introduced HBO Now at an Apple Inc. press conference in San Francisco. For three months, the app would be available exclusively on Apple devices. The Game of Thrones season premiere went off without a hitch in April. By February 2016, about 800,000 subscribers were paying $14.99 a month for HBO Now. Finally, a reign of stability took root.It lasted about a year. With the market growing quickly, MLB Advanced Media spun off its streaming division to form a separate company called BamTech. Over the summer, Walt Disney Co. acquired a 33 percent stake for $1 billion. Suddenly, the digital future of Time Warner’s prized network depended on a service controlled by a chief rival.Enter House Telco. In October 2016, AT&T bid $85.4 billion for Time Warner. The telecom wanted to diversify its business to outmaneuver rivals Verizon Communications Inc. and Sprint Corp. And AT&T execs believed Time Warner’s entertainment assets, led by HBO, could help it take on Netflix. But first the company would have to move HBO off Disney’s property.For many months, HBO waited while the offer navigated regulatory shoals. The whole time, the role of CTO remained vacant. In summer 2018 the network closed out its deal with BamTech and repatriated its streaming service. These days, Netflix’s technology can make HBO’s apps look like portals to the Dark Ages. In “Bandersnatch,” a recent special episode of Black Mirror, Netflix watchers could tap on their screen to alter the narrative.After years of experimentation, HBO still doesn’t have much control over a key aspect of the direct-to-consumer streaming experience—the consumer. “We believe HBO Now has over 8 million subscribers today, however, the overwhelming majority are\\u2009…\\u2009via Amazon Prime, Hulu, etc., with a small fraction of subscribers truly direct-to-consumer,” writes Rich Greenfield, an analyst with BTIG LLC.On March 4, AT&T named Robert Greenblatt, former head of entertainment at Showtime and NBC, the chairman of WarnerMedia Entertainment. In that role, Greenblatt will oversee the company’s direct-to-consumer streaming service. Whenever that product is ready, it will enter a brutally competitive market. Two other major conglomerates, Disney and Comcast Corp., plan to release similar services to take on Netflix, Amazon, and Hulu. In an interview with Bloomberg News, Greenblatt said many details about how HBO and the other Turner and Warner Bros. assets would be combined into the mix had yet to be settled—the same challenge the network was working on in 2013. “It won’t be easy to coordinate it all,” he says. —With Gerry Smith and Lucas Shaw '),\n",

       "  'PHOTOGRAPHER: QIU YANG FOR BLOOMBERG BUSINESSWEEK; SET DESIGN: SARAH-JANE HOFFMANNAbout a decade ago, Hank and John Green, fraternal YouTube stars, founded VidCon, an annual convention in Anaheim, Calif., that celebrates online video auteurs and their screaming teenage fans. As YouTube’s cultural impact deepened, so did VidCon’s. A constellation of amateur creators grew into an industry, with VidCon providing a stage for them to promote themselves IRL. Walt Disney Co. and DreamWorks Animation LLC bought up pieces of the YouTube ecosystem, confident they could transform fandom into fortune.As VidCon matured, the Greens noticed a stir of creative energy in another corner of the web. The audience for their comedy podcast, Dear Hank & John, in which they offer listeners questionable advice, was growing faster than that for their chatty web videos. So they decided to create a VidCon equivalent. In December 2017 the Greens and a few collaborators threw the first PodCon. Months later they sold VidCon to Viacom Inc. for an undisclosed sum.PodCon reconvened at a Seattle conference center in January with more than 3,000 people in attendance. Some wore T-shirts with podcast logos, while others dressed as their favorite podcast characters. In between panels they swapped practical advice, like how to make sound effects (rocking the legs of an old wooden table mimics a creaking ship) or how to avoid an echo (record under a blanket). People scribbled podcast recommendations on a wall and took selfies with stars. In a dimly lit auditorium, a few hundred people watched Griffin McElroy edit his family’s podcast—another comedic “advicecast” called My Brother, My Brother and Me—as his keystrokes were magnified on a Jumbotron.Anyone who lived through the early days of the online video boom, when investment and hype outpaced profit, may have experienced some déjà vu—the same sense of exhilaration, the same thin financial rewards. “People are starting to realize it’s not super easy to make money in this world,” Hank Green says.Even so, Hollywood and Silicon Valley are once again lining up to give it a try. Shortly after PodCon, Spotify Technology SA, owner of the world’s most popular paid music streaming service, made the largest deal yet in the space. In a filing it said it had paid $340 million for podcast company Gimlet Media Inc. and Anchor FM Inc., an app and web tool that helps podcasters record and distribute their work. (It was widely reported that it spent $230 million on Gimlet and $110 million on Anchor.) By investing in the medium, Spotify becomes less reliant on music, which requires paying royalties to labels.The company plans to spend as much as $500 million on podcast deals this year, a big bet that profits will eventually match enthusiasm. “Audio is only one-tenth of the size of the video market,” Chief Executive Officer Daniel Ek said on a February earnings call. “There is a massive opportunity here for audio to evolve into a more personalized, more immersive experience, much like how the video industry has evolved.”There are more than 600,000 podcasts in Apple Inc.’s service, about double the number from three years ago. The top ones attract audiences rivaling those of cable-TV shows, but the vast majority reach few listeners and make no money. The median audience for a podcast is about 130 people, according to hosting site Libsyn.The competition for attention is growing fierce, though. Newer podcasters are paying for studio time, upgrading equipment, and hiring artists to design logos that stand out in Apple’s podcast app. “There’s a much more savvy sensibility among creators,” says Gina Delvac, who produces Call Your Girlfriend, in which two friends talk about pop culture and politics. “You have to have that professional gloss to get any amount of attention.”The most popular offerings are a mix from podcasting companies (Gimlet, Wondery Inc.), individuals (The Joe Rogan Experience, WTF With Marc Maron), traditional media (the New York Times, Slate), and radio giants (WNYC, IHeart). NPR is the largest podcaster, with 46 shows reaching more than 19 million U.S. listeners a month. Oprah Winfrey, Conan O’Brien, and Mike Tyson are podcasters.About 73 million Americans listen to podcasts monthly, up from 42 million in 2014, according to Edison Research. Industry revenue, though minuscule compared with that of radio, TV, movies, or books, almost doubled from 2016 to 2017, to $313 million. (For context, that’s about how much revenue BuzzFeed Inc. alone generated in 2018.) That figure is expected to double again by 2020, according to the Interactive Advertising Bureau and PwC. Several top podcasts make more than $1 million a year. Last year The Daily, from the New York Times, cleared more than $10 million in advertising.There are several lines of thinking about how to close the enthusiasm-revenue gap. One focuses on the programming logjam, which can make choosing something to listen to a frustrating experience. Several startup websites and apps, including Piqd, Listen Notes, and Podchaser, are trying to match listeners with lesser-known shows. Larger platforms such as Spotify and internet-radio giant Pandora Media Inc., which honed this functionality in music, are now applying it to podcasts.The industry is also striving to broaden the market. Some fear that podcasting has become a community talking to itself—a coastal thing, like electric scooters and avocado toast, which may soon reach saturation. “It’s less exciting when it’s the sixth football podcast or the third comedian with a podcast talking to his L.A. comedy buddies,” says Amanda McLoughlin, co-host of Spirits, which describes itself as “a boozy dive into mythology, folklore, and urban legends.”Courting the millions of Americans who’ve heard of podcasts but don’t listen will mean diversifying their subject matter. After the success of Serial, produced by This American Life in 2014, which began with an investigation of an old murder case in Baltimore, true-crime podcasts became as ubiquitous as TV police procedurals. While the genre is popular, the macabre material can be off-putting to many potential listeners. Tom Webster, a senior vice president at Edison Research, wrote in an August essay posted on Medium that the industry has to get out of its bubbles “and understand the real bottle\\xadnecks to the growth of podcasting.”These bubbles are demographic inefficiencies that traditional media—which has spent decades designing TV series, magazines, and radio shows to amass niche audiences—should be well-suited to address. Everyone from radio syndication heavyweights such as Westwood One LLC (The Mark Levin Show, American Country Countdown) to supermarket publishers like American Media Inc. (Us Weekly, Soap Opera Digest) have rolled out podcast ventures.The advertising model will have to evolve, too. Early on there was no easy way to insert an ad break into a podcast. Creators haggled for deals directly with sponsors and read commercials themselves. When Marc Maron started WTF in 2009, his first advertiser was Just Coffee Cooperative; his declaration that the brew is so strong “I just shit my pants” soon became a catchphrase. (While the canned ads are a popular vestige of podcasting’s early days, they’re perhaps less palatable to big advertisers accustomed to mass-produced spots.)Companies such as Panoply Media LLC sell software to automate the advertising process and target listeners, while businesses such as Stitcher act like traditional media-\\xadbuying agencies, connecting hosts with brands hoping to reach a particular demographic. Owned by media conglomerate E.W. Scripps Co., Stitcher sells ads for more than 250 shows and pays out millions to podcasters each year. Ad brokers sell commercials for $25 to $50 per 1,000 downloads (an episode usually has two or three breaks). The money adds up—a top show like Freakonomics Radio averages more than 1.5 million downloads per episode.Larger advertisers haven’t fully embraced the medium, but they’re interested. Procter & Gamble Co., maker of Crest toothpaste and Oral-B toothbrushes, recently spent some of its world-leading ad budget on Chompers, a series produced by Gimlet. Kids can ask Amazon’s Alexa to play the two-\\xadminute episodes and take trivia quizzes while brushing their teeth. Chompers is also available as a twice-daily podcast you can download on any platform.One of the reasons there aren’t more Procter & Gambles on board is that the medium’s best consumption metric is the inexact one of downloads. Who hasn’t downloaded a podcast and then forgotten about it or immediately deleted it? Apple, the dominant listening platform, has its app on every iPhone, but it doesn’t share as much data as it could, making it hard for a podcaster to access major ad budgets.Many podcasters supplement ad revenue with live tours. The night before PodCon, Welcome to Night Vale, a popular podcast about a fictional desert community where bizarre things happen, performed at the Neptune Theatre in Seattle. Tickets were $30. The sales for the two sold-out shows at the 800-person auditorium amounted to roughly $50,000. Over the next several weeks, Night Vale did more than 20 shows from Berlin and London to Austin and Phoenix. Co-writer Jeffrey Cranor says the show averages about 400,000 downloads an episode, but it makes more money from touring and finds it a more reliable business. “Advertisers are fickle,” he says.Several companies are betting that fans will pay subscription fees for exclusive content. For $4.99 a month, the Stitcher Premium app offers subscribers exclusive podcasts, including a fictional show about the character Wolverine, which is co-produced with Marvel. Luminary will also offer exclusivity when it starts later this year. In 2018, Spotify paid \\xadcomedian Amy Schumer more than $1 million for the rights to her podcast, 3 Girls, 1 Keith, which will become part of the content buffet available to paying Spotify customers; during the quarter ended Dec. 31, it offered subscribers 14 other exclusive shows. For now, most Gimlet podcasts are universally available, but in the future more may be placed behind Spotify’s paywall.Gimlet sees Hollywood as another income source; Matt Lieber, who co-founded the company with Alex Blumberg, says it wants to be “the HBO of audio.” The five-year-old business, which produces 24 podcasts, has a staff of 120 in a Brooklyn office designed by the architect who created studios for Jimi Hendrix and the Boston Symphony Orchestra. The company recently scored a hit with Homecoming, a psychological thriller Amazon.com Inc. adapted for TV starring Julia Roberts. An episode of Gimlet’s most popular podcast, Reply All, which mines internet culture, is being made into a movie. Directed by Richard Linklater and starring Robert Downey Jr., the film is about a con artist and an editor who tries to expose him.Lieber says Gimlet wants to be both the Marvel and Bloomsbury of audio, with storytellers cooking up the superheroes and villains of Hollywood’s future. “It’s just as likely that the next Michael Crichton or J.K. Rowling will be a podcaster,” he says.Oren Rosenbaum is an agent with United Talent Agency, which has about 50 podcast-focused clients, including Ira Glass; Guy Raz, a co-host of several NPR podcasts; and Karen Kilgariff and Georgia Hardstark, co-hosts of My Favorite Murder. “We’re thinking about the economic deal terms,” Rosenbaum says, declining to elaborate on them. “How much can we get guaranteed? What are the revenue shares we can expect?”About 50 percent to 70 percent of all podcast listening is done via the Apple podcast app and iTunes. Getting featured in the New & Noteworthy section can bring a new entrant a horde of listeners. Yet despite its centrality to the industry, the roughly $800 billion company hasn’t devoted many resources to it. For years a single employee, Steve Wilson, was the contact for anyone seeking promotion.Others sense opportunity. In addition to Spotify, there’s Google, which last summer started a podcast app for Android users and has begun including podcasts in search results. Last fall, Pandora introduced the Podcast Genome Project, which uses an algorithm to make recommendations. Recently, Audible, Amazon’s audiobook company, has made forays into podcasting.If Apple wants to hold its position, it might take a page from YouTube’s playbook. In the early days of online video, it was laissez-faire toward the creative community. Over time, however, as Facebook and Amazon’s Twitch tried to lure away creatives, YouTube embraced the culture. It signed deals with high-profile YouTubers and built lavish studios where producers got free resources to improve their craft. Spotify’s purchase of Gimlet signals that a similar fight for the podcast community is taking shape. “For publishers, it’s about who do you play with now,” says Nick Quah, who writes the industry newsletter Hot Pod.If online video offers ideas for nurturing a scene, it also presents warnings. Boosters used to make big predictions about video, too: Monetization would catch up with fan enthusiasm, Hollywood money would flow in, paying subscriptions would skyrocket. A half-decade later, the business model is still in flux. At the peak of the frenzy in 2014, Disney bought Maker Studios, which created and aggregated short-form videos, ultimately paying $675 million for it. For a moment, Maker was key to Disney’s future. Then it wasn’t. By 2017 it was laying off large portions of its staff. Podcasting has already faced similar doses of reality. Last year, a few dozen employees involved in podcasts left Audible, Buzzfeed, and Panoply through layoffs or restructuring.Much will depend on Apple. The company declined to comment for this article, but there are hints that it’s being more proactive. Last year some of its employees flew to Los Angeles to meet with “Dr. Phil” McGraw, the celebrity psychologist, who’d decided to start a podcast. McGraw says the reps gave him a crash course in the basics. They told him to keep each episode to about 45 minutes so fans could listen to half on their way to work and half on their way home. They told him the importance of a good microphone and a quiet room. “They give you an awful lot of information you just wouldn’t know otherwise,” McGraw says.On a recent episode of his TV show, he explained to viewers how they could listen to his podcast, Phil in the Blanks, in which he interviews celebrities. A screen behind him displayed a giant iPhone. “On your phone or iPad, you click on this purple icon,” he said. “It has the word ‘podcast’ under it.”McGraw says he plans to do a true-crime podcast next.

       "  '2019-02-14',\n",
       "  'Unlike their dad, they won’t be building traditional media empires.From left: James, Elisabeth, Rupert, and Lachlan Murdoch in 2007.For several decades, the media industry watched slack-jawed as Rupert Murdoch acquired newspapers, magazines, TV channels, book imprints, movie rights, satellite assets, websites, and social networks. He bought from old-money, aristocratic families on the decline and from startup hipsters on the rise. Whether the media market was hot or frigid, Murdoch kept right on buying in spite of howling opposition from his progressive detractors.Then, finally, he sold. In June 2018, Walt Disney Co. agreed to pay $71 billion to acquire much of the sweeping territory Murdoch spent a lifetime assembling. Among other assets, Disney is poised to take control of 21st Century Fox Inc.’s TV and movie studios, its slate of cable-TV networks, including FX and National Geographic, and its stake in satellite-TV network Star India. The deal, which is navigating one of the final regulatory obstacles in Brazil, is expected to close this spring. When it does, the Murdoch clan, via its Nevada-based family trust, will likely net a mix of cash and Disney shares worth as much as $11.6 billion.For years, everyone in the industry loved to debate which of Murdoch’s three adult children from his second marriage—James, Lachlan, or Elisabeth—would ultimately assume the throne of their father’s vast empire. While the huge Disney sale has put to bed that question for a simple reason—instead of a globe-girdling empire, the Murdoch heirs are about to inherit a war chest—it also raises a new one: What will they do with all that money?Much attention will be focused on Lachlan, 47. When the deal with Disney closes, Rupert’s elder son will take over as the chairman and chief executive officer of the new Fox Corp., overseeing a company that will be roughly a third of its previous size. Its portfolio will be largely rooted in current-events TV programming in the U.S. via Fox News, Fox Broadcasting, and Fox Sports. It’s unlikely to stay small, however.“We will buy other things,” Lachlan said in November during an appearance at a conference hosted by the New York Times. “We will be acquisitive.” Through spokespersons, members of the family declined to be interviewed for this story. Recent moves, however, hint at the possible direction of things to come.Lately, 21st Century Fox has been stockpiling the rights to high-profile live events. In January 2018 the company signed a deal for roughly $3.3 billion to take over the broadcast rights for the NFL’s Thursday Night Football games through 2022. A couple months later, Fox scooped up the rights to World Wrestling Entertainment Inc.’s popular SmackDown broadcasts, paying about $1 billion for the five-year deal.In September, 21st Century Fox invested $100 million in Caffeine, a livestreaming platform reminiscent of Amazon’s Twitch. At the same time, Fox Sports announced a joint venture, Caffeine Studios, that will develop exclusive live entertainment content, including esports competitions. “We’re excited to partner with Caffeine and build something special for fans in the growing live social streaming esports and gaming space,” Lachlan said at the time. He now sits on Caffeine’s board.“They’ve been ahead of everyone else in terms of this bifurcation in media between live and on-demand,” says Geetha Ranganathan, a media analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. “The prices of content have risen so astronomically thanks to Netflix and Amazon. New Fox will be still spending boatloads of money, but at least they will be spending it on noncommodities. They’re riding the ‘live’ wave.”While Lachlan will be bolstering an existing portfolio of businesses, his younger brother, James, 46, is likely to be buying and investing with a clean slate. When the sale was first announced, there was speculation that James, the current CEO of 21st Century Fox, could take a top job at Disney. Instead, analysts expect James to strike out on his own, setting up an investment company that will acquire or back companies, possibly focused on such areas as streaming TV or environment-related missions. Analysts say they wouldn’t be surprised if he also looks for opportunities in markets overseas such as India, where he’s had success in the past.So far during his career, James has avoided the calamities that marked his father’s boldest forays into tech (think Myspace). Thanks to James’s foresight, the Murdochs became an early major investor in Roku, the streaming media company now valued at more than $5.4 billion. “My suspicion is that James is going to be putting all his efforts into becoming one of the world’s leading tech investors,” says Claire Enders, founder of London-based media researcher Enders Analysis. “He’s very much into that milieu of super rich, super successful tech investors who care a lot about the environment.”James should have good access to capital and deal flow in Silicon Valley. He sits on the board of Tesla Inc. alongside the likes of Oracle Corp. Chairman Larry Ellison, and has built an extensive network in the media and tech worlds on both sides of the Atlantic. “Many of the people he worked with at Sky are so wealthy that they’ll never have to work again,” Enders says. “They’ll be available to help him and invest with him as well.”When the deal closes, Elisabeth, 50, will also be empowered to step up her spending. In 2011 she sold Shine Group, a production company specializing in reality TV, to her father’s business for some $670 million. Afterward, she launched the Freelands Group, a media and technology investment fund based in London. Her taste in companies over the years has gravitated toward the creative and production side of the media industry. One of her more promising companies is Vertical Networks, a Los Angeles-based startup that makes digital, short-form video series geared toward younger audiences on platforms such as Snapchat, YouTube, and Facebook.While Rupert, 87, may have at long last stopped building an empire, he’s not entirely given up on the thing he might love most: business and political influence. When the Fox deal closes, the Murdochs could end up owning as much as 5.6 percent of Disney, analysts at BTIG estimate, making them the entertainment giant’s biggest stakeholder. They could use the leverage to get the family a seat on Disney’s board and to shape the future leadership of the company. “Rupert is going to be the single largest shareholder at Disney and will have input in picking a replacement for Bob Iger,” says Mario Gabelli, a major investor in Fox.'),\n",

       "  '2019-01-22',\n",
       "  'U.S. companies’ reliance on the country’s giant middle class could turn into a liability.Buick vehicles from General Motors Co. at a car dealership in Shanghai on July 8, 2018.China has long been a magnet for U.S. brands eager to tap its massive population. Even as the heady days of double-digit economic growth ended this decade, the consumer story rolled on as tens of millions were added to the coffee-sipping, moviegoing, smartphone-addicted middle class, a cohort that exceeds 400 million people.Starbucks, Apple, and Walt Disney led the charge into China with Chai Frappuccinos, rose-gold-colored iPhones, and films with Chinese actors and locations woven into plotlines. So when Apple Inc. cut its revenue forecast for the first time in almost two decades on Jan. 3, citing weaker demand in China, a chill swept across corporate America. What if Donald Trump’s trade war has done what Beijing’s crackdown on corruption, pollution, and shadow banking, along with rising living costs and slowing wage growth, hasn’t: shaken the confidence of China’s consumer? “The good times are over,” says Michael Every, head of Asia financial markets research at Rabobank in Hong Kong. “Growth will slow, and even if it doesn’t, rising nationalism means U.S. stuff is no longer cool.”2017Data: World BankSpending by consumers has played an increasingly important role in propping up China’s economy in recent years, as the traditional engines of growth—industrial production and real estate investment—have cooled. Policymakers have encouraged this rebalancing of the economy, supporting generous wage gains even if that eroded China’s export competitiveness.Cracks started to show in the consumer story in 2018 as surging home prices in Beijing, Shanghai, and other megacities began to pinch the upwardly mobile, in particular younger people saving for a deposit while renting. One warning that Chinese shoppers were losing their nerve came in November, when Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., operator of the Tmall online marketplace where many U.S. companies list their goods for sale, downgraded its revenue guidance by as much as 6 percent for the fiscal year ending in March 2019.Estée Lauder Cos., which sells its perfumes and makeup on Tmall as well as in retail outlets in about 120 Chinese cities, relied on China for about 61 percent of its sales growth in the fiscal year ended June 2018, according to a recent report by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analyst Jason English. That degree of China dependency would have been seen as positive months ago, but no longer. English recently changed his recommendation on the stock to sell, noting the possibility of a “significant deceleration” because of tougher conditions in China.Data: International Monetary FundEstée Lauder is still expecting double-digit sales growth in China for its current fiscal year, “albeit at a moderated pace,” according to a company statement, adding that it had introduced brands Darphin and Jo Malone London on Tmall. “We are committed to China and Chinese consumers for the long term and believe our growth is sustainable due to strong fundamentals,” the company said.Softening demand for discretionary items such as imported perfumes and skin treatments isn’t the most worrying indicator that the Chinese consumer is retrenching. Vehicle sales fell in 2018—a first in 28 years— declining 4.1 percent, to 23.7 million units, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. American automakers were among the hardest hit. General Motors Co.’s China arm sold 3.6 million vehicles last year, down 10 percent from 2017.Note: Selected data on the top 50 companies that report China sales; figures for the most recent fiscal year availableData: Compiled by BloombergThe trade war is a major factor in falling auto sales, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Steve Man. “It’s denting consumer confidence. Even though a lot of the buyers probably have the money to buy a new vehicle, they’re unwilling to actually open up the purse strings,” he said during a Jan. 9 interview on Bloomberg Television.Walt Disney Co., which is currently producing a live-action remake of its 1998 animated classic, Mulan, set in China, has also been feeling the pressure. “What we’re seeing in China is maybe a slight reduction in consumer confidence, and that’s having an impact on the business somewhat,” Walt Disney Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger told analysts in a November conference call. He also said the company remains bullish on the country.Year-over-year changeData: U.S. Bureau of Economic AnalysisStarbucks Corp., which expects to have 6,000 cafes in China in four years, up from approximately 3,600 now, said in December that annual same-store sales growth in the country could be as low as 1 percent over the long term, raising concerns about one of its most important markets. And the list goes on: Hyatt Hotels Corp. has been expanding aggressively in China, yet the hotel operator logged only 2.5 percent growth in Asia-Pacific revenue for the third quarter, down from 6.3 percent from the previous year.Not every company sees a slowdown coming. Nike Inc.’s revenue from Greater China jumped 25 percent in the six months ended November, to $2.9 billion, equal to 15 percent of Nike’s total sales, according to a company filing. “We continue to see very strong signs of momentum in China,” Chief Financial Officer Andy Campion said on a December call with analysts. Johnson & Johnson’s business in China grew about 16 percent in the third quarter, CFO Joseph Wolk said at a conference in January. “We’re in pretty good shape in terms of China as it stands today,” he said.Although pricey iPhones are not the ideal instrument for taking the temperature of the world’s No.\\u20092 economy, Apple’s warning and Trump’s trade war may make executive suites rethink whether there’s such a thing as too much China exposure. “We could be in a more choppy period,” says Jeffrey Towson, a professor of investment at Guanghua School of Management at Peking University. —Bruce Einhorn, Xiaoqing Pi, and Enda Curran, with Kim Bhasin'),\n",

       "  '2019-01-16',\n",
       "  'John SkipperOn a recent fall morning, John Skipper is backstage at Madison Square Garden’s Hulu Theater, a 5,600-seat space tucked beneath the famous New York City arena. He’s there to greet Canelo Alvarez, the red-headed Mexican boxer whose only loss in 53 professional fights was to Floyd Mayweather in 2013. Skipper, the executive chairman of sports media startup DAZN Group, has just signed Alvarez to the richest athlete contract in sports history, a $365 million agreement for the rights to broadcast his next 11 fights. In a few minutes the two will wind through hallways and stairwells to the stage, where Alvarez will pose chest-to-chest before the press with his upcoming opponent, Rocky Fielding of Liverpool.In the meantime, Alvarez, in a dark vest and white button-up shirt, is autographing boxing gloves, pulling them from a pile of 300 and dropping each finished pair into a large cardboard box. When Skipper approaches, Alvarez pauses. “Thank you for being here. We are very excited about the deal,” Skipper says, shaking hands. “Muchas gracias.”It’s a big moment for Alvarez, yet Skipper seems the more thrilled of the two. For him, the hoopla marks a big step forward in his comeback from a public stumble. “Today is a lot of adrenaline,” he says prior to heading onstage.A year earlier, Skipper was president of ESPN and one of the most powerful people in television. In his six years on the job and 20 at the network, he helped build it into a $10 billion juggernaut for Walt Disney Co., cutting massive checks to the NBA and NFL and running the machinery that helps turn professional athletes into household names.Skipper had signed a contract that November to stay on for three more years. ESPN was starting to look vulnerable as consumers abandoned cable TV, and Disney Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger wanted him at the helm as the network began the shift to a digital streaming economy. A month later, at ESPN’s headquarters in Bristol, Conn., Skipper sat in front of about 450 on-camera reporters, analysts, and anchors and told them his plans. “I want to lead an ESPN that strives purposely and confidently into a new world, which is not scary but exciting,” he said.Less than a week later, he resigned. “I have struggled for many years with a substance addiction,” Skipper said in a statement announcing his departure. “I have decided that the most important thing I can do right now is to take care of my problem.”The sudden exit fueled speculation that the addiction story was cover for a sexual harassment scandal. The #MeToo movement had already ended the careers of Charlie Rose, Matt Lauer, and other media stars. Fox Sports radio personality Clay Travis, an ESPN critic, tweeted a surreptitious photo of Skipper at a bar with a martini glass at his elbow less than two weeks after his resignation. “ESPN lied about John Skipper’s substance addiction to cover up the real reason he was being fired,” Travis wrote, suggesting that if Skipper had an issue, he wouldn’t be drinking in public. Skipper tried to set the record straight in a March 2018 interview with the Hollywood Reporter. “Someone from whom I bought cocaine attempted to extort me,” he said. When he met with Iger about it, they agreed he should resign.Backstage at the Garden, Skipper makes clear that he’s not interested in rehashing the extortion plot—which, he says, was the sole reason he left. “What I told people was the truth,” he says in a slight drawl, a remnant of his North Carolina upbringing. “Why they don’t choose to believe it, I have no clue.”What does interest him is an article about his ambitious second act, which is why he’s letting me hang around. Skipper, 63, spent his early career at Rolling Stone and Spin and helped start ESPN the Magazine. He knows a little scenery helps a story, so he’s chosen this dressing room chat as a table setter for two later interviews. The story he hopes to tell is about how “the old guy who ran ESPN” is now working at a startup that aims to take its place as the “worldwide leader in sports.” He wants to talk about DAZN (pronounced “da zone”), a subscription streaming service with an odd name and big plans to disrupt sports broadcasting. It’s a neat narrative—incumbent turned insurgent—but Skipper knows he’s entering a brutal contest with one of two outcomes: win by knockout or get knocked out.Skipper won’t call DAZN a “Netflix for sports,” at least not publicly, but it’s useful shorthand. DAZN offers live sports on the internet for a monthly fee. It started in Germany and Japan in summer 2016 and now also operates in Canada, Italy, and the U.S. The German service (which is also available in Austria and Switzerland) offers four of the top European soccer leagues plus the NBA and NFL for about $10 per month. In Japan, subscribers get domestic soccer and baseball, plus MLB, the NFL, three European soccer leagues, and UEFA Champions League, for about $15. U.S. service began in September, offering boxing and mixed martial arts at $10 a month. There are plans to start up in Spain and Brazil later this year.The goal is to become an indispensable part of sports fans’ entertainment budget. It’s a wildly expensive project. Rights packages for top leagues make the cost for a season of Game of Thrones look like pocket change. And DAZN is competing against many of the biggest media companies in the world, including Disney.DAZN has a puncher’s chance because it’s backed by Len Blavatnik. The Ukrainian-born media tycoon built a fortune from oil and aluminum dealings in Russia and now oversees a $20 billion empire that includes Warner Music Group. Skipper joined the management team in May, six months after his ESPN exit. The departure was a stroke of good fortune for DAZN: The most plugged-in executive in the business was suddenly available right as the company was looking to crack the U.S. market. “Everybody better be taking them seriously,” says Rich Greenfield, a media analyst at research company BTIG LLC. “They’ve got large amounts of capital and a talented management team that understands all of the problems of the legacy ecosystem.”DAZN began as part of Perform Group Ltd., a London-based company Blavatnik formed in 2007. Perform built a $450 million business as a middleman for sports content, buying rights to games and data from teams and leagues, then packaging them for broadcasters and bookmakers. In 2014, Perform decided to create its own direct-to-consumer product, setting aside several hundred million dollars to get it off the ground. Consumers were moving to online subscription services for movies, TV, and music. Sports seemed an obvious next step.Perform picked the name DAZN because it stood out and was available as a trademark across dozens of markets, says Joseph Markowski, executive vice president for North America. And yes, the company is aware that people can’t pronounce it: DAZN’s Twitter feed includes a video of heavyweight fighter Anthony Joshua and other athletes struggling with the name, saying “duh-zin” and “day-zin.” That’s OK, Markowski says—it helps make the name memorable.DAZN soon went on a multibillion-dollar spending spree. In Japan alone, it committed $3 billion to rights. The splurge didn’t go unnoticed at ESPN, where Skipper was figuring out the direct-to-consumer business. “We were studying the world of platforms that could deliver simultaneous live streams at scale,” he says at DAZN’s Lower Manhattan offices a few weeks after the Alvarez event. The two best in the business, he decided, were Perform Group and BAMTech LLC, a streaming provider that Major League Baseball began developing in 2000.During the same month that DAZN started in Germany and Japan, Disney paid $1 billion for a one-third share of BAMTech and announced that ESPN would soon operate its first standalone subscription streaming service using BAMTech technology. Then Disney paid an additional $1.6 billion to become BAMTech’s majority owner. Skipper now had the tools to make ESPN a streaming power.It promised to be a heavy lift. The network couldn’t simply vacuum up rights to the most in-demand sports, put them on a slick online platform, and start charging customers. Although it owned the most valuable portfolio in the U.S.—Skipper himself assembled it, spending about $8 billion annually for Monday Night Football, the NBA, MLB, and many of the most-watched college football and basketball games—ESPN was already selling this programming to pay-TV providers for about $8 per month for every home that got the network. These carrier contracts prevented Skipper from selling the same games directly to consumers.The number of homes getting ESPN, meanwhile, had fallen from 100 million in 2011 to 87 million in 2017, according to Nielsen Holdings Plc. Even if Skipper could offer the full firehose of ESPN programming via a streaming service, there was little chance of matching the revenue that had flowed through the fast-decaying cable business model. This was the predicament he’d been alluding to when, just before he resigned, he tried to reassure the network’s on-air talent about the “not scary” very scary new world.In the Hollywood Reporter story, Skipper said that after he resigned, he checked himself into a facility where he got to “understand a bit more about substance use.” He told the interviewer, James Andrew Miller, co-author of the bestselling oral history of ESPN, Those Guys Have All the Fun: “I enjoy a martini, I enjoy a bottle of wine with friends for dinner. I’ve never had an issue with alcohol. You know, I’m an old hippie, and then an old New Yorker from the ’80s.” His addiction, he told Miller, had been cocaine.Skipper’s first job after he finished a master’s in English literature at Columbia University was as a secretary at Rolling Stone in 1979. Over the next decade, he rose to become publisher of US magazine, which was under the same ownership. “He had a lot of friends,” Rolling Stone co-founder Jann Wenner said in Those Guys Have All the Fun. “In those days it was quite the socially intertwined organization, and people had major parts of their social life totally interconnected with the place, you know, free-flowing cocaine, young people intensely involved with their work. And John fit right in with everybody.” Later, when Skipper became one of the most powerful people in sports, an industry full of former jocks and B-school squares, his Rolling Stone background became part of his persona. He was the charismatic Southerner with a countercultural streak.At a diner on the Upper East Side, not far from where he lives, Skipper remains reluctant to say more about what led to his exit from ESPN. “I regret using the word ‘addiction,’ ” he says. “I had some inappropriate behavior.” As he sees it now, buying cocaine was a manifestation of a deeper set of problems: “I had some underlying matters I needed to deal with, which had created a health problem, which I feel that I’ve satisfactorily resolved.” Is the treatment over? “I’ve turned a new leaf. I feel quite confident in my ability to manage my life in a responsible manner.”After leaving ESPN, Skipper laid low for a couple of months. He read Under the Volcano by Malcolm Lowry, the story of an alcoholic British diplomat in Mexico, and a Ulysses S. Grant biography. “Taking off is great,” he says, “but when you’re not taking off from anything, you’re not really taking off, you just don’t have anything to do.” When media friends began coming to him for advice, Skipper thought he could make a business of that, but he abandoned the idea after a few days. He didn’t want to tell other people what to do, he realized; he wanted to be the one doing.In April he had breakfast at the Greenwich Hotel in Manhattan with Simon Denyer, Perform’s CEO and co-founder, who broached the idea of Skipper coming aboard to help run DAZN. “When I looked at what they’ve been able to do in Japan, Germany, and Canada, and thought about being able to try to replicate that around the world, I thought, this is kind of a unique beast,” Skipper says. “We may have the disruptor and the potential winner in this space.” His quick return to the industry was a deliberate statement that he wouldn’t cower. “I wanted to march right back in the room as a chairman of a company and say, ‘I’m fine,’ ” he says.While he was negotiating his contract with Perform, ESPN introduced its long-awaited standalone streaming service. For $5 a month, subscribers to ESPN+ would get games from MLB, Major League Soccer, and the NHL, as well as some college sports and documentaries and other shows not found on the TV network. The grab bag of second-rate programming highlighted the difficulty ESPN faces as it tries to build a new business while protecting its old one. In September, Disney announced that ESPN+ had a million subscribers.At DAZN, Skipper faces the flip side of ESPN’s problems. He has the freedom to sell sports directly to viewers but little to sell. ESPN and the other incumbents have locked up the most-watched leagues into the next decade. The NFL’s slate of Sunday games is next available in 2023. NBA games won’t hit the market until 2025. So two days after Skipper’s hire, Perform announced a $1 billion deal with British promoter Matchroom Boxing that would serve as the foundation of its U.S. service.The $365 million agreement with Alvarez and his representatives at Golden Boy Promotions Inc., which came five months later, is part of a larger deal that includes other top boxers in Golden Boy’s stable and could reach a half-billion dollars if the fights draw enough subscribers. “I didn’t know what DAZN was until John Skipper got a hold of me,” says Oscar De La Hoya, the former prizefighter and Golden Boy co-founder. HBO had announced recently that it was dropping boxing coverage from its network. “I have to admit we were pretty desperate at the time,” says De La Hoya. During negotiations in Los Angeles, he says, Skipper asked what the magic number was to get Alvarez: “I threw out a number, and he didn’t blink. What I see in John is ambition—and a little revenge. When he mentioned, ‘Look, we want to compete with ESPN,’ I said, ‘Of course. Bingo.’ ”A former colleague of Skipper’s who’s spoken with him since he left ESPN (and also is no longer at the network) says Skipper was hurt by how Disney treated him at the end: “He felt like his long service might have suggested a different outcome than ‘goodbye and good luck.’ ” Disney declined to comment.Skipper says he bears no ill will toward his former employer. His focus is expanding DAZN. “If I have gained some perspective from years of working in sports and years of living,” he says, “it is that you better do things that you enjoy, and you better do them for positive reasons.”For now the battle for streaming supremacy is happening at the margins of the U.S. market. ESPN has deep cuts from its vast portfolio. NBC Sports has a variety of “gold” packages for fans who can’t get enough English Premier League soccer, PGA Tour golf, or figure skating. AT&T Inc.’s WarnerMedia offers UEFA Champions League and Europa League soccer on B/R Live for $10 per month. Then again, ESPN got its start on the margins. In 1979 it had bowling, billiards, slow-pitch softball—and plenty of doubters who said a 24-hour sports cable network would never work.Skipper says DAZN is ready to bid on anything and everything that becomes available in the U.S., including the NFL. He expects that leagues will eventually start carving out exclusive rights packages for online-only bidders. In November, DAZN signed a three-year, $300 million agreement with MLB for a nightly show that will feature live look-ins at games starting this coming season. Between boxing and baseball, DAZN has committed about $2 billion in the U.S., and it’s prepared to spend billions more. To help pay for it, Perform reorganized, changing the company name to DAZN Group and splitting it into the streaming service and the digital sports agency. It’s hired a banker to explore a sale of the latter.In the long run, success depends on whether DAZN can make more money in subscriber fees than it spends on rights. Regulatory statements filed in the U.K. show that Perform had operating losses of almost $275 million in 2017, mainly because of spending on DAZN, and that was before costs associated with the U.S. introduction. The company doesn’t release subscriber numbers, but Japan, Skipper says, already counts more than a million payers. At the dollar equivalent of about $15 per month per subscription, that’s about $180 million in annual revenue. The global subscriber tally, he says, is past a million by “some multiples.” The goal is to reach profitability in new markets in four or five years, he says.The closest thing DAZN has to a global rival at the moment is Eleven Sports Network Ltd., a subscription-streaming service in London that operates in 11 markets including the U.K. and the U.S., offering mostly soccer, motor sports, and fights. Eleven, however, lacks Blavatnik’s deep pockets. In December, after reports that it might have to close in the U.K. because of low demand, the company said it was trying to renegotiate its deals with Spanish and Italian soccer leagues.The real worry for DAZN comes from bigger competitors. Disney’s $71 billion purchase of 21st Century Fox Inc. includes sports channels in India, Latin America, and Asia. “I don’t think it will be very long before ESPN+ becomes a global, standalone sports offering,” says Daniel Cohen, a media rights consultant at the Octagon Inc. sports agency. There’s also the threat that a tech giant will go all-in on sports. If Amazon.com or Facebook Inc. decides to swing for the fences, even Blavatnik’s billions might not be enough to win the day.On Dec. 15 at Madison Square Garden, one year to the night after the cocaine buy that cost Skipper his ESPN job, Alvarez pounds Fielding into submission in three rounds. The capacity crowd includes Bruce Willis and John McEnroe but not Skipper. A bad back keeps him home for DAZN’s big night. The choice not to push it is part of his new approach to work.At ESPN, Skipper says, his response to every challenge was the same: “I just worked harder, worked more, worked all the time.” And if he hadn’t slipped up, he probably would have kept at it. “I don’t think I was wise enough to stop,” he says. “I loved being the president of ESPN. But the change has been good to me. Not working for a little while was good to me.”He exercises more now, he says, and eats better. He’s lost 30 pounds. And even though he’s thrown himself into his job, traveling the world in search of rights, he no longer immerses himself in every detail. “I’ll decide that I’m going to put a little hole in my day and go ride my bike around the park,” he says. “One thing they talk a lot about in therapy is mindfulness. Just be aware of what you’re doing. I was barely aware of what I was doing.”A friend at ESPN says that after Skipper left the network, he confided that his life there had been lonely; his exit, as embarrassing as it might have been, was a blessing. “He’s happier than I’ve ever seen him,” the friend says. Skipper’s departure led to introspection about his home life, too. In November he and his wife of 39 years divorced. “He’s broken free from both his personal and professional past,” the friend says.“It’s not anything you would wish on anybody,” Skipper says of the ordeal. He didn’t need the pain it caused his ex-wife and two grown sons, the disruption he caused at ESPN, or the public exposure. Still, he’s comfortable with where he is now. “If I’m in the great gyroscope in the sky somewhere and someone asks, ‘Would you like to turn back and something different happens that day, but you haven’t gotten any smarter?’ … I’d say, ‘Nah.’ I wouldn’t do it.

       "  '2019-01-16',\n",
       "  'Republicans predicted a growth explosion while Democrats warned of fat-cat investors. Both sides were wrong.On Jan. 1, 2018, the biggest, most sweeping U.S. corporate tax cut ever enacted went into effect. A year later, we’re able to see how businesses used all that extra cash.The short answer: to buy back shares. The long answer is slightly more nuanced, but not by much.Corporations had been lobbying lawmakers for years to reduce the corporate income tax rate—which, at 35 percent, was the highest among the U.S.’s major trading partners. Republicans in Congress and the White House framed 2017’s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act as a means to boost employment, enhance wages, and encourage companies to invest and manufacture in the U.S. Among other things, the law reduced the corporate tax rate to 21 percent, at a cost of as much as $1.5 trillion in lost government revenue over 10 years.Annual reports from four companies—Apple, Walt Disney, Visa International, and Starbucks—that completed their fiscal years on Sept. 30 show that free cash flow increased an average 33.7 percent from fiscal years 2017 to 2018. Overall, these four companies used their windfall to boost share buybacks an average 75.5 percent (including 119 percent growth in buybacks for Apple and a 64 percent decline for Disney), while paying out just 9 percent more in dividends (although Starbucks and Visa increased dividend payouts by at least 20 percent). Capital investments—which from now until 2022 are fully deductible in the year a purchase is made—rose 8.6 percent from a year earlier for these companies.Free cash flow increased nearly 34 percent across the board as a result of a tax cut that reduced the corporate rate by 40 percentData: BloombergWhile the law lowered the statutory tax rate, the amount companies pay can vary greatly depending on how profitable they are and how many targeted tax credits and deductions, such as capital expenditures, they can claim. Almost all these companies saw their effective tax rates drop. Some, including Walt Disney Co., saw their rates fall much more than the 40 percent difference between the new and old corporate levies.But effective tax rates won’t stay this low forever. Some of the taxes on international income go up over time, and the tax break for debt will become less generous. “It’s definitely front-loaded,” says Andrew Silverman, a tax policy analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “When rates start going up again, investors will be befuddled.”During the debate over the tax cut bill, Democrats warned that any gains from it were more likely to flow to executives and investors than to workers or the underlying economy. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, echoed that complaint in a February 2018 hearing with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, saying that corporate leaders were “funneling the tax windfall into buybacks that inflate the value of stocks held by affluent executives and wealthy shareholders.” Trump administration officials, including Mnuchin, have defended buybacks, saying they help the economy by freeing up money investors can allocate elsewhere. Ultimately, provisions that encourage companies to make capital expenditures provide about twice as much growth as corporate rate cuts, according to Kyle Pomerleau, an economist at the nonpartisan Tax Foundation.Full and immediate expensing for equipment isn’t projected to yield big boosts in capital spending in the coming yearsData: BloombergAt the end of the day (or rather, year), the law failed to live up to its proponents’ most optimistic promises of 4 percent economic growth, fueled by billions in new equipment purchases. But based on these four companies’ yearend results, it’s also clear that the detractors’ dystopian vision of chief executive officers lining their pockets while workers’ incomes stagnate hasn’t come to pass, either. Republicans have repeatedly pointed to rising wages and lower unemployment as a sign that their plan is—at least partially—working.Of the companies in this group, Apple Inc. is the only one to have made any worker-related pronouncements, pledging in January 2018 to hire 20,000 new employees by 2023. It’s brought in 9,000 new employees since then, the company says, putting it squarely “on track” to meet its goal. In December, Apple announced it would spend $1 billion on a new campus in Austin, Texas, which will accommodate 5,000 additional employees, with the capacity for an additional 10,000.But by far the company’s biggest expense under the tax law was share buybacks. In May, Apple said it would plow $100 billion into its own stock by the end of 2018; as of September, it had spent $72 billion buying back shares. Since then, its stock has had a mixed performance record. Early this year, Apple cut its revenue forecast on weaker-than-expected sales in China tied to the trade war, leading to a sell-off. The company is down for the year so far.Starbucks and Apple more than doubled their share repurchase levels, while Disney eased offData: BloombergWith the biggest year-over-year drop in effective tax rate, to 11.3 percent from 32 percent, Disney increased capital spending by $842 million in fiscal year 2018. Analysts say that figure is unlikely to grow much more in the coming years as slowing advertising sales temper Disney’s expansions in content, technology, and theme parks. Unlike some other companies—notably Apple and Starbucks Corp.—Disney decreased its share buybacks, which is at least partly tied to a pause in repurchases while it completes its acquisition of some of 21st Century Fox’s media assets.Across sectors, companies saw their effective tax rates fall, in some cases even below the 21 percent statutory rateData: BloombergVisa Inc. increased its dividend payouts about 22 percent, from $1.58 billion in 2017 to $1.9 billion in 2018. Many companies, including the other three on this list, announced one-time cash or stock bonuses as a result of the tax law, which some economists have panned as an ineffective way to stimulate growth. But Visa made the relatively rare move of boosting its matches to retirement accounts. Personnel costs increased 21 percent from a year earlier, tied to a larger head count and higher incentive compensation, Visa said in a filing.Shareholder dividends increased by smaller margins than share buybacksData: BloombergHoward Schultz, who was executive chairman of Starbucks when the tax cut passed, panned the law, calling it “fool’s gold.” Still, Starbucks investors benefited from buybacks that more than tripled, to $7 billion, from a year earlier, vs. $2 billion in 2017. Dividends and capital expenditures increased slightly. The company said it also boosted a sick-time benefit for employees and expanded paid parental leave to include nonbirth parents as a result of the tax cut.Starbucks invested about $4.9 billion in dividends, buybacks, and capital equipment in fiscal year 2017Data: Bloomberg The coffee retailer invested $10.9 billion in fiscal year 2018, including one-time stock grants to employees and nearly quadruple the level of share buybacksData: Bloomberg '),\n",
       " ('How Huawei Could Divide the World',\n",
       "  '2018-12-20',\n",
       "  'Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver on Dec. 12. I’m an American journalist who lives in Beijing, but I just happened to be visiting South Korea when news broke that Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of Chinese telecom giant Huawei Technologies Co., had been arrested in Canada on Dec. 1. She was detained at the behest of the U.S. for allegedly misleading financial institutions about the company’s Iran business, causing them to violate U.S. sanctions. I called my wife, who works in the Chinese capital too, and joked about this ominous turn in Chinese-American relations: “Maybe it’s safer not to go back.”The quip turned out not to be very funny after I did return. Within days, Chinese authorities scooped up two Canadian citizens who, despite Beijing’s denials, were soon seen by the outside world as pawns in China’s attempts to extract Meng from Canadian—and potential U.S.—custody. In Vancouver, Meng received a public hearing in an independent court. That’s in contrast to China, where it’s still unclear why the Canadians were detained and where, more fundamentally, law can be contravened by power and judges are instruments of the Communist Party. Even foreign nationals can vanish into prison cells. For now, the detention of Michael Kovrig, a former diplomat who works for a policy think tank, and Michael Spavor, a businessman, have made expatriate Americans like me worry how much we’re at Beijing’s mercy. In a similar way, Chinese businessmen saw Meng’s arrest as a disincentive to traveling to and investing in the U.S.The detentions are the most frightening development yet taken in the widening confrontation between the U.S. and China. What started as a scuffle over tariffs and trade balances, then expanded into a battle for control of future technologies, may be degenerating into an intimate war against each other’s people. That makes it directly personal in a way trade and tariffs weren’t.In a remarkable comment when asked on CNBC if a senior U.S. tech executive should be in China right now, Leland Miller, chief executive officer of research firm China Beige Book, said, “I would not. Too much risk.” According to Reuters, the U.S. Department of State is considering issuing a travel warning to Americans about visiting China. “Now the U.S. and Canadian executives could be a bit nervous traveling to China,” one Chinese newspaper editor tweeted in the wake of the Meng arrest, “and even more so for Chinese executives traveling to the U.S. and Canada.”Is this how far we’ve fallen? The sad irony is that this ugly saga is unfolding as China celebrates the 40th anniversary of its embrace of the world. It was in December 1978 that paramount leader Deng Xiaoping told party members to “emancipate the mind”—to break with Maoist orthodoxy and revel in fresh thinking to help the nation. That launched his country’s capitalist reforms, a central pillar of which was “opening up” to end China’s poverty-creating isolation and integrate with the global economy. In flowed the capital and technology that contributed to China’s economic miracle and built the nation into the superpower it is today.An often underappreciated aspect of that great integration is the people. Foreigners played an unheralded role in rebuilding China’s economy and fortunes. We tend to think of “intellectual property” as proprietary software code or secret cola recipes, but it’s more than that. It’s also the know-how about running modern factories or managing money that countless expatriate executives from the U.S. and around the world imported into China for industries from automobiles to fast food. And there’s been a return for that: The riches amassed by the Chinese are being spent on Buicks and Starbucks lattes and filling hotels from Times Square to Walt Disney World.In the decades since China’s opening, Americans and Chinese have for the most part been able to set aside the vast divergence in their political systems to find common ground that their governments sometimes haven’t. For Americans, the fascination with the fabulous Middle Kingdom is a modern extension of the wonderment Marco Polo first sparked in the 14th century with tales of great “Cathay.” China was, and is, a fairytale land of imperial palaces, untold riches, and limitless opportunity. For Chinese, the U.S. remains something of the old “city on the hill,” whose lights may have dimmed a bit but is still a beacon of freedom and hope. That’s why more than 360,000 Chinese students were enrolled in U.S. universities in the last academic year, the most from any country and a record for China. I myself have become an avid student of Chinese history and philosophy since relocating to Beijing seven years ago.Now we have to worry that those doors are closing. The Trump administration has started restricting visas for certain Chinese students, fearing they’ll steal U.S. technology, and he supposedly considered an outright ban. China’s government doesn’t go out of its way to encourage its citizens to visit anyway. Beijing’s embassy in Washington issued a warning for Chinese travelers this year about the frequent shootings and expensive health care in the U.S.China isn’t rolling out the red carpet for foreigners, either. Officials sometimes run campaigns with videos and posters warning locals of foreign “spies.” Although policymakers profess to be wooing foreign talent to China’s tech sectors, in practice they’re scaring people off. The government in 2019 will increase the tax burden on some foreign residents, rendering the country, with its toxic air and rising costs, an even less attractive place to live. In a 2018 survey of U.S. businessmen by the American Chamber of Commerce in China, a staggering three out of four said they feel increasingly unwelcome in the country. That’s due in part to their belief that Chinese regulators do not treat them on equal terms with their domestic rivals. Beijing can also be quick to penalize foreign companies that run afoul of its political sensitivities. Earlier this year, authorities ordered Marriott International to shut down its website in the country after the hotel operator distributed a questionnaire listing Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Tibet as independent countries. (Beijing sees all of them as part of China.)Perhaps shifting politics in the two countries made such antiforeign sentiment inevitable. In China, a surveillance-obsessed police state has intensified efforts to snuff out any civic action or alternative thinking—dangerous foreign ideals included. President Xi Jinping’s government launched a campaign against “western values” and purged foreign content from school textbooks. He’d prefer that educators teach Chinese literature and morality—or better yet, Communist Party ideology—that the regime considers more appropriate. The “opening up” so core to Deng and China’s success has become more rhetoric than reality as an increasingly nationalist government has stalled market reforms in favor of statist programs to develop Chinese champions. In a closely watched Dec. 18 speech celebrating the 40th anniversary of reform, Xi struck a defiant tone, saying no one can dictate to the country. Meanwhile, Trump’s “America First” mantra paints China as a technology-swindling, job-stealing threat to U.S. national security and economic primacy. In addition to trade-restricting tariffs, Washington has introduced more stringent controls on foreign investment—a move clearly designed to keep vital U.S. technology out of Chinese hands.These policies on both sides of the Pacific have already started disentangling two economies tightly intertwined by supply chains, trade, and capital. A recent survey of U.S. companies in China discovered that nearly a fifth of respondents were considering relocating manufacturing operations out of the country because of the trade dispute and deteriorating U.S.-China relations. Trump is encouraging this withdrawal by attacking American companies from General Motors Co. to Apple Inc. for manufacturing in China rather than creating more jobs in the U.S. Chinese investment in the U.S. has plunged, not only because of perceived American hostility but also because China’s government has started controlling how its companies can invest abroad.It then seems not all that surprising that a disengagement of the Chinese and American people would come next. Already, they’re divided digitally. China blocks major American social media—including Facebook, YouTube, and Instagram—along with a host of other prominent U.S. internet services. That’s locked many Chinese in their own digital universe, where they communicate on Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s WeChat instead of WhatsApp, microblog on Sina Weibo, not Twitter, and search on Baidu in place of Google—all are Chinese companies with a limited international presence.Economic and political division is bad enough for the U.S.-China relationship. Curtailing exchanges between citizens would arguably be more worrisome. If executives, students, and tourists begin to fear traveling between the two countries—or aren’t permitted to—maintaining peaceful relations between the world’s greatest powers will be more difficult.What would be lost is the mutual understanding—of each other’s cultures, societies, and ambitions—fostered by personal conversations and experience. Without that, there might be nothing left to prevent relations between Beijing and Washington from freezing over into a renewed cold war.Sure, there are signs the current tussle might get resolved. At a December dinner after the latest Group of 20 summit in Argentina, Trump and Xi were able to call a truce in their trade war and restart negotiations. As it turned out, Huawei’s Meng was arrested the same day as Trump and Xi’s peacemaking dinner—but in a positive sign, Beijing so far has remained committed to pursuing trade talks anyway. It even appears Xi might be willing to compromise on China’s state-led industrial policies, a key concern of the White House that Beijing has previously considered sacrosanct. Trump has hinted (to the horror of those committed to an independent judiciary) that he could intervene on behalf of the arrested Meng to speed a trade deal. Skepticism reigns among China watchers that Xi will sincerely drop the “state” from China’s “state capitalism.” But maybe six months from now, tensions will ease and Americans can feel comfortable visiting the Great Wall without worrying about being trapped within it.Or maybe not. We have to consider that the level of trust between China and the U.S. has diminished to an alarming degree, and rebuilding may take more than cutting tariffs. In the U.S., China has become in many eyes the new evil empire, a larcenous cheater bent on world domination at America’s expense. To the Chinese, the U.S. often seems an overbearing foreign power, intent on frustrating China’s rise. Deng’s spirit of openness, 40 years later, is in grave danger. That’s a setback not just for China and the U.S., but for the world.'),\n",
       " ('Jeffrey Katzenberg’s Investment Firm Takes a Risky Bet on Mobile Video',\n",
       "  '2018-12-20',\n",
       "  'The Hollywood veteran’s new venture sets its sights on small screens—and beyond.Katzenberg, Daly, and Jaswa.One recent December evening, DreamWorks Animation co-founder Jeffrey Katzenberg weaved through a room atop a trendy Hollywood hotel. As the sun set and the sky glowed pink through the windows, he greeted his guests, an assortment of soft-spoken private equity investors mixing with music industry icons, Silicon Valley technophiles, and a Bulgari jewelry heiress. Although the small talk was awkward, they all had at least one thing in common: Katzenberg and his partners had personally persuaded them to plow a combined $769 million into their newest brainchild, representing the ultimate Valley-Hollywood mashup, WndrCo.Pronounced “Wonder Co.,” the consumer technology holding company is part private equity shop, part incubator, and part old-fashioned venture investor. It mostly makes careful bets on unexciting but profitable tech companies while sprinkling a few hundred thousand dollars as seed investments here and there across dozens of embryonic startups that could flop—or define the next generation of entertainment. “It’s an asymmetrical risk and reward,” says Colin Lind, a Bay Area-based pilot and retired professional investor who’s putting a portion of his personal fortune into WndrCo. “The downside risk is you get a T-bill rate of return, and the upside is 20 times your money.”Its most ambitious undertaking so far is Quibi, Katzenberg’s plan to create a library of polished, Game of Thrones-quality short-form video shows for mobile phones. Named for the “quick bites” of entertainment it intends to offer consumers daily, Quibi has raised $1 billion from WndrCo, technology companies such as Alibaba Group, and almost a dozen major movie studios including Walt Disney, 21st Century Fox, and Time Warner. The idea, as the always peppy Katzenberg pitches it to agents, stars, and studios, is for Quibi to add to viewers’ choices, not cannibalize existing content. Some influential industry names, including actor Leonardo DiCaprio and filmmakers Antoine Fuqua and Guillermo del Toro, are on board, and Katzenberg says he has buy-in from all the top studios, which are also investors or members of Quibi’s advisory board.The early support has given Quibi momentum and generated buzz for WndrCo. But building a library of content from scratch, at a caliber that can compete with streaming giants Netflix Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., means Quibi will need to spend money. A lot of it. Driven by the boom in demand for online content, the average price to produce a drama has almost doubled from two or three years ago to more than $5 million an episode, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Quibi pays all production costs and doesn’t retain the rights indefinitely. While that creates what Katzenberg describes as a “total no-brainer” partnership for the major studios and talent, it also means Quibi is bearing the financial risk of this unproven model. The startup ultimately plans to make money through ads and subscriptions.Quibi won’t roll out its service until sometime in 2020, and at least one direct competitor is beating it to market: Los Angeles-based Fiction Riot LLC plans to launch its Ficto app for watching short premium mobile videos in early January. Still, if the concept catches on, the payoff could be huge. Katzenberg and Quibi Chief Executive Officer Meg Whitman, who previously led EBay Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co., get downright giddy describing what they hope will grow into a $50 billion business. “The enthusiasm across the board from the creative side, the storytelling side, of Hollywood has been like actually nothing I have ever seen before,” Katzenberg told investors.With Quibi chewing through money and commanding the bulk of Katzenberg’s attention (he spends four days of every week on it), WndrCo is relying for now on its other, less flashy companies to grind out a profit. One of those workhorses is mobile privacy and security company AnchorFree Inc. Founded in 2005, the Redwood City, Calif.-based startup was backed by angel investors until 2012, when Goldman Sachs Group Inc. bought a stake and joined the board. The investment bank helped impose financial discipline but did little to nurture experimentation and growth. In 2018, WndrCo led a $295 million investment in the aging but profitable company, giving AnchorFree money to develop products, pursue acquisitions, and possibly add a sales team for the first time. The infusion, with participation from Accel and other investors, also included buying Goldman’s shares for roughly the same price the bank paid for them six years earlier, according to people familiar with the transaction who weren’t authorized to speak publicly. WndrCo partner Sujay Jaswa, a former Dropbox Inc. finance chief, was named AnchorFree’s chairman in September. “Sujay is always calling with new ideas, and Jeffrey calls every week to see how he can help with team building and intros,” says AnchorFree CEO and co-founder David Gorodyansky.WndrCo has had a healthy pipeline from the beginning, reviewing about 1,700 potential venture deals since it started investing in 2017; the partners have backed just a half-dozen so far. Investments follow a pattern: WndrCo pours in money and offers advice to boost growth and wring more profit from a company in a business where a WndrCo partner has deep expertise. Partner Anthony Saleh, former manager of rap artist Nas, advises both restaurant review site the Infatuation and mobile music platform Mixcloud. ChenLi Wang is the subscription revenue specialist among the partners, and Andrew Chang, former general counsel at DreamWorks Animation, is the legal heavyweight of the group.WndrCo partner Ann Daly concedes that hiring seasoned, successful leaders to run their portfolio companies is expensive but says it’s part of the investment thesis. “That is the bet,” she says. Founders who come to them “are not buying into a theory. They are buying a company that has proven expertise in all of these areas, which comes with people who actually have that experience.”'),\n",

       "  '2018-11-16',\n",
       "  'A Cinemark movie theater in Los Angeles on Oct. 29, 2017.Theater owners in the U.S. have plenty to feel good about. Moviegoing is up, and by the close of 2018, theater chains should set records for domestic ticket revenue. A busy 2019 slate with a Star Wars sequel, Toy Story 4, and Joker, about Batman’s nemesis, could put even more fans in seats—delivering the first back-to-back years of attendance growth since 2002.Turn the house lights up, though, and challenges loom. The money-losing, all-you-can-watch MoviePass service has upended ticket pricing, forcing theater chains to offer their own subscriptions, sometimes with steep discounts. Also, Walt Disney Co.’s purchase of most of 21st Century Fox Inc.’s assets including its film studio will give Disney leverage to demand better terms from the theaters. “Theatrical has been under assault since television was invented, and each successive window for watching movies has been perceived as a huge threat,” says Michael Pachter, a Wedbush Securities Inc. analyst. On the rise of subscription use, he said: “That is a problem, and that is going to be eaten by the exhibitor.”Some investors remain concerned about theater chains’ loss of leverage after the Disney-Fox deal closes in 2019. Disney’s $2.8 billion in ticket sales through early November accounts for almost 30 percent of the box office this year, roughly double its nearest competitor, Comcast Corp.’s Universal Pictures. With Fox, Disney’s share will approach 40 percent, according to researcher Box Office Mojo.Data: Box Office MojoDisney, whose properties include the Star Wars, Marvel, and Pixar franchises, has sometimes demanded more than 60 percent of ticket revenue for its biggest releases, compared with the industry’s typical 50-50 split. Adding Fox’s film franchises including X-Men, Planet of the Apes, and Avatar will only increase Disney’s bargaining power.That isn’t necessarily a bad thing, argues Eric Wold, an analyst at B. Riley Financial Inc. Despite getting a smaller share of revenue from those often-blockbuster films, “you would rather have 35 percent of a $1 billion film than 50 percent of a $50 million film,” Wold says. Disney didn’t respond to requests for comment.Investors in theater chains also wonder about Fox’s post-buyout film production levels. The studio has released as many as 25 movies annually in recent years, vs. 13 or less from Disney—sparking worries that the new parent company’s focus on big-budget megahits will ultimately lead to the combined studios making fewer releases.The popularity of subscription plans has been a mixed blessing. MoviePass Inc., which once let fans see a picture a day for $9.95 a month, may have contributed $138 million in additional revenue over the summer, accounting for half of the industry’s seasonal increase, says Greg Durkin, a former Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. executive who now runs the research firm Guts + Data, which uses Screen Engine/ASI data to decipher industry trends.Theater chain Cinemark Holdings Inc.’s year-old Movie Club, which costs $8.99 for one ticket a month plus various discounts on concessions and additional tickets, had drawn 445,000 members as of November. Rival AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. says its $19.95 AMC Stubs A-List service, which lets fans see three movies a week, will exceed 500,000 subscribers in November. “This business is healthy by increasing attendance,” raising the potential number of customers for high-margin food and beverages, says Cinemark Chief Executive Officer Mark Zoradi.Still, subscription plans can affect theaters’ sales. AMC said attendance revenue was unchanged in the third quarter, even with a 9 percent surge in attendance at U.S. theaters, in part because of the A-List program. So AMC in January will raise prices in 15 states where its subscription program is most popular, including California, Florida, Illinois, New York, and New Jersey.'),\n",

       "  \"From left: Shinola's 47mm Runwell, 34mm Birdy, and 41mm Runwell watches.Source: ShinolaFive years ago, the city of Detroit filed the largest public-sector bankruptcy in United States history. Today, it’s got a new nickname: “Comeback City.” Tom Lewand has been through all of it, first as an executive with the Detroit Lions, and since 2016 as chief executive officer of the watch and leather goods brand Shinola. Bloomberg’s Carol Massar and Jason Kelly spoke with Lewand about the Motor City’s recovery, the larger retail crisis, and the most practical accessory a man can own.There seems to be a renaissance of the watch as accessory. Why?With our customers, there is a movement for both analog and digital watches. People are saying they want a little bit of both. We want our Apple Watch or our Fitbit on when we’re exercising or up and about during the day or doing business—maybe we want notifications. Then we want that timeless piece on our wrist when we’re going out to dinner; when we’re dressed up, it just fits better. There aren’t many accessories that men can choose from, and watches are one of the most practical. I don’t think they’ll ever go out of style.You guys have had an impressive brand expansion: leather goods, bags, bicycles, \\xadjewelry. Is it still largely about watch sales?The growth opportunity for us right now is in the leather space. We’ve seen phenomenal growth this year, with wallets, passport [holders], journal covers, and belts, all the way up to our men’s and women’s bags. The market for leather bags in the U.S. is far larger than the market for analog watches.You mentioned some of our other categories. Those really round out the collection and lend some depth to the brand. When we can go out and partner with manufacturers here in America to do our journals—or really cool collaborations with a Benchmade knife, or a New Era cap to celebrate Jackie Robinson—that allows us to tell some wonderful stories about American craftsmanship, American quality, and American brands. We’re launching one for Mickey Mouse’s 90th anniversary with Disney, which is arguably the most iconic brand in America.Your stores have a distinct feel. How does retail play into the broader sales strategy?It’s a critical component. We’re a brand that cries out for people to touch it and feel it and experience it from a product standpoint—being able to put that watch on your wrist and feel the quality—but also the experience in the store. There aren’t any truly omnichannel retailers out there. A lot of people in retail are \\xadmultichannel—they’ve got great e-commerce, they’ve got great bricks-and-mortar—but \\xadcreating that one-to-one relationship with the customers is really important to us specifically, and I think to the retail industry in general.When people tell you, “C’mon, brick-and-\\xadmortar, it’s not working,” what do you say?I couldn’t disagree more. The market will tell you that. As much as online sales are growing, that only represents a small portion of overall retail commerce. Especially with us, when we’re an analog brand in a digital world, people want to look and feel and experience that. Increasingly we see with bricks-and-mortar, people want to do that in a sort of owned and operated kind of environment. If they’re going to experience the brand, more and more they want to experience it in a curated environment that the brand stands behind. That’s not to take away from Nordstrom’s or Neiman Marcus or any of the great retailers out there. It’s just that that brand experience can be much more immersive and comprehensive in our own stores.I also think the market is telling us that brick-and-mortar’s not dead when digital brands that started out as e-commerce are now going into brick-and-mortar and are raising capital to expand there.It’s the Year Ahead Issue, so in 2019: Any plans to go public?No plans for ’19 to do anything in the public markets. We think this is going to be a great year with some great new offerings. And it will be the first full year of operations for our new hotel here in Detroit.Is there a lesson for others in creating manufacturing in a city that most had given up on?We’re not so bold enough to think that we’ve got any of the answers, but we do know that with a healthy degree of humor and tenacity, you can get a lot of great things done. But you only do that when you work together. When you have men and women here in Detroit who were delivering pizzas or working security jobs and were maybe unemployed and now they’re building world class timepieces? That’s a pretty powerful example of a community coming together, not just at the Shinola business level but the fantastic support we got at the larger business level here in Detroit from the public sector.People gave us a big bear hug here in Detroit, and they helped build Shinola. It really is an example that we can do a heck of a lot more together than we can do apart.\"),\n",

Building on a history of dealmaking that included Fairmont Hotels; the Miramax film studio, co-founded by Harvey Weinstein; and Michael Jackson’s Neverland Ranch, Barrack aimed to raise $2.5 billion to buy distressed European real estate assets and generate returns greater than 15 percent, a confidential investor pitch obtained by Bloomberg Businessweek shows. The conversations that weekend bubbled with optimism.A few weeks earlier, Donald Trump, one of Barrack’s oldest friends, had announced he was running for president. The two real estate investors met in the mid-1980s, and Barrack entertained the crowd with war stories of deals they’d done together. While the campaign was the butt of many jokes at Le Club 55, according to two people who were there, Barrack startled guests with a different take. He said he thought Trump’s brash, authentic style would take him to the White House—and that he’d make a better president than candidate. Even employees who’d spent decades helping their boss place counterintuitive bets called the prediction crazy.For Barrack, the tanned, bald, charismatic son of a Lebanese-American grocer from California, Trump’s candidacy became an obsession. In the months that followed, he would devote himself to Trump’s campaign, all but disappearing from the company he’d founded in 1991 and built into one of the world’s highest-profile real estate investment firms. While Barrack’s fundraising and TV appearances have been well-documented, he also assisted in ways that haven’t been reported. According to people familiar with the matter, he allowed Colony’s New York office, kitty-corner from Trump Tower, to be used for sensitive transition-team meetings. As a favor to Paul Manafort, a longtime friend he’d helped install as head of Trump’s campaign, he hired a woman whose duties included scheduling his campaign appearances. And he suggested that an investor familiar with Colony donate to a super PAC led by an ally of Manafort’s.Helping a fading reality-TV star with no political experience capture the White House might have led to a role in the administration or made Colony a magnet for money from around the world. But mixing business and politics hasn’t worked out for Colony’s 71-year-old executive chairman. Instead, he damaged relations with the Qatari royal family, his best business partner in the Middle East, by helping orchestrate a relationship between the White House and the Saudis. Meanwhile, Colony hemorrhaged talent, raised only half the debt fund’s target, and entered into an ill-fated merger. Its shares have fallen about 60 percent since Trump’s inauguration, even as U.S. market indexes have risen more than 20 percent.This story about Barrack’s misadventures in politics is based on interviews with more than a dozen current and former Colony employees, lobbyists, business partners, and campaign officials, most of whom requested anonymity to speak about private dealings. Barrack declined to be interviewed for this story, but his representatives dispute parts of this account. They say he remained engaged with the company, didn’t expect anything in return for making introductions to Middle East leaders, and continues to have excellent relations with rulers of Gulf countries despite increased feuding among some royal families.“Barrack as chairman is responsible for creating a macro vision and expanding the global brand,” said Owen Blicksilver, a spokesman for Barrack, in a statement. “Politics around the world is an integral part of developing a vision.”To the extent that he holds political beliefs, Barrack believes in Trump. He experiences politics largely on an emotional level, according to people who know him. A lifelong Republican, he’s nevertheless given money to California Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, whose husband is a business partner. He briefly worked in the administration of President Ronald Reagan, whose Santa Barbara, Calif., ranch was near one of Barrack’s properties. Trump is just another rich friend, his rich friends say.At first, Barrack’s campaign involvement was limited mainly to strategy calls with Trump. He’d long maintained a robust travel schedule, visiting company offices and attending investor meetings around the world while still finding time for polo and winemaking. Employees assumed he’d have no trouble balancing the campaign with everything else. Nevertheless, to his friends, it was clear he was becoming invested. “For anybody around him, you’d have to live inside a freezer not to realize he was getting more involved,” says Nacho Figueras, the Argentine model and professional polo star who frequently plays with Barrack.By early 2016, Barrack’s agenda also included finalizing the sale of Colony’s stake in Miramax to the government of Qatar. The Gulf nation was already part owner of the Hollywood studio, having teamed up with Colony to buy it from Walt Disney Co. for $660 million in 2010. It was a typical deal for Barrack and Qatar. For years, when Colony bought an exotic asset—a French soccer team, a sprawling Sardinian resort—it was usually with Qatari backing. Those deals led to a friendship with Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani, better known as HBJ, who led Qatar from 2007 to 2013 and oversaw its wealth fund.Barrack would do favors for the Qataris, including helping them wrest a controlling stake in London’s Claridge’s hotel from a pair of tenacious British billionaires; coordinating the construction of a 77,000-square-foot Bel Air mansion for HBJ, rumored to cost $100 million; and making political connections. With an estimated $335 billion under management, the Qatar Investment Authority is one of the shrewder funds in the Gulf, and its support for some of Barrack’s oddball purchases indicated to other investors that there was a method to his madness. After jointly holding assets for a few years, Qatari companies would buy out Colony for an impressive profit. The Miramax deal returned 350 percent, a person with knowledge of the transaction told Bloomberg when it closed in March 2016.Things weren’t going as well in other corners of the Colony empire—by then shares of the company had fallen a third from a year earlier. The Trump campaign was a bright spot. On the last day of February, Barrack went public with his support for Trump, the first prominent Wall Street moneyman to do so, praising the candidate for his “mastery of financial, political, and economic intellectual complexity combined with his charm and emotional intelligence.” The next day was Super Tuesday, with primaries in 11 states. Trump won seven, cementing his status not just as one to take seriously, but as the one to beat.How Trump’s and Barrack’s business histories yielded a friendship is something of a mystery. Their relationship began with Barrack helping to sell Trump two assets the latter couldn’t afford. The first was Alexander’s, a struggling department-store chain. In 1986, Barrack’s boss, Texas investor Robert Bass, sold Trump a 20 percent stake in the company, which Trump pledged as collateral for a bank loan and later had to forfeit to pay off the debt.The following year, the Plaza Hotel was on the market. Barrack led negotiations for Bass and won the prize—then resold it to Trump, who coveted the landmark visible from his New York office. After months of bargaining, Barrack got Trump to pay about $400 million for the hotel, yielding Bass an estimated profit of more than $50 million in less than a year. Interest payments on the money Trump borrowed to finance the deal eclipsed the Plaza’s revenue, and by 1992 the hotel was forced into bankruptcy.The two continued flirting with other investments. Colony considered refinancing a loan for Trump’s Manhattan West Side rail yards project but couldn’t make the numbers work. Barrack weighed buying a controlling stake in Trump’s casinos but acquired a competing Atlantic City venue instead, then hired a former Trump executive to run it. In 2012, when Trump won approval to convert Washington’s Old Post Office building into a hotel, Colony was initially named as the financier, until Deutsche Bank AG stepped in.Still, the two remained friendly. Both have been married three times and have talked each other through divorces. They’ve been kind to each other in the business press, a venue of special importance to Trump.The Plaza deal made Barrack’s career, launching him into the upper echelons of finance. But years later, when Barrack told the story of the transaction at the Republican National Convention in July 2016, he gave it a more self-deprecating cast. Glossing over the candidate’s financing difficulties and bankruptcies, he said Trump had “played me like a Steinway piano.”Price change since Trump’s inaugurationA few months before the convention, with Trump’s campaign still hurtling toward the nomination and Barrack talking up the candidate on cable news, Saudi Arabia’s then-Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, better known as MBS, announced a bold plan to diversify the country’s assets in preparation for a post-oil world. State-owned Saudi Arabian Oil Co. would sell shares to the public and use the projected $2 trillion in proceeds to build up its sovereign wealth fund, he said in April 2016.To find, buy, and manage the assets the country would be acquiring with the proceeds, it would need an army of financiers. Barrack, who’d played the same role for the Qataris, was one of many who wanted in, according to three people familiar with his thinking. As a young lawyer working for Richard Nixon’s personal attorney in the early 1970s, Barrack had been sent to Saudi Arabia to do work on behalf of engineering and construction company Fluor Corp., which in turn led to a friendship with a couple of Saudi princes. But the Saudi royal family is sprawling and fractious, and Barrack hadn’t done deals with the country’s sovereign fund. His principal connection was to Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, his partner in taking the Fairmont Raffles hotel chain private in 2006. But Alwaleed wasn’t close to MBS, and with the latter consolidating power in the kingdom, he’d be of little help to Barrack.He eventually found his opportunity in Yousef Al Otaiba, ambassador to the U.S. from the United Arab Emirates and another longtime friend of Barrack’s. As the campaign heated up, Otaiba reached out to complain about Trump’s threat to ban Muslim immigrants around the same time as MBS’s announcement. In the byzantine world of Gulf royalty, Otaiba is a good friend to have. He’s aligned with Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the crown prince of Abu Dhabi, the largest by area of the seven emirates that make up the U.A.E. The Abu Dhabi crown prince supported MBS’s rise and had counseled him that a closer relationship with the U.S. was possible through improved ties with Israel.“Confusion about your friend Donald Trump is VERY high,” Otaiba wrote Barrack in one of several emails obtained by the New York Times. Barrack advised Otaiba not to pay much attention to rhetoric, mentioned Trump’s real estate projects in Dubai, and arranged a meeting with the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, the published emails show. “Obviously I would like the meeting to be arranged by you and me rather than Blackstone,” he wrote in a separate email. (Barrack’s experience in the Middle East was a valuable resource to the Trump campaign and later the administration, said Blicksilver, Barrack’s spokesman. “The introduction to the leaders of the Arab world was not for political reasons but rather to form thoughtful points of view on the issues which had plagued the region for decades,” he added.)Kushner was receptive to an alliance among Gulf countries, the U.S., and Israel, which he saw as a way to pressure Palestinians into accepting a peace deal. Barrack soon began talking up the Saudi line in public. “The United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia and Israel—in my opinion—will align as allies very quickly here, and the world could change for the better,” he told Bloomberg TV in May 2016. Barrack went even further toward aligning himself with Saudi Arabia later that year, calling the kingdom “our longest and strongest ally” and “reliable defenders of the West’s diverse interests in the region.”At home in the Colony offices, the situation was considerably less auspicious. The company was in the middle of a merger with New York-based NorthStar, whose chief executive officer, David Hamamoto, shared Barrack’s laid-back demeanor.NorthStar was a mess. It had almost quadrupled the assets it had under management in two years by buying real estate portfolios with little regard for quality, funded with floating-rate debt. When rates started rising in late 2015, NorthStar’s interest payments did, too. That wouldn’t have been a problem were it not for how NorthStar was structured. The firm was an externally managed trust that was required to pay a nonnegotiable annual management fee of $186 million to another publicly traded company, also run by Hamamoto, no matter how it performed. Much of that went to the executive, resulting in a $75 million payout in 2014 that made Hamamoto one of America’s best-paid business leaders. To cover its interest payments, NorthStar had to weigh selling assets, which would threaten its ability to generate enough profit to pay the fees. Shares were plunging, and ratings companies threatened to reduce both NorthStar firms to junk status.Barrack first discussed the idea of combining the companies with Hamamoto at New York’s Ritz-Carlton in January 2016, seeing a classic distressed-debt scenario. Colony executives talked about becoming the next Blackstone. Hamamoto, who didn’t respond to calls and emails seeking comment, saw something else, former employees say: an exit strategy.Once the outlines of the deal were agreed on in mid-2016, the companies began to merge their operations. NorthStar employees, not all of whom were enamored with Trump, were struck by Barrack’s absences—and by the regularity with which they were asked to keep up with his political pronouncements. It was standard practice at Colony for employees to receive an email anytime he was going on television, followed by a link to the video of the appearance. Now those clips featured Barrack talking up Trump. Several complaints to human resources yielded no changes, former employees say.With Barrack’s attention elsewhere, negotiations fell largely to his deputy, Colony CEO Richard Saltzman. The companies were hopelessly complex, with multiple business lines and subsidiaries. One of NorthStar’s main investment areas was health-care properties, where Colony had little expertise. Valuing the companies proved a challenge, even though both firms routinely made just these kinds of assessments. In the end, Saltzman and Hamamoto agreed to the bankers’ equivalent of throwing their hands up in the air: a merger of equals that assumed the companies’ stock prices accurately reflected the value of their underlying assets.As negotiations entered their final stages, the Trump campaign was reaching its zenith. In at least one instance, according to a person familiar with the encounter, when an investor asked how best to back Trump, Barrack suggested the Rebuilding America Now super PAC, headed by a family friend of Manafort’s, Laurance Gay. (There was nothing improper in the suggestion. But the group later drew scrutiny for continuing to pay Gay $35,000 a month long after the election.) And in addition to hiring a woman at Manafort’s request, he later retained longtime Manafort associate and campaign deputy Rick Gates as a consultant to the firm. (Gates was fired after being indicted for lying to officials earlier this year. He later pleaded guilty.)The deal closed in January 2017. A few months later a wooden crate showed up on the desk of an assistant to Hamamoto containing a book of leather swatches for use in custom yachts. Some employees took it as a sign that he was planning to jump ship—and that they should as well. By November, Hamamoto had submitted his resignation. Other NorthStar executives sold shares and left.At the time of the merger, the combined company had a market value of about $8 billion. Today, investors value it at less than $3 billion. Saltzman has blamed the decline on “more challenging industry conditions” and a failure to raise as much capital as hoped.Blicksilver, Barrack’s spokesman, said that while results have been disappointing so far, “there is no reason to believe this was attributable to any missteps on Barrack’s part, nor that it will not ultimately be a successful combination.”Trump’s inauguration marked the peak of Barrack’s influence. The president-elect named him chairman of the inaugural committee, and he raised a record $106.7 million—important to a man who likes to claim records. On the day Trump took the oath of office, Barrack was seated behind Trump’s brother Robert and in front of Sheldon Adelson, the Republican Party’s most generous donor. Sporting a blue scarf and matching tie, Barrack smiled broadly and snapped photos.Even as he celebrated, however, some within Colony worried. Management reminded employees that the firm had achieved new prominence thanks to the political activities of its founder, but many found that, to the contrary, its association with the president was producing headwinds. Fundraising in Europe, where Trump was unpopular, had become more difficult, and a pickup in Israeli interest wasn’t enough to close the gap. The debt fund Barrack had been so optimistic about stalled out at $1.3 billion, about half of the original goal. Blicksilver said it was a strategic decision to stop at that level.Barrack’s diplomatic efforts were backfiring, too. Trump made Saudi Arabia the first stop on his first overseas trip in May 2017, partly as a result of Barrack’s lobbying. But a month later, just as MBS was being named crown prince, he and other Gulf leaders announced a blockade of Qatar, which they said was a financial backer of terror groups. (Qatar has denied this allegation.) Barrack was blindsided, one friend says. Trump’s tweet in support of the maneuver was a blow to Barrack’s credibility with his Qatari investors.After the blockade began, Barrack reached out to then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who’d done business in Qatar as CEO of Exxon Mobil Corp., to help contain the fallout. But Kushner, who’d built a relationship with MBS and backed the blockade, had more influence with Trump, according to three people familiar with the matter. A spokesman for Kushner denies that he backed the blockade. In November, MBS detained Alwaleed, Barrack’s onetime Saudi investing partner, in the Riyadh Ritz-Carlton for three months in a crackdown targeting political rivals.Former employees who worked with Barrack in the Middle East say he miscalculated. Being a Western dealmaker in Saudi Arabia was once a rare thing. Now the kingdom has relationships across Wall Street—including with Schwarzman’s Blackstone, with which it committed to invest $20 billion in 2017. Gulf royals, the former employees point out, tend not to like dealing with middlemen, which is what Barrack became when he helped secure access to the Trump administration. (Barrack never insisted on “being kept in the loop, being the middleman,” Blicksilver said.) In Kushner, MBS found his own princeling in the White House.While the Qataris haven’t said a negative word about Barrack in public, and their U.S.-based representatives say they won’t, the royal family has looked to other administration officials for support and hired opposition researchers who are looking into Barrack’s dealings with Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E., according to three people familiar with the matter. Barrack still speaks with HBJ on a regular basis, Barrack’s friends say, and Blicksilver said his relationship with the Qatari royal family remains unchanged.Barrack helped arrange an April 2018 meeting between Trump and Qatar’s new emir, 38-year-old Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, to whom Barrack had sold the Paris Saint-Germain soccer club in 2012. For Qatar, it represented a welcome, if belated, softening of the president’s stance. A month later, Barrack flew to Doha to meet with Tamim and talk investments, according to one person familiar with the meeting. No deals have been announced. On the other side of the blockade, Abu Dhabi bought a $70 million stake in a Los Angeles office tower partly owned by Colony, and the firm teamed up with the Saudi wealth fund to buy assets from France’s Accor SA. But Colony had owned a stake in Accor for years, so it hardly counts as new business.As for Saudi Arabia, there may not be many more deals on offer. In August the kingdom postponed the public offering for Aramco, raising questions about how much investment will be coming from the country. MBS has become a toxic figure, tarnished by the October death of Saudi journalist and royal family critic Jamal Khashoggi inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. Saudi Arabia has denied MBS’s involvement; nevertheless, executives including Schwarzman and JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Jamie Dimon, as well as the CEOs of Uber, Viacom, and HP, pulled out of this year’s Future Investment Initiative conference, held the last week of October. Barrack, who attended the first Future Investment Initiative conference in 2017, backed out a few days before the gathering. He made his move after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, with whom he’d been scheduled to appear on a panel, said he wouldn’t attend.For all of the loyalty and largesse Barrack bestowed on Trump since the campaign began, the Colony founder has gotten little in return. Friends say he expressed interest in being named a presidential envoy to the Middle East, which would have given him a broad mandate to shape policy. Instead, he was handed the inaugural committee—a job he likened to being a wedding planner, according to two people who say they heard the remark.Barrack’s ties to the campaign may come back to haunt him. Special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation inched closer to Barrack’s orbit with Manafort’s and Gates’s guilty pleas. Sam Patten, another Manafort associate, admitted to helping a Ukrainian oligarch disguise a $50,000 contribution to the inaugural committee in exchange for tickets. Three people close to Barrack say the committee didn’t have the tools to vet donors and that Barrack had no way of knowing the provenance of the funds. Barrack, who submitted to an interview by Mueller’s staff, “did so voluntarily, without a proffer or other agreement,” according to Blicksilver. Barrack hasn’t been accused of wrongdoing.While Barrack’s be-nice-to-all style might be out of vogue in the era of Trump and MBS, friends say not to count him out. Figueras, the polo player, sees no sign that Colony’s reversal of fortune is weighing on him. “He never complains about anything,” Figueras says, adding that Barrack has told him he’ll be spending more time in South America. Colony is negotiating a deal to obtain the Latin American business of the Abraaj Group, a failing Dubai-based investment firm. Barrack has also raised $4 billion for a new Colony fund to invest in digital infrastructure such as cell towers and data centers.Late last year, Barrack started spending more time in Colony’s offices and fewer hours on TV. He’s looking for opportunities to sell assets while boosting the fund management business. His relationships with sovereign wealth funds will be key.“I am 100 percent focused,” Barrack told investors in March. “I am still one of the largest personal shareholders in this company, it’s the majority of my personal net worth, it’s the dominant factor in my and my family’s pride, reputation, and future, and I don’t intend to leave it tainted or unattended.” —With Shannon Pettypiece, Heather Perlberg, and Mohammed Aly Sergie '),\n",

       "  '2018-10-05',\n",
       "  'Aardvark strawLast fall, Porchlight, a Southern-themed cocktail lounge in New York City operated by the Union Square Hospitality Group, decided to ditch plastic straws. So Mark Maynard, the bar’s director of operations, decided his staff would test some eco-friendly alternatives. They placed 20 different paper straws in glasses of water. The one from Aardvark, the only company that makes paper straws commercially in the U.S., was the standout, he says. It held together better than the rest for well over an hour.Offering Aardvark’s straws at Porchlight took a little longer than expected. When the bar’s procurement office contacted the Fort Wayne, Ind., company to place an order, it was told the wait time could be as long as three months. “They said, ‘We’re sorry. A lot of people have jumped on board recently,’\\u2009” Maynard says.Aardvark got back into the business of making straws in 2007—its roots are in a company dating to 1888 that invented the paper straw—largely because of a growing anti-plastic movement and increasing demand for eco-friendly products. Several companies, including Walt Disney Co. and the Ted’s Montana Grill restaurants founded by Ted Turner, reached out to Aardvark that year, asking if it might again make the paper straws it was once known for, according to David Rhodes, the company’s global business director. More than 30 years after the onslaught of plastic put an end to that part of its business, Aardvark reengineered its process, refined the paper and the glues used in manufacturing, and issued a basic white straw.The business started doubling every year, according to Rhodes. Aardvark was making millions of the product annually—and introducing innovations along the way, such as different sizes and designs and safe colors. What the company hadn’t foreseen was how fast demand would rise. “In 2017 to 2018, it went from double to 50 times the business,” Rhodes says, “Most businesses would have a hard time reacting to that.”In the spring of this year, Aardvark decided to seek an investor to help it increase capacity. “We didn’t have the resources to grow to the level that we needed to be,” Rhodes says. After approaching several companies, it was acquired on Aug. 6 by Hoffmaster Group Inc., a 71-year-old Oshkosh, Wis.-based manufacturer of disposable kitchen goods. Hoffmaster had been an Aardvark customer and knew about its straws. “Over the past nine years, Aardvark developed the best blend of paper that would be compostable but hold up against liquid,” says Andy Romjue, president of Hoffmaster’s food service division. Hoffmaster also makes paper products, potentially a source of engineering know-how for Aardvark.“Our short-term objective is, by January or February 2019, to have seven times the production capacity we had when we took over,” says Romjue. Rhodes says the company produces millions of straws per day.Making paper straws is relatively simple. Large sheets are slit to narrow widths, then wound in spirals around long, skinny tubes to create the shape. There are options for specialty straws, from custom designs to extra-wide ones for shakes. Aardvark’s challenge is making more, faster, and of the same high quality. The Hoffmaster investment is mostly focused on equipment to boost output, as well as expanding facilities and hiring more workers. Aardvark had started ramping up production even before the deal because of the time it takes to have equipment running at full capacity. “It takes a few months to build a piece of equipment”—Aardvark makes its own—“and to train the operators, who function more as artisans,” Rhodes says.Most of the process is secret, and the company operates a closed plant. It’s also a sustainable business, Rhodes says. The paper is sourced from sustainable forests grown for specific purposes, such as making straws, to avoid deforestation and to provide the greenest substitute for plastic. “If you’re trying to eliminate single-use plastics that get into waterways and get into the ocean, the plastic straw to paper straw movement is the gateway,” he says. “It’s a sustainable option that’s relatively easy and, at only a penny more than plastic per straw, economically viable.” Plastic straws cost about half a cent each, Rhodes adds.The company isn’t too worried about competition, despite the threat of China. That country’s paper straws are the ones that have given the drinking implement such a bad rap, he says. “Making a good paper straw isn’t easy,” Rhodes says. Also, building an operation to rival Aardvark’s can’t happen overnight. “It takes awhile to develop a sustainable and green business like this,” he says. “You have to get compostability and biodegradability testing and then certification” from the Food and Drug Administration.The company’s biggest customers are theme parks and major restaurant chains, including McDonald’s Corp. and Disney. “Everybody who has made claims about transitions—restaurants, coffee shops—we are in conversations about servicing them,” says Romjue. “But as each new municipality puts laws in place, we shift to help folks in need. If you can’t have plastic straws in Seattle, we’ll prioritize that over Nebraska.”However much Aardvark increases its output, Rhodes cautions that the switch to paper takes more time than many businesses realize. “We try to work with new customers and prospective buyers and tell them to be mindful that they can’t just turn this on,” he says. “In the 1960s, when the plastics industry came in to the business, it took them almost a decade to build out the structure to move Americans away from paper straws.”'),\n",

       "  '2018-10-04',\n",
       "  'Sony, Warner Bros., and Lions Gate are forced to fight back with lucrative counteroffers.Peter Roth knew it was time to take out his checkbook. Roth, the head of Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc.’s TV studio, had just watched Netflix Inc. lure top producers from several rivals by offering them more money than they’d ever made before. Ryan Murphy, the creator of American Horror Story, left 21st Century Fox Inc. for a deal worth at least $240 million. Shonda Rhimes, the showrunner of Grey’s Anatomy, left Walt Disney Co. for at least $150 million. Roth was determined not to let Greg Berlanti, one of his own star producers, do the same.The prolific Berlanti has 15 shows on the air, the most of any TV producer in history, including several adaptations of DC Comics franchises such as Supergirl and Arrow that appeal to tweens and young women. He’s particularly valuable to Warner Bros., which owns DC as well as half of the CW Television Network, where many of its shows air. Of the 12 series that will run in prime time on the CW this fall, Berlanti is an executive producer of seven.So with two years before Berlanti’s contract was set to expire, Roth offered the 46-year-old a contract worth at least $400 million to stay at Warner Bros. through 2024. Berlanti and Roth both declined to comment on the deal, believed to be one of the most lucrative for a TV producer in the history of Hollywood, according to interviews with more than a dozen executives, agents, and producers. It’s also a sign of how traditional studios, tired of losing their best people to Netflix, are fighting back. Warner Bros. bought out Berlanti’s rights to future profits on all his current shows, what’s known as the back end, a structure that allowed it to offer him more money upfront than he would have otherwise received.Roth has set a template others have followed. Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. is nearing an exclusive movie and TV deal with comedy producers Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg—outmaneuvering Netflix and Amazon.com Inc.—using a similar approach. And Disney, once it concludes its acquisition of Fox, will turn its attention to securing soon-to-be free agents such as Family Guy producer Seth MacFarlane and Modern Family creator Steven Levitan.“There is a lot of crazy stuff happening in the market today, and there is an aggressive dividing line between what is now considered old media companies and new media companies,” says Joe Cohen, a talent representative at Creative Artists Agency who negotiated Murphy’s deal with Netflix.Netflix’s Hollywood raid started with Rhimes, the creator of Scandal and Grey’s Anatomy. The company offered her the biggest deal of her career to leave ABC and produce programs exclusively for the streaming service. Rhimes jumped at the chance to free herself from the limitations of broadcast TV—where overt politics, nudity, and swear words are all prohibited.The deal upended the economics of the industry. Producers used to own a piece of their shows outright, potentially reaping hundreds of millions of dollars by selling the rights to reruns. Tom Werner, for instance, made enough money from The Cosby Show and Roseanne to buy the Boston Red Sox and Liverpool Football Club. There’s no back end on Netflix, which releases shows all over the world at the same time, and runs the programs indefinitely. “You get more upfront with less risk, but potentially less upside in success,” says Chris Silbermann, Rhimes’s agent at ICM Partners.Still, deals such as Murphy’s and Rhimes’s are outliers, says Silbermann. There are only a handful of producers who can—or even want to—produce multiple shows at the same time. Rhimes has already announced eight different projects she’s undertaking for Netflix, while Murphy has a half dozen shows in production. For creators who just want to do one at a time, Netflix may not be the best home, since it doesn’t provide as much hand-holding for individual projects. While Netflix provides money and artistic freedom, networks such as Home Box Office Inc. claim to provide more support every step of the way—from notes on early scripts to fine-tuning for a pilot episode. That’s a big reason why Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan stuck with Sony Pictures when his contract came up for renegotiation earlier this year, according to people familiar with his decision.Rogen and Goldberg, producers of the movies Neighbors and Sausage Party, were wooed by Amazon and Netflix but wanted a studio that would give their movies a big push in theaters. Previously with Sony, they’re now talking to Lions Gate and executives there who initially helped them get their business off the ground.Many producers fear their programs can get lost amid all the clutter on Netflix and wonder if their shows might get a bigger boost from the weekly rollout of traditional TV. Actor and writer Jason Segel, who starred for nine seasons in the CBS hit comedy How I Met Your Mother, specifically wanted his new show, Dispatches from Elsewhere, to air on conventional TV so it could benefit from the added attention paid to new episodes each week.Some producers see HBO as the epitome of quality, where programs are treated more as art than commerce. Buffy the Vampire Slayer creator Joss Whedon recently signed with HBO over Netflix for his new TV series. “The increased volume at other places has worked in our favor,” says Casey Bloys, the head of programming at HBO.'),\n",

Chief Executive Officer Brian Roberts was in a London taxi when he started chatting with the driver, who “was incredibly knowledgeable about the difference between Virgin and Sky in every feature,” Roberts told reporters earlier this year, referring to Britain’s pay-TV rivals. “We were learning a lot there.”Sky’s surprisingly strong connection to U.K. customers, as demonstrated by the cab driver, helped convince Roberts that the European company was worth a princely sum. Over the weekend, Comcast outbid 21st Century Fox Inc. in an auction for control of Sky Plc—a satellite-TV company with a TV studio and valuable sports rights, including Premier League soccer. Its winning bid: $39 billion, more than double what media investors estimated the company was worth when it went on the block in 2016.Many investors don’t share Roberts’s vision, and on Sept. 24, Comcast’s shares fell as much as 8 percent as Wall Street worried that its global expansion will cost too much. “They grossly overpaid,” says Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson LLC.The Sky deal would propel Comcast’s debt to at least $100 billion, placing the company among a small group that have borrowed that much, including AT&T Inc., which in June closed on its $85 billion purchase of Time Warner Inc. The debt could go even higher now that Fox on Sept. 26 said it will sell Comcast its 39 percent stake in Sky, worth more than $15 billion—a decision that required approval from Walt Disney Co., which is buying most of Fox.Comcast executives say they’re confident they can generate enough cash flow to pay down their debt over time. For now, the company’s credit ratings are unchanged, though an S&P Global Ratings analyst has given it a negative outlook. But the success of the deal depends on continued strength at its U.S. business and the combined TV giants fending off the global rise of streaming rivals Netflix Inc. and Amazon.com Inc.Comcast, which has been losing thousands of U.S. cable-TV customers, is staking its future on high-speed internet service. Internet subscriptions are still growing, but if AT&T and Verizon Communications Inc. can deliver ultrafast wireless service, they could make Comcast broadband irrelevant.The company also owns NBCUniversal, a collection of broadcast and cable channels, a film and TV studio, and theme parks. By owning both TV programs and the pipes that deliver them to homes, Comcast has created a hedge in a fast-changing landscape where it’s uncertain whether content makers or distributors are better positioned.Sky is essentially Comcast’s European twin, with about 23 million customers, mostly in the U.K. and Ireland. With Sky, the U.S. company would almost double its customer base. Like Comcast and its X1, Sky sells a box called Sky Q, which has a slick interface that makes it easier to find what to watch—and provides a rich source of data on customer viewing habits. Unlike Comcast, Sky is still gaining video customers.The two companies could benefit from being under the same roof. For instance, Comcast and Sky could have their studios team up to create more original TV shows for Sky’s online service. That could provide a bulwark against the rise of Netflix, Amazon, and Home Box Office Inc., which are spending billions of dollars in a global race for online TV customers, especially in Europe. Perhaps most important, as more Americans drop their cable-TV subscriptions, Sky offers Comcast a foothold on a continent where cord-cutting hasn’t taken off yet.“The industry changed under Brian’s feet, and he reacted to it,” says Leo Hindery, managing partner of InterMedia Partners LP and former CEO of cable giant TeleCommunications Inc., which was sold to AT&T. “He saw some weakness in his hand here and said, ‘Where do I go next?’ There’s no big play for him in Asia or Latin America. The only other place he could go is Europe.”Globe-trotting is fairly new for Comcast, which built its business by acquiring regional franchises that had extended cable into parts of the U.S. far removed from urban centers. Gain control of a remote system, then defend it; that was the business. But by the time Roberts became president of Comcast in 1990, satellite TV was jeopardizing cable’s dominance in the American living room. Now an even greater threat is coming from deep-pocketed tech companies that are invading Hollywood, stealing talented producers, and siphoning away TV customers with a strong library of online entertainment at a cheaper price.When Comcast gains control of Sky, one of its first tasks will be introducing itself to European consumers who’ve never heard of it, according to Alice Enders, head of research at Enders Analysis. “The brand isn’t familiar to people here at all,” says Enders, who’s based in London. “People are still wondering, Who is this company?”That fresh start could be an advantage for Comcast, whose reputation in the U.S. has been damaged by its history of frustrating customer service. It’s expected to continue using the Sky brand name, so consumers may never notice the new American overlord. Roberts has also tried to ease concerns in Europe by pledging to preserve Sky News’s independence. On a February call with analysts, he even offered an olive branch to Anglophiles by mentioning how a Comcast studio had produced the popular British TV series Downton Abbey.Recently, Roberts has also tried to clear up misunderstandings on Wall Street, explaining that buying Sky—and his failed pursuit of Fox’s assets—doesn’t mean he’s soured on Comcast’s core business in the U.S. “Any deals we’re doing, we’re trying to play offense in a belief that we, over the long term, can create exceptional shareholder value,” he said at a conference in September. “Sometimes that’s hard to prove on Day 1. Over time, we hope we can do so.”'),\n",

       "  '2018-09-13',\n",
       "  'While Alphabet faces existential challenges, its co-founder is exercising his right to be forgotten.Larry Page was a no-show. The co-founder and de facto leader of Google is famous for his wild bets on airborne taxis and space elevators, but he apparently couldn’t make the flight to Washington, D.C. Page had been called to testify on Capitol Hill, alongside Twitter Chief Executive Officer Jack Dorsey and Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, about the ways state-sponsored actors have exploited their platforms. Page spurned the request. When the hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee began on Sept. 5, a black leather chair reserved for him sat empty next to Dorsey and Sandberg. A place card marked “Google,” in front of a blank notepad and muted microphone, served as a blunt reminder of his absence. As senator after senator tore into the company for skipping the hearing, they often directed their ire to the void where Page would have sat, with Florida’s Marco Rubio labeling the snub “arrogant” and fellow Republican Susan Collins of Maine calling it an “outrage.” News cameras panned to the unoccupied seat.Two decades after Page co-founded Google, his company is entering arguably its most perilous phase. Yes, its revenue continues to boom. And yes, that means self-driving car unit Waymo and all the “other bets”—the eclectic mix of subsidiaries reorganized a few years ago under a new parent, Alphabet Inc.—have all the resources they need to hunt for blockbuster breakthroughs. It’s the unceasing growth of Google’s flagship properties that’s become its greatest liability. Detractors around the globe are demanding a breakup of its market-ruling search ad business. The European Union fined the company $5.1 billion this summer in an antitrust case over the dominance of Google’s Android mobile operating system. And U.S. lawmakers, given Russian-backed manipulation of Google’s platforms in the 2016 presidential election, are exploring avenues to regulate YouTube. With so many challenges clouding Alphabet’s future, it was more than a little surprising that Page and company left the chair empty at the high-profile hearing. Sundar Pichai, who became head of Google after Page removed himself to run Alphabet, also declined to fill the spot. “I don’t get it,” Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia who’s called on Page to answer for Google’s harmful effects, said in an interview with Bloomberg TV. “It’s going to hurt their reputation, not just with the policymakers but with a whole lot of Google users. What do they have to hide?”It’s not just Washington. Even in Silicon Valley, people have started wondering: Where’s Larry? Page has long been reclusive, a computer scientist who pondered technical problems away from the public eye, preferring to chase moonshots over magazine covers. Unlike founder-CEO peers (Mark Zuckerberg comes to mind), he hasn’t presented at product launches or on earnings calls since 2013, and he hasn’t done press since 2015. He leaves day-to-day decisions to Pichai and a handful of advisers. But a slew of interviews in recent months with colleagues and confidants, most of whom spoke on condition of anonymity because they were worried about retribution from Alphabet, describe Page as an executive who’s more withdrawn than ever, bordering on emeritus, invisible to wide swaths of the company. Supporters contend he’s still engaged, but his immersion in the technology solutions of tomorrow has distracted him from the problems Google faces today. “What I didn’t see in the last year was a strong central voice about how [Google’s] going to operate on these issues that are societal and less technical,” says a longtime executive who recently left the company.Until the Senate hearing, Google had ducked much of the scorn heaped on the social media behemoths, especially Facebook Inc. Yet Google, more than any other tech company, set us on this path to unprecedented data mining and a world in which corporations track us online and off. The search engine emerged from the dot-com bust with the smartest game plan, creating a business model where every interaction with its software fed its computing brain and bottom line. Page didn’t start Google for this reason—he saw revenue generation as a means to work on advances such as artificial intelligence—yet his success paved the way for a system where every user’s interests and location can be targeted with alarming precision. “Google has been incredibly lucky to date that Facebook’s failures have been so much more in focus, but they’re every bit as bad,” says Roger McNamee, an early Google and Facebook investor turned vocal critic of both. “By not showing up, it did Facebook a huge favor. If you’re a shareholder, you should be furious. They guaranteed the intensity will go way up.”Alphabet said in a statement that it had offered its head of global affairs for the hearing and that “enabling Larry to focus on the other bets and long-term technical problems is exactly what Alphabet was set up for.” The company referred questions to Dan Doctoroff, head of its urban infrastructure unit, Sidewalk Labs, and former CEO of Bloomberg LP, Bloomberg Businessweek’s parent. Doctoroff declined to comment on whether Page has a responsibility to speak publicly about Google’s more pressing challenges and says they haven’t spoken about the issues stemming from the Senate hearings.In the past, Page’s quiet approach earned him plaudits and a beneficent image as Alphabet’s chief visionary, but his distance of late raises doubts over who exactly will steer Google through this existential crisis. Twitter Inc.’s Dorsey and Facebook’s Zuckerberg, who’d previously testified before Congress, have apologized repeatedly for the unintended consequences of their networks and sworn that fixing them is their top priority. Page, meanwhile, hasn’t offered a statement of contrition nor publicly indicated his plans to address the threats facing his company. The question now is whether he has a responsibility—to shareholders, staff, society—to get back on stage.\\n What’s occupying Page’s time today? People who know him say he’s disappearing more frequently to his private, white-sand Caribbean island. That’s not to imply that, at 45, he’s already living the daiquiri lifestyle. He still oversees each Alphabet subsidiary, though the extent of his involvement is vague. Along with Google co-founder Sergey Brin, who’s now Alphabet’s president, Page even occasionally holds court at the company’s weekly all-hands “TGIF” meetings at its Mountain View, Calif., headquarters. He sometimes fields questions from employees, though he mostly defers to Pichai and other corporate leaders, according to current Googlers. Page has reached a point where he takes on only rare projects that deeply fascinate him, like the sci-fi pursuits at X, Alphabet’s secretive research lab.When Page, Google’s first CEO, reclaimed the top job from Eric Schmidt in 2011, he approached it as if it were an engineering puzzle. He worked 80-hour weeks, devoured business leadership books, and studied his managerial idols, such as Bill Campbell and Warren Buffett. Yet he grew tired of the tedium of overseeing operations, his mind geared more for R&D than P&L. According to the recently departed executive, Page’s eyes would “glaze over” in meetings when discussions turned away from core technologies to the humdrum of business. “What you do is boring,” this person recalls Page saying when a conversation strayed too far from a topic that interested him. He was also averse to the internal politics common to running a 60,000-employee conglomerate. A former senior director at Google remembers a heated debate among the “L Team,” as Googlers used to call Page’s circle of executive consiglieri, that escalated to a point where it required his mediation. “Can’t you sort this out on your own?” he told his deputies.While Page’s tenure was marked by prescient investments in AI and massive facilities to store Google’s growing data hoard, the pace of the job also weighed on his health, say two former Google VPs. In the 1990s he was diagnosed with vocal cord paralysis, a nerve condition that eventually has made it difficult for him to speak above a hoarse whisper. “Sergey says I’m probably a better CEO because I choose my words more carefully,” Page wrote in a Google+ post in 2013, the same year he stopped joining earnings calls. A person who formerly reported to him even recalls being scolded for once making a mistake that led the CEO to yell, as if Page had only so many words left to speak.The company’s abrupt reorganization in 2015 elevated Pichai to CEO of Google and Page to chief of its umbrella company, Alphabet. It was perhaps the cleverest retirement plan ever devised: He was able to retain control of his creation while passing off most of the responsibilities, leaving him more freedom to focus on what he has called “crazy” and “speculative” bets on the future. Page has personally funded three companies aiming to pioneer autonomous flying vehicles and obsessed over Alphabet’s various robotics groups. For several months he maintained a weekly meeting with leaders at Google Fiber, a project to develop ultrahigh-speed internet access, to brainstorm technical solutions for implementing the service, such as newfangled ways to drill fiber-optic cables into sidewalks, says a former manager there.Another skunkworks project that consumed Page, started in 2015 and previously unreported, was a Disney-esque idea to reimagine transportation, code-named Heliox. According to three people familiar with the effort, a team operating out of a former NASA hangar in the Bay Area built a tube of plastic the width of a subway car, snaked around a circular track, designed to propel bicyclists at rapid speeds through a swirl of oxygen and helium pumped into the tunnel at their backs. Heliox was pure Page, a space-age concept both preposterously imaginative and mechanically marvelous: The vision was to stretch this tube system, arced hundreds of feet in the air, from a ground-level entry point on Google’s Mountain View campus to an exit 35 miles north, in San Francisco, so Google’s rainbow-colored beach cruisers might one day be seen flying over U.S. Highway 101. Yes, it sounds like a Hyperloop for bikes.Many of these projects, including Heliox, have since fizzled or died. As Alphabet’s CEO, Page had to placate investors anxious about his investments beyond Google’s core business. Now almost all of Alphabet’s spending goes to Google. Several people familiar with the dynamic say Page’s involvement with Alphabet’s subsidiaries has become more sporadic in recent years as the L Team has shrunk to a smaller coterie known as “AlphaFun,” and it’s difficult to pinpoint a fresh project inside the company with his clear imprint. One former manager who worked at X says the rare office check-in from Page is akin to a royal visit, replete with assistants, hangers-on, and advance fretting. Doctoroff, the Sidewalk Labs CEO, disputes this characterization and says Page is “intensely involved,” citing their weekly video chats and a surprise Page visit to Sidewalk’s Toronto project in July. Although Page hasn’t visited Sidewalk’s New York headquarters in months, Doctoroff says he’s constantly discussing ideas as varied as “dynamic pavement” and “cross-laminated timber.”These days, there’s a sense within Google that futurism has taken a back seat to more pressing concerns. The company long had a public face in Schmidt, who happily defended it against Congress and critics until he stepped down as executive chairman in January. During key moments over the past two years, such as the protests of President Trump’s 2017 immigration ban and this spring’s internal upheaval over Google’s jockeying for AI contracts with the Pentagon, it was Pichai and Brin, not Page, who spoke to employees.It’s a weird moment for founder-CEOs, and compared with Elon Musk smoking a blunt on a live video podcast, Page’s invisibility might seem preferable. According to one Larry loyalist, Page’s privacy, besides being a personal preference, is also a carefully considered company strategy. When Google ballooned in the late 2000s, pushing into every new business it could think of as its share of the U.S. search market rocketed toward 70 percent, some inside the company deemed it shrewd to temper Page’s outward persona. They were conscious of the way Bill Gates had become a media caricature during Microsoft Corp.’s three-year antitrust lawsuit and didn’t want Page to become a similar corporate mascot-slash-punching bag.At this point, though, such a public-relations strategy feels dated. On balance, the celebrity of even the most caricatured CEO (Zuckerberg) appears to be a net positive for his company. Page’s counterparts may not own the narrative around their companies right now, but speaking up is helping them shape it.In Page’s absence at the Senate hearing, louder voices filled the void, from senators criticizing Google for its dealings with China to pundits decrying Page as unpatriotic. McNamee, the early investor who’s since advocated for the company’s breakup, says Page and Pichai shirked their civic duty by skipping the hearing. “This is Corporate Governance 101,” he says. “You’ve been invited to speak in front of a Senate hearing to protect our democracy, and your response is, ‘We’re too important to go’? The whole world is looking at them: ‘What the hell is wrong with you people? Who are you?’\\u200a”It’s strange how such denunciations can distort Page’s image as a friendly futurist. Even his semiretirement, perhaps colored by his health issues, conjures visions of a frail and aging luminary, so much so that it’s easy to forget that he’s younger than his successor, Pichai. At one of his last public appearances, in an onstage conversation at TED in 2014, Page looked astonishingly young and upbeat. His voice had already grown hushed, but the rasps between his deep breaths lent gravity to his discussion of the ways in which technology can hurt people and data can be misused. Although he was speaking to the Silicon Valley spying revealed by Edward Snowden, he could just as well have been ruminating about the challenges facing Alphabet and Google today when he reflected on how the public needs to reevaluate government powers in the digital age. “We haven’t had that conversation,” he said. “We need to have a debate about that, or we can’t have a functioning democracy.”To have a debate, though, you need to show up.

       "  'Illustration: Viktor HachmangThe company behind the art fair claims it can replicate what it did for Miami all around the world. The first attempt? Cash-strapped Buenos Aires.After Diego Radivoy’s first visit to Art Basel Miami Beach in 2004, he was hooked. A Buenos Aires resident, Radivoy originally traveled to the art fair as a member of a museum acquisition committee. But the art, parties, people, and culture brought him back the next year, and then the next.Over time, Radivoy noticed a change. When he started attending, much of Miami was relatively seedy. Yet in a few years, unsafe neighborhoods such as Wynwood became “a place where everyone was walking freely and enjoying it,” he says. “The same thing happened to the whole city: It was a very powerful transformation.” To his eye, Art Basel was the catalyst for that shift. “It provided an art and culture identity to the city,” he says.In 2015, Radivoy was appointed general director of creative industries for the Buenos Aires municipal government. When Art Basel announced an initiative called Art Basel Cities the following March, he and the mayor of Buenos Aires, Horacio Rodríguez Larreta, saw a chance to effect a Miami-like transformation of their hometown.The Cities project was conceived as a form of cultural consulting by Art Basel, the multicity art fair business that’s owned by Swiss MCH Group AG. In a press release, it stated that the organization “will use its expertise, network, and communication channels to support cities in developing their individual cultural landscape.”At the time, Buenos Aires and the nation as a whole were slowly reemerging on the international stage after more than a decade of hostility to foreign investors and populist policies championed by Argentine presidents (and spouses) Néstor and Cristina Kirchner. “I said, ‘This is what we need,’\\u2009” says Radivoy. “And I think we are what they need.”Art Basel Cities: Buenos Aires officially kicked off in November 2017, with a talks program and a “matchmaking service” that linked people in Buenos Aires to various figures in the international art world. On Sept. 6, the first Cities Week opened. It included installations and live performances by 18 artists in a “citywide exhibition” that featured attractions ranging from free studio tours to a wandering troupe of masked flutists performing in a botanical garden. The week had a “cultural partner” list that counted almost every arts organization in the city, including its modern art museum and multiple public parks. “I must say,” Radivoy says, “that we noticed the impact immediately. We saw a lot of people calling us saying, ‘I want to do a pop-up gallery in your city.’\\u2009”Whether the impact can scale beyond a few regional galleries is an open question. Art Basel Cities is a novel concept, but it’s also the most recent iteration of a 20-year attempt to jump-start civic economies through cultural investment.Arguably the first and most successful example of this phenomenon was the 1997 opening of the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, designed by Frank Gehry, which revitalized the Spanish city’s economy. Walt Disney Concert Hall, another Gehry building, is credited with spurring a revival of downtown Los Angeles. And though Oslo wasn’t exactly languishing when its sleek, $750 million opera house with “walkable roof” opened in 2008, the structure immediately became one of the city’s top tourist attractions.Other cultural projects have proved less fruitful. “The Bilbao Effect has been oversimplified worldwide,” says Beatriz Plaza, a professor of urban economics at Spain’s University of the Basque Country. “It’s nothing if it’s [executed] in a copy-paste manner. You have to know what the real economic base of the city is.” As Argentina spirals into a currency crisis, that base looks increasingly wobbly.Historically, museums in cities and towns were designed explicitly for residents of those places. As hundreds of museums popped up across America at the beginning of the 20th century, they were meant to infuse culture, class, and worldliness in those cities. In essence, they were a form of national self-betterment, not tourist attractions. “Through the 19th and 20th centuries, the museum movement is driven within the framework of the nation-state,” says Gordon Fyfe, an honorary senior lecturer at Keele University in the U.K. who specializes in museum sociology.All that changed with the Guggenheim Bilbao. It was such a hit, Plaza says, that the city recovered its $228 million investment 10 to 15 years after the museum opened. “That’s totally unusual,” she says. “France generally budgets 50 years” to recoup what it spends on cultural institutions.The so-called Bilbao Effect started a cascade of architecturally ambitious, often financially burdensome initiatives around the world. A Santiago Calatrava-designed addition to the Milwaukee Art Museum, which was completed in 2001, cost $130 million. As benefactors scrambled to cover its costs, the two main buildings in the complex languished. The problem was, the Bilbao Effect didn’t ever quite become the Denver Effect, or the Guangzhou Effect, or the Valencia Effect, even as those cities spent millions, or billions, of dollars on arts institutions.This cultural building boom came to an end about a decade ago, when austerity measures began taking effect in countries large and small. But the perception of culture as an economic driver remained.“When I started at Art Basel 11 years ago, I became used to getting a phone call every month from a different random city saying, ‘We want you to bring Art Basel to [us],’\\u2009” says Marc Spiegler, the global director of Art Basel. “Everyone from San Diego to Shanghai. At one point there were two different parts of Shanghai that were pushing to bring Art Basel to them.”A fair wasn’t in the cards. “Our initial reaction was thanks but no thanks,” Spiegler says. “These people were for the most part not art collectors or arts patrons. They were simply people who wanted their city to be economically more powerful. They don’t want a fair, they want the impact that a fair has.”That, Spiegler reasoned, was relatively easy to provide. There are three Art Basel fairs a year: in Basel, Miami, and Hong Kong. Through its VIP relations outreach, the organization has an impressive Rolodex of collectors, curators, artists, and art dealers. If they can be marshaled to show up in droves to a sleepy city in Switzerland, Spiegler thought, they could be tempted by any other city in the world.So, working with a team of consultants, he tasked Art Basel’s head of business initiatives, Patrick Foret, to organize a proposal that became the genesis of Art Basel Cities. “In one city we could imagine that culture tourism would be the focus,” Spiegler says. “In another Art Basel City, development would be the focus. Depending on the city and its overall strategy of economic development, we’d be able to help them do different things.”Art Basel declines to reveal how much its efforts will cost Buenos Aires, other than to say it’s in the millions of dollars. Radivoy says much of the money for Art Basel Cities comes from existing funding for the arts. “As a city, you have a budget to work with, and if you already have money [allocated] to do a mural and Art Basel comes and says, ‘We can get Barbara Kruger to do a big mural for the same price,’ then it’s no extra cost to the city,” he says.However much Buenos Aires spends, it will be less than what it would cost to erect a glamorous, starchitect-designed building. But will it pay off? Collectors, after all, come to art fairs so they can buy art, not to see flute performances. And galleries attending the fairs do their own outreach to induce collectors to show up. The global mega-galleries weren’t in Buenos Aires, so organizers had to use their own resources to get affluent buyers to trek to tour local studios. Early tallies suggest international attendance was in the hundreds.Radivoy acknowledges that these are concerns—“there are no guarantees”—but brushes aside skepticism about the project. First, he says, Buenos Aires is already a cultural destination; unlike, say, Sacramento, it has an existing art, architecture, and culture network that will prove a powerful draw. There’s the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, which has works by Rembrandt, Monet, and Van Gogh; a massive opera house, the Teatro Colón, which has become an icon for culture in the city; and the Faena Arts Center, a renovated flour mill filled with slick contemporary art.Second, he says, art collectors might not have had a specific art fair to attend, but the city’s artists and galleries pulled out all the stops. “There is a very good profit opportunity to buy Argentinian art, because the prices are going to rise in the next years,” he says. There are many famous contemporary Argentine artists—Tomás Saraceno and Adrián Villar Rojas are two prominent examples—and with a stumbling currency, deals can be found.Finally, Radivoy says, there’s an incalculable reputational impact to consider. “We’re trying to open the whole continent to the world,” he says. “Having a city in South America that receives a lot of international visitors, institutions, collectors, and artists every year—that’s an amazing opportunity.” '),\n",

       "  '2018-09-10',\n",
       "  'Redstone in 2017.After watching her father buy and sell more than a half-dozen companies over several decades, Shari Redstone has seized the opportunity to forge her own reputation as a media baron.Redstone neutralized the threat to her family’s control over CBS Corp. this past weekend by settling a legal fight with the broadcaster’s board. At the same time, the ouster of longtime Chief Executive Officer Les Moonves -- who resigned over accusations of sexual harassment by a dozen women, including allegations of assault -- eliminated a key foe and gives Redstone a chance to pick a new leader.Data: Compiled by BloombergWith Moonves gone, the 64-year-old Redstone is free to reshape her family’s two media companies, CBS and Viacom Inc. Having installed a loyalist atop Viacom in late 2016, Redstone will now focus on the search for a new CEO at CBS. Chances are, the choice will be more responsive to her wishes and less resistant to the big changes remaking the entertainment industry, even if that doesn’t lead to recombining the two companies as Redstone had sought.The question is whether it’s too late for CBS to attract a suitor -- a scenario many investors have been banking on. Many potential acquirers have done their deals. AT&T Inc. has completed its Time Warner takeover, Walt Disney Co. is digesting 21st Century Fox Inc., and Comcast Corp. is pursuing Sky Plc. Verizon Communications Inc., which has the resources for a big buy, has repeatedly said it’s not interested in CBS. And tech giants, once content to distribute other companies’ TV shows and movies, now make them instead.“Shari has demonstrated that she is a smart, patient and tough leader,” said Christopher Marangi, co-chief investment officer of Gabelli Funds, the second-largest owner of voting shares at both CBS and Viacom. “Although global scale is of increasing importance, CBS and Viacom each have enough opportunities to prosper as stand-alone entities in the near term.”A lawyer, Redstone sat for years on the outside looking in as her father steered CBS and Viacom from his perch atop the family’s National Amusements Inc. Since the early 1970s, the Boston-area movie-theater company has served as his vehicle to build a media empire that included Viacom, MTV, Paramount Pictures and CBS, one of the four major U.S. broadcast networks.Though she ran National Amusements’ movie theaters, Shari Redstone had a frosty relationship with her famously pugnacious and short-tempered dad. Four years ago, the elder Redstone unsuccessfully offered to buy out his daughter’s 20 percent stake in the holding company.But if the senior Redstone rode the growth of pay-TV to amass one of the world’s greatest media fortunes, it now falls to his daughter to expand it -- or cash out before it’s too late. As one of his last big acts, Redstone, now 95 and incapacitated, split CBS and Viacom into separate companies in 2006, believing it would unlock value for investors.It didn’t. Viacom shares have declined 67 percent from their peak in February 2014 as investors grew concerned about the outlook for advertising-supported cable TV networks. Viewership of MTV and Nickelodeon, the cornerstones of Viacom’s business, has sagged in recent years as young people abandoned TV for online services YouTube, Instagram and Netflix Inc.CBS has held up better, thanks in no small part to the salesmanship of Moonves. Viewership of the flagship CBS network, the most-watched in the U.S., has struggled with the rest of the TV industry, while the company has propped up its shares by selling assets, including radio stations and billboards. Its CEO has burned through almost $15 billion on share repurchases since 2011.“Moonves was the best in the business at steering investors to pretend how amazing CBS was and how the company’s long-term prospects were amazing, benefiting from all of the changes in consumer behavior that were hurting all of CBS’s peers,” BTIG analyst Rich Greenfield said in a note Monday.Neither company got much of a reward from investors after Sunday’s truce. Viacom shares rose 0.3 percent Monday while CBS declined 1.5 percent, extending its 2018 slide to 6.4 percent. CBS was down another 0.6 percent in early trading Tuesday.To his credit, Moonves has moved more aggressively online than Viacom, building streaming versions of its two main networks, CBS and Showtime. The services will surpass 8 million paying subscribers next year -- a milestone, but small relative to the market leaders.Much of the enthusiasm investors once had for traditional media companies has shifted to Silicon Valley. Facebook Inc. and Google have already swallowed the advertising business that newspapers and magazines once relied on, forcing publishers to build their own online subscriptions businesses. Facebook and Google are now targeting TV advertising dollars.Netflix and Amazon.com Inc., meanwhile, are coming for pay TV’s monthly fees. They’re investing billions of dollars annually in moving and TV programming, creating their own studios in the process. Apple Inc., the world’s most valuable company, and Google’s YouTube, aren’t far behind.Against that growing threat, most of Moonves’s peers decided to either get bigger or sell. Bob Iger, CEO of Disney, is swallowing much of Fox, the media company owned by fellow media mogul Rupert Murdoch. Jeff Bewkes, CEO of Time Warner, sold the parent of HBO and Warner Bros. to AT&T.All the while, Viacom and CBS have been embroiled in internal fights pitting management against the Redstones and National Amusements.Redstone has shown she’d like to put CBS and Viacom back together, even though the result would still be a minnow compared with today’s media giants. As part of the agreement announced Sunday, National Amusements reaffirmed that it won’t propose a merger of the companies for about two years.That doesn’t mean others can’t.Moonves’s departure and CBS’s settlement with National Amusements “opens the door a crack to what we believe ultimately could be the best outcome -- consideration of merger potential with other platform companies seeking deeper exposure to impactful content,” B. Riley FBR Inc. analyst Barton Crockett said Monday.“Verizon could reconsider CBS as a way to deepen its content presence and close a content gap with AT&T,” he said.— With assistance by Nabila Ahmed'),\n",

       "  'Governor Ricardo Rosselló is placing bets on small but potentially transformational businesses, from blockchain technology to movie production.Actor Nicolas Cage at a press conference with Governor Rosselló on April 17, 2018.SOURCE: SPLASH NEWSJust months after Hurricane Maria swept through Puerto Rico, wrecking the island’s power system, demolishing or damaging one-third of its homes, and killing almost 3,000 people, Brock Pierce showed up in San Juan with a message: Blockchain is here to help.In a February speech to the Puerto Rico Investment Summit, the child actor-turned-entrepreneur talked about the island’s failing infrastructure and suboptimal food supply, implying that his expertise with the technology that underlies cryptocurrencies could address the most vexing challenges facing the U.S. territory.“Together as one, we can do great things, and everybody can win,” said Pierce, who appeared in Disney’s The Mighty Ducks and several other Hollywood movies before retiring from the business at age 17. A pair of screens flanking the stage had been projecting the word “ME” in a bold black font. The letter M slowly turned upside down to make “WE.” In short order, Governor Ricardo Rosselló established a blockchain advisory council to promote the development of the business.As Puerto Rico struggles to rebuild an economy battered by the September 2017 storm and a decade-long recession, Rosselló is putting government resources behind financial technology, medical marijuana, and movie production, among other propositions. His initiatives resemble a venture capital portfolio, in which many small bets are placed on risky but potentially transformational businesses in hopes of chancing upon the next Facebook or Google. “We want to put some of our biggest bets in some of these areas and direct incentives toward what has the greatest return,” Rosselló said in an interview on Aug. 17 in San Juan.Puerto Rico’s gross national product contracted about 7 percent in the 12 months ended June 30. But the local economy was in a shambles even before the hurricane hit. The government’s free-spending ways and easy access to Wall Street money collided with the economic downturn, triggering a $74 billion bankruptcy. Economists trace the slump to the phaseout of a federal tax provision that turned Puerto Rico into a major production hub for pharmaceuticals. During the 10-year sunset period, which ended in 2006, scores of companies left, taking thousands of high-paying jobs with them.Change in gross national product by fiscal yearData: Fiscal Plan for Puerto RicoAn influx of federal aid is expected to buoy growth to 4 percent this year, but projections by the governor’s office show it falling off sharply thereafter. That’s why Rosselló is scrambling to create new lures for investors. In July he joined timeshare mogul Keith St. Clair at the groundbreaking for a $70 million film studio, where both men donned the obligatory white hard hats and posed with shovels in front of a mound of dirt. The complex, in which St. Clair is the main investor, is going up on government-owned land, although the Rosselló administration won’t divulge what it’s charging for the 40-year lease.Filmmakers say the island is prized for its tropical outdoor settings—and tax credits of 40 percent on payments to resident crew and 20 percent to nonresident talent. (Rosselló has been trying to sweeten the deal with legislation to convert tax credits into a cash rebate, though many legislators are pushing back.) What’s been lacking, the project’s backers say, are indoor sets and editing capabilities.The governor’s office projects the 180,000-square-foot Puerto Rico Film District will create more than 1,325 direct and indirect jobs, plus 350 in the construction phase. It will have sound studios, dressing rooms, conference areas, and editing and postproduction capacity. The government said it hoped to build on the $256 million in income the industry generated in the previous 18 months. The island recently hosted film crews for The Last Thing He Wanted, a Hollywood adaptation of a Joan Didion novel starring Anne Hathaway, and Primal, in which Nicolas Cage plays a big-game hunter overseeing the capture and transport of a rare Amazonian white jaguar. At a press conference at the governor’s mansion in April, the American actor said he was “mesmerized by the beauty” of Puerto Rico.Rosselló is also trying to capitalize on the great American weed rush. Medical marijuana got off to a slow start in Puerto Rico after its legalization three years ago by executive order, because of unclear rules. But six months after taking office in January 2017, Rosselló signed a comprehensive law that firmly placed the commonwealth among 34 jurisdictions where medical cannabis is legal. Puerto Rico’s department of health this year published detailed guidelines for the industry.Rosselló, who has a Ph.D. in biomedical engineering and once founded a pharmaceutical startup, hopes to turn the island into a center for marijuana innovation, led by the University of Puerto Rico. Under a 2017 law he shepherded, the university’s researchers would get 50 percent of all administrative fines from the new industry. All told, the industry may generate as much as $18 million in tax revenue next year, according to finance ministry projections.NextGen Pharma, a local business, has spent $10 million to turn an old government building in Toa Baja, a municipality bordering San Juan, into a growing facility that houses 3,000 marijuana plants. The proprietors, who say they have more real estate for expansion across the street, play music for their weed. “A happy plant makes for a good product,” says partner Carmen Serrano.Others are weighing investments in a less glamorous variety of cannabis. Industrial hemp, which can be turned into plastics, clothing, and medicines, may soon become legal across the U.S. as part of a federal farm bill. While dozens of jurisdictions will race to profit from the change, proponents say Puerto Rico’s tropical climate will provide a longer growing season than most U.S. states.Even more ephemeral than wafting marijuana smoke is the digital technology known as blockchain, which has a diverse crowd of enthusiasts and promoters. At the February investment conference, Pierce said his blockchain comrades were already picking up and moving to Puerto Rico in significant numbers. Pierce, who resides in Puerto Rico and can often be found rambling around the streets of Old San Juan in his signature black brimmed hat and sandals, says he’d previously envisioned building a community of crypto investors on the island, but the hurricane prompted him to accelerate the timeline. Puerto Ricans aren’t universally enthusiastic about an invasion of blockchain missionaries, which some have decried as crypto-colonialism. At a forum in Rincón, Pierce seemed genuinely taken aback as he was shouted down by furious residents. “Taking advantage of our vulnerability, these saviors have come to change our lives and bring us hope,” says Alex Aguilera, a 49-year-old publicist and a vocal opponent of the movement. “This has happened many times throughout history, and each time, under the weight of these calamities, we’ve fallen back on our low self-esteem and opened the door to people like this.” Nor has Rosselló’s try-anything approach won unanimous support. He’s struggled to win backing from lawmakers for his proposed film industry incentives, even though his New Progressive Party has a majority in both chambers. That’s not deterring him, though. On Aug. 23 he was back on a dais, this time in front of a room of scientists at a conference organized by the Puerto Rico Agricultural Biotechnology Industry Association. There was no word yet on what financial inducements his government might proffer, but his pitch was vigorous. “Innovation has a critical role in the development of our economy,” he told the assembled crowd.'),\n",

       "  'CookingForNoobs host Christine invites Twitch viewers into her kitchen in real time.YouTube has become synonymous with online video and the lucrative advertising that it commands. Amazon.com Inc.’s Twitch streaming site is the go-to place for the much smaller audience of video gaming enthusiasts. Now, in a bid to grab a larger slice of the online advertising pie, Amazon has decided to aggressively broaden the programming on Twitch to take on its video rival.Amazon in recent months has been pursuing exclusive livestreaming deals with dozens of popular media companies and personalities, many with large followings on YouTube. Twitch is offering minimum guarantees of as much as a few million dollars a year, as well as a share of future advertising sales and subscription revenue, according to several people who’ve been contacted by Twitch.The company has approached everyone from lifestyle influencer Gigi Gorgeous to actor Will Smith about streaming live. While some talent has resisted a few of Amazon’s terms, such as a minimum number of hours of livestreaming per week, a few deals have closed. Tanner Braungardt, a prankster from Kansas with 4 million subscribers on YouTube, for instance, has also signed onto Twitch. And the National Basketball Association struck a deal to stream minor league games on the service. “There will be a steady drumbeat of lots of new content we’re bringing on,” says Michael Aragon, Twitch Interactive Inc.’s senior vice president of content. “We’re growing well, and that makes us an attractive destination for people looking to do new things in live, interactive entertainment.”For now, it’s a David vs. Goliath battle. YouTube, the largest advertising-supported video site in the world, has about 1.9 billion monthly viewers; Twitch gets about 15 million a day. But the Amazon unit gives creators multiple ways of making money, including paid subscriptions (a feature YouTube added in response), and offers advertisers the appeal of a live, engaged audience. Amazon, which saw its ad sales in the first quarter exceed $2 billion for the first time mostly by selling “sponsored products” slots during product searches, analysts estimate, has already become a credible contender in online advertising to Google and Facebook Inc.Data: ComScoreAt a recent staff meeting, Twitch Chief Executive Officer Emmett Shear set a target of $1 billion in ad sales for Twitch, according to three people present. That’s more than double its current sales. Twitch’s key advantage, besides being live, is its popularity among young men who tend to be resistant to ads. The average Twitch user has stopped paying for cable TV and employs technology to block advertising across the internet. But hundreds of thousands of these hard-to-reach viewers tune in daily to watch top video game streamers, such as Ninja, Twitch’s biggest star.YouTube has tried to blunt Twitch’s efforts by offering big payments to some of its top creators if they agree not to make exclusive deals with other sites. “YouTube is pretty nervous,” says Chad Stoller, chief innovation officer at media agency UM Global. YouTube declined to comment for this story.Rafi Fine, who with his brother runs some of the biggest channels on YouTube through their Fine Brothers Entertainment, has had discussions with Twitch officials about making original series. Fine says he can’t imagine abandoning YouTube, but Twitch might offer his company a better home for live programming—and more money. “Twitch has a way to be not a killer, but a competitor to what YouTube does,” he says.The vast majority of Twitch’s visitors come to watch others play video games. While e-sports are booming, many marketers still associate gaming with nerds who live in their parents’ basements. Twitch didn’t let users post videos that weren’t gaming-related when Amazon paid almost $1 billion for the company in 2014. A year later, Amazon introduced Twitch Creative, which helped nongamers such as chefs and artists to stream live. The site has since hosted livestream marathons of old episodes of Saturday Night Live and celebrity chef Julia Child, plus some live sports. There’s no better sign of Twitch’s interest in nongaming video than its popular chef streamer Christine, a 32-year-old Californian who films herself baking and cooking five days a week for a show called CookingForNoobs. Her rules: Be positive, avoid cursing, and don’t feed the trolls.“Few brands are excited about reaching an audience of hardcore gamers,” says Justin Warden, CEO of Ader Inc., a marketing agency that specializes in e-sports. “More brands are excited about working with an influencer or personality.” Ader helped Walt Disney Co. market the DVD release of Black Panther on Twitch and is signing clients who specialize in anime and card playing, plus gamers as adept at humor as a joystick.Two of the fastest-growing genres on Twitch are livestreams of TV shows and “IRL,” or in real life, videos—where posters welcome fans into their world for a few hours at a time. IRL videos are an unedited version of the video blog, or vlog, one of the dominant genres on YouTube.Few people can marshal their fans to buy books, tickets, or makeup like online influencers, the youthful vloggers and comedians who rule YouTube. So Amazon has an added incentive for wooing them to Twitch. Still, rivals have attempted to compete with YouTube for years, with little to show for it. Verizon Communications Inc. struggled to attract users to its video app Go90 before folding it this year. Facebook has pursued online creators for its Watch video section, but it isn’t yet a major source of revenue for most online talent.Yet YouTube’s grip on the creators has never been more tenuous. Its investments in new areas such as TV and music have left some creators feeling unloved. And its crackdown on which videos are eligible for ads has reduced revenue for some of its top stars. “YouTube has been confusing the creator community,” says David Tochterman, who represents creators who work with both YouTube and Twitch. YouTube’s constant tweaks to the algorithms that power its site have a big effect on views for YouTubers, who can no longer rely on the site to be their sole source of revenue, he says.Nichole Boyd started posting YouTube videos in 2010 and has about 500,000 subscribers to her channel, which features home cleaning and organization tips. YouTube advertising remains her largest revenue source, but like many influencers, she wants to cultivate other platforms so sudden changes to algorithms or rules don’t kill her business. People directed to Amazon from her YouTube posts spend as much as $60,000 a month at the online retailer, and she gets a commission on everything they buy within 24 hours of visiting Amazon through a link from her channel. “I do pretty good there because a lot of the products I have in my videos and use in my home are sold on Amazon,” she says.Amazon reached out to her earlier this year about creating two videos a week for a kind of home shopping network-style program with several other online influencers, Boyd says. She’s interested in the idea—and likely so are YouTube executives. —With Spencer Soper'),\n",

       "  'The interactive “museums” you love to hate are laughing all the way to the bank.Customers shop and take pictures in front of ice cream freezers stocked with The Pint Shop brand ice cream pints. Flavors include Cherrylicious, Vanillionare, and Nana Banana.Photographer: David Williams for Bloomberg BusinessweekAt the Museum of Ice Cream, patrons can ride in an ice cream sandwich swing, swim in a pool of plastic ice cream \\xadsprinkles, and seesaw on a giant ice cream scoop. But you already knew that. Its often sold-out installations are extensively documented on the Instagram feeds of David Beckham, Beyoncé, and the thousands of noncelebrities lucky enough to get in.Contrary to its name, the Museum of Ice Cream, a pop-up attraction now in San Francisco, isn’t a museum. It’s more like a playground with no age limit. It’s also the most visible end of a growing movement that’s blurring the line between shopping and entertainment. Rosé Mansion, which opened on July 12 in New York, is a two-story celebration of the pink drink with rooms of rose petal baths and décor resembling Champagne bubbles. Candytopia, a real-life Candy Land with a marshmallow pit and edible confection samples, opens Wednesday in New York with another Bay Area pop-up in September.Much of the debate around these selfie magnets focuses on what to call them. Are they institutions with cultural value? Or are they “braindead, Instagram-optimized fun houses,” as Jason Farago, editor of contemporary art magazine Even, put it in his newsletter? Neither, says Manish Vora, co-founder of the Museum of Ice Cream. For him it’s a new retail form, one that follows in the footsteps of such businesses as Warby Parker.Harvard Business Review coined the term “experience economy” in the late 1990s, but the concept took hold only recently. “Both new and existing companies are increasingly incorporating heavy experiential components into their business,” says Warren Teichner, a McKinsey & Co. senior partner. James Cook, \\xaddirector of retail research at investment management company JLL, sees long-term potential. “Entertainment is going to be the new anchor,” he says. “It’s going to be driving traffic to the shopping centers of the future.” (If there are any.)The formula has yielded a hearty return for the Museum of Ice Cream, which began in 2016 as a pop-up in Manhattan’s Meatpacking District. This year it surpassed 1 million visitors across its various locations. Tickets run as much as $38, and it’s received sponsorship from Dove Chocolate and American Express Co., among others.This summer the Museum of Ice Cream parlayed that viral success into a pop-up grocery in New York’s Chelsea neighborhood called the Pint Shop, which also offers ticketed tastings. It brokered a nationwide merchandising deal with Target Corp., which on July 7 began offering museum-\\xadbranded clothes and pints in flavors such as Churro Churro and Vanillionaire. “It’s in their freezers,” Vora says. “It becomes more than an Instagram feed.”The Target partnership is off to a promising start. Todd Waterbury, the chain’s chief creative officer, says retail “has always been a form of theater, of staging and story\\xadtelling, with products as cast members.”Rosé Mansion, likewise, sees a bustling business of 500 to 750 visitors every day, according to co-founder Tyler Balliet. Tickets for the event, set to run until October, are $45, with a $35 “happy hour” special on weekday afternoons. It has introduced a rosé wine club as well that delivers a package of three bottles once every three months for $54.Dream Machine, which runs in Brooklyn until Sept. 9, has sold $2 million in tickets since opening in April. A $28 matinee takes guests through a surrealist reverie, complete with Technicolor neon lights and a room built to make visitors feel as if they’re at the bottom of a giant swimming pool. Paige Solomon, Dream Machine’s co-founder, shirks a one-to-one comparison with existing institutions. “I actually think it’s a crime to call these pop-ups ‘\\xadmuseums,’\\u2009” she says. “I don’t even know if I consider myself an artist. I’m more of an experience designer.”Either way, more are coming. The Color Factory, which made its debut in San Francisco in 2017 and charges $38 to visit intensely hued spaces filled with disco balls and giant Lite Brites, will open a pop-up in New York on Aug. 20. A Museum of Pizza is set for October.Vora says these competitors are a validation of his market. He plans to establish permanent locations in 2019 in New York and Los Angeles, as well as an international venue in Asia. And he’s already looking toward his next project, which may or may not be \\xaddessert-themed. “We’re passionate about ice cream,” he says, “but it’s just one movie franchise in our future Disney.”'),\n",

       "  'Thousands of oil workers are living in dormitory-like compounds in the Permian Basin.The Aries Residence Suites in Goldsmith, Texas, is one of many “man camps” that have sprouted in the Permian Basin, which is drawing fresh investment as oil prices have climbed higher.There’s not much to look at except dirt, mesquite, and sagebrush around the 10 acres of flat, almost treeless land near Goldsmith, Texas, where Aries Residence Suites runs a housing complex used by itinerant oil workers. Three years ago, all 188 rooms were as empty as the landscape—a testament to crude’s tumble from more than $100 a barrel to $30. Today, prices are up around $70 and almost every Aries bed is occupied, just as at many other “man camps” throughout West Texas.The Permian Basin, a more than 75,000-square-mile expanse of sedimentary rock that’s one of the world’s biggest oil plays, is drawing billions of dollars in new investment. Companies are scrambling to find people to do everything from operating drilling rigs to driving trucks. Wages have reached such lofty levels that even unskilled laborers can earn $100,000 a year. Many of the jobs are in remote areas with no houses, schools, or supermarkets, so free room and board are essential perks for workers, most of whom elect to leave their families at home.David Penny, a 57-year-old pump operator who’s originally from Zimbabwe, stays at the Goldsmith camp during his two-week shifts. “It’s a great place to work, but a terrible place to live,” he says, citing the heat, dust, and dearth of grocery stores and restaurants among the negatives. His wife, who lives 370 miles away in Dallas, “would never come out here, and I don’t blame her one bit,” says Penny over lunch at the on-site cafeteria.Thousands of workers now reside in dormitory-like compounds in West Texas and eastern New Mexico, and more are on the way. Aries, which has 11 locations spread out over North Dakota, Oklahoma, and Texas, is expanding Goldsmith, which is near capacity, to 400 beds and will soon break ground on a 500-bed facility in Orla, Texas, a town with new oilfield activity but a population of less than 300.Permian Lodging, which operates one of the biggest man camps in the basin, says all 1,200 units at a 90-acre lot outside Midland, Texas, are occupied, and it recently built a slightly smaller facility roughly 100 miles southwest, near Pecos. The company is also readying two other camps in Texas and one in New Mexico, for a total of almost 1,300 beds.“It’s crazy,” says Dennis Noland, founder of Alpha Resources, a human resources consultant that does work with companies in the Permian. “It is the best example of a boomtown, Wild West area that I’ve ever seen.”The Permian’s production is set to double by 2023, aided by investments from Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp., BP Plc, and others, to reach 5.4 million barrels a day, according to estimates by researcher IHS Markit Ltd. That would top the output of any country in OPEC except Saudi Arabia. By 2035, it could hit 6.3 million barrels, projects Wood Mackenzie, another researcher.While the industry desperately needs more workers, few are willing to relocate full time to the sparsely populated rural areas in which the drilling takes place. Many jobs are an hour’s drive or more from the nearest supermarket, restaurant, or bar. Temperatures can linger above 100F for days, and the absence of trees means no natural shade for workers pulling 14-hour shifts.Conditions like that are why Robert Wardrup, 54, calls the Permian “the armpit of Texas.” Wardrup is shacking up at the Aries camp in Goldsmith while working as a cement supervisor for Baker Hughes’s BJ Services unit. He arrived about a year ago after being laid off from an oil industry job in Alaska’s Prudhoe Bay, where investment has declined.Many companies pay for their employees to stay in temporary housing, and some even pick up travel expenses. Such perks make the hardship worthwhile, especially with the premium pay. “It’s a very good living,” says Wardrup, who makes $27.50 an hour. “If you don’t have a college education, where else are you going to make $100,000 a year?”There are few alternatives to the man camps, because the housing stock in the Permian was paltry to begin with, and the oil boom has pushed rents across the region to their highest level since at least 2005. A 700-square-foot apartment in Midland—the Permian’s unofficial capital—goes for $1,300 a month, a third more than last year.For the oil and gas industry, the man camps are the lowest-cost alternative, especially since most employees work weekslong shifts broken up by short trips home. A double room at a man camp can be as low as $36 a night, while motels and hotels in Midland and Odessa can run as high as $500.The digs aren’t fancy. Most rooms aren’t bigger than a standard walk-in closet, and workers often bunk with someone they’ve never met. At camps where meal plans aren’t included, kitchens are shared among 10 or more workers.It costs Permian Lodging at least $15 million to set up a 400-bed camp, but it can be done quickly. At the company’s Midland County camp, some of the 80-by-18-foot trailers still have the wheels from when they were hauled down from the Bakken oil fields in North Dakota.The expenses of maintaining a small community in the middle of the desert can add up, says Ralph McIngvale, a partner at Permian Lodging who lives at the Midland County camp for about three weeks a month. At the facility near Pecos, for example, the company had to truck in 24,000 gallons of water a day for a month after the local water treatment plant was damaged by lightning. Retaining staff for housecleaning and maintenance is also difficult, because many get poached to work better-paying oil jobs.Operators of the camps have been adding amenities like 24-hour cafeterias, entertainment rooms, fitness centers, and on-site Wi-Fi. “We’re trying to make everything nicer and nicer,” says McIngvale. “The No. 1 thing I’m trying to do for my customers is help them retain their worker.”Despite the creature comforts, the camps are no place like home, says Jaime Portillo, whose family lives 300 miles away in El Paso, Texas. “It’s very lonely,” he says while grilling ribs for a small group of fellow truck drivers at the Midland County camp. “But you don’t have to pay rent or stuff like that. I just want to give a better life for my kids.” Portillo earns $20 an hour, plus overtime, hauling sand used by oil drillers in hydraulic fracturing. A few weeks ago, he took his 16-year-old son and 10-year-old daughter to Walt Disney World in Florida, and hopes to save enough to send his kids to college.“It kind of sucks sometimes, because all there is out here is just work,” says Nathan Rabe, 20, who lives at Target Lodging’s Anadarko Wolf Camp in Mentone, Texas. Rabe, who works on a rotation that’s three weeks on and one week off, earns $21 an hour as a test-and-torque operator for WS Energy Services Inc. The money is so good he’s debating whether to return to Texas A&M University in the fall, where he would be a junior.Man camps aren’t new in Texas, where rigs have been pumping crude for more than a century. Troy Schrenk, chief commercial officer of Target Lodging, which owns or operates eight facilities in the Permian for a total of more than 3,800 beds, says the camps used to have “a very negative reputation” as places that were rugged and rowdy. As the number of compounds ticks up, developers have been reaching out to surrounding communities to reassure them that things have changed.Today, most of the facilities don’t allow alcohol, and the expanded amenities help tenants cope with boredom during the hours when they’re not at work. “We don’t like to make them feel like they’re in prison,” says Regina Lucas, who manages the Aries Goldsmith camp and lives there part time. Companies also say they are working to make sure women feel safe and comfortable in the camps, though there are few of them.Midland County has recorded some minor “disturbances” at the camps, but Sheriff Gary Painter says the tenants generally have been good neighbors. “They get to drinking and fire a couple rounds in the air,” Painter says. “But it’s not serious.”Communities that have seen their share of oil booms and busts view the man camps as a necessary part of supporting the current economic expansion for as long as it lasts. “It’s not that man camps are bad,” says Ken Winkles Jr., executive director of the Pecos Economic Development Corp. “It’s just that we would prefer to have the families in here.”'),\n",

The Walt Disney Co.-produced installments topped the box office in each of the last three years and helped set a record in 2016, when space-themed films accounted for 14 percent of the top 100 films at the domestic box office.*2018 data as of July. Data: IMDb, Box Office MojoThat’s compared to 4 percent on average since 1950 and an all-time low of zero percent in 1966, according to an analysis of box office data from Amazon.com Inc.-owned IMDb and its subsidiary, Box Office Mojo, about the top 100 grossing films with keywords “space,” “outer space,” “space travel,” or “space ship.” Note: Includes only movies in top 100. Data: IMDb, Box Office MojoThirteen of these films were the biggest box office hits the year they were released, including eight Star Wars films and cult and fan favorites 2001: A Space Odyssey, E.T., and Avatar. The second-biggest space franchise after Star Wars is Star Trek—each of its 13 films, released between 1979 and 2016, have earned an inflation-adjusted average of $200 million.A closer look at the data reveals that a new, and recurring, movie lexicon emerged from the 1950s to the ’60s , with words and phrases like “alien invasion,” “astronaut,” “crash landing,” “monster,” and “robot” popping up a lot in descriptions of characters and plotlines. The mid-1970s through the ’80s was about delivering ambitious storytelling—“good versus evil,” “space opera,” and “supernatural power.” The new millennium ushered in a violent spate of space films, characterized by keywords such as “ambush,” “battlefield,” and “fictional war.” '),\n",

From top to bottom: the primary lift balloon, a secondary balloon for altitude control, a solar panel, and the payload.World View has figured out how to keep a capsule stable 100,000 feet above the Earth. Interested in a ride?The chicken sandwich has to get to space.This is what everyone at World View Enterprises Inc. was thinking as they set to work in the predawn hours of June 29, 2017, at the Page Municipal Airport in Arizona. KFC Corp. had hired World View, a maker of high-altitude balloons, to ferry a Zinger, which consists of a spicy breaded chicken fillet topped with lettuce and a little mayonnaise on a sesame seed bun, through the upper reaches of the atmosphere and into the heavens. The publicity stunt would result in glorious images of the sandwich set against the stark black backdrop of space, and it would announce World View and its balloons to the paying public. “At first we thought it might not be a good idea,” says Andrew Antonio, director for business development at World View. “People would think we’re the chicken sandwich company, and that would be really bad. But we were just starting out, and ultimately this seemed like the perfect opportunity to use millions of dollars in KFC’s ad budget to tell our story.”The Zinger launch preparations were intense. In the months leading up to the flight, nondisclosure agreements were put in place and signed. Rob Lowe was hired as a spokesman. A team of engineers built a solar-powered, animatronic KFC bucket that could tweet, take selfies, and house the sandwich beneath a protective glass dome. Zingers were tested in thermal vacuum chambers to see how they would react to pressure and temperature extremes. Then, just ahead of the launch, a group of food artists took over a local KFC and cooked dozens of Zingers, coating them with strange substances to make them beautiful. The Zingers were lined up and judged like pageant participants, and one was finally anointed the hero sandwich, the one with the fowl charisma and fast-food fortitude to brave the rigors of space in the name of over-the-top marketing.On launch day, the World View team attached the Zinger payload to the end of a long strip of polyethylene laid out on the tarmac. Against a desert backdrop of thirsty grasslands and burnt-orange plateaus, the plastic slowly filled with helium and started to take the shape of a massive teardrop. Lowe, doing his voice-over work, went through a countdown sequence. “Stand by to give status report when called. Launch systems? Aerodynamic descent systems? Balloon systems? Digestive systems? Roger, we are a go for launch for the Zinger 1 bucket satellite.” And up the Zinger went, to 67,143 feet, streaming video as it rose. Did it make it all the way to space? Not quite. Did it stay up for only 17 of the planned 96 hours? Yes. But who cares? KFC got its ad campaign, and World View got a heck of a lot more than that.Founded in 2012, World View had only ever flown its balloons, called Stratollites, for a few hours in one go. The chicken sandwich mission represented its maiden voyage toward something more significant—a time when its balloons could sail the winds of the stratosphere for thousands of miles and then hover over a point on Earth for days or even months. The KFC test helped fund research and development around the Stratollite’s avionics systems, solar panels, and communications. In the year that’s followed, World View’s researchers have come up with techniques to build durable balloons and software and sensors that exploit previously unknown nuances of the stratosphere. The company has also raised $42 million from venture capitalists hoping it will alter the way we take images of Earth, predict the weather, and, one day, get tourists into space.“Balloons have been around for decades but have never really been used in a way where there is navigational control,” says Jane Poynter, World View’s co-founder and chief executive officer. “Our rather genius engineers have figured the winds in the stratosphere out.”The history of high-altitude balloons goes back to the late 18th century, when the French, in particular, demonstrated a gift for releasing huge volumes of hot air into casings of rubberized silk that would float up into the skies. One of the first flights took place in 1783, with a sheep, a duck, and a rooster hovering for 8 minutes at 1,500 feet over Versailles. Not long after that, humans decided to attach themselves to the things, giving the public and militaries around the globe a new frontier to explore—and a new way to look at their home.Things really started to get interesting in the middle of the 20th century, as a series of adventurous, brilliant, foolish people decided to see exactly how high balloons could go and what a human body hanging beneath them could take. The U.S. and Russia took to endurance ballooning with the same competitive fervor they would later display with rocketry. Without some protection, people tend to lose consciousness from oxygen deprivation at 50,000 feet, and bodily fluids boil at 63,000 feet, but these factors were apparently only mild deterrents. Individuals were initially crammed into tiny, crude gondolas with often untested safety systems. Many of the results were as expected, with people passing out during their journeys, freezing, and generally being tortured for hours or days—that is, when they didn’t die.One of the great heroes of this era was Joe Kittinger, a pilot in the U.S. Air Force. He was the kind of guy willing to have a rectal thermometer inside him for 48 hours, or chew his way out of a safety harness—yes, these things happened—if that’s what it took to get his ballooning job done. In 1957 he was packed into a gondola beneath a balloon for a mission dubbed Manhigh. Despite a major mishap with his oxygen supply system, Kittinger set a record by rising to 96,000 feet. In 1960 he topped himself by going to 102,800 feet and then jumping out of his gondola. He dropped for four and a half minutes before engaging his parachute, reaching 614 miles per hour at one point, and repeated the same words over and over as he neared the ground: “Thank you, God. Thank you.”As the space race heated up, interest in ballooning waned. Great advances had been made in gondolas, safety systems, and balloon materials, and much of this technology would aid astronauts. The public, however, was no longer as moved by ballooning feats, and the militaries of the U.S., Europe, Russia, and Japan invested their time and money elsewhere. Tourists still dabbled with hot air balloons, and high-altitude balloons continued to be used as scientific instruments, but Kittinger’s altitude record held until the turn of this decade, when two risk takers decided to put their lives on the line.Red Bull GmbH, naturally, was involved in the first attempt to best Kittinger, because nothing says “energy drinks are cool” like sending someone plummeting to his possible death at high speed. It sponsored the daredevil Felix Baumgartner in his 2012 jump from a helium-filled balloon at 128,000 feet.In 2014, Alan Eustace, a computer scientist who was then a senior vice president at Google, tried to top Baumgartner. Eustace saw the feat as an engineering challenge. “It made no sense to build a giant capsule or gondola,” he says. “They had caused more problems than they had solved.” (People had died after hitting their gondolas during jump attempts.) He chose to dangle from the end of a balloon wearing a pressurized suit before being dropped from 135,908 feet, basically the edge of space. Many of the key people who made the life-sustaining suit and other technology possible would go on to become the core team at World View.From Mojave, Calif., to Midland, Texas, it’s fashionable these days for scrubby Southwestern locales to have spaceports. Not the kind of city to be left out, Tucson erected Spaceport Tucson in late 2016, part of a $15 million incentive package meant to keep World View in town. The 142,000-square-foot office and manufacturing facility and accompanying 700-foot launch pad abut Tucson’s international airport, ringed by mountains, cactus, and miles of ruddy desert.Compared with flying humans and sandwiches, World View’s most immediate, commercial mission is somewhat prosaic. It offers customers the ability to fly cargo weighing from 100 pounds to 20,000 pounds as high as 19 miles into the stratosphere, where it can hang out—or “station keep,” in balloon lingo—for days, weeks, or months. Some of the earliest customers have been governments and companies looking to take precise pictures of a specific location. Satellites and drones can do this type of work, but World View has time, precision, and cost advantages. “Over time, we operate for less than a 10th the cost of a drone,” says Taber MacCallum, co-founder and chief technology officer of World View. “We’re solar-powered and mostly autonomous and just sit there at this high altitude looking down.”Because World View can affix all manner of objects to the end of a balloon, it can do more than take spy photos. Scientists can send up complex measurement systems. Militaries and aid organizations can position communications systems to provide internet and phone services in remote locations. And weather forecasters can place instruments directly into interesting spots. “We are jonesing to get one of these things into a hurricane and see if we can stabilize in the eye,” MacCallum says. The company’s long-term goal is to have dozens of balloons flying in shifts all around the world, reporting back and building the most detailed view ever of the world’s weather.Until recently, the prevailing wisdom among balloon aficionados was that these types of missions weren’t possible. People believed the stratosphere had billowing, jet stream-like winds that flowed in one direction and would shove a high-altitude balloon around too much for it to stay in one place long enough to do anything useful. But, through much trial and error, companies such as World View and Loon LLC have discovered new facets to the stratosphere. Crucially, World View found that at the right heights, there are crisscrossing winds. This makes it possible for a balloon to remain relatively stationary by, in effect, flying in a figure-eightish pattern, bobbing up and down. “The circle you rotate around is five miles in diameter,” Poynter says. “You go up a bit and down a bit, and find these winds that take you around and around.”On a November morning at about 3 a.m., World View’s engineers and technicians begin showing up for a launch at Spaceport Tucson. They’re months past the Zinger extravaganza and are setting out to put up a military imaging system and fly it from Arizona to Mexico, where it will hang out for a few hours before coming back for a landing. It’s the desert, so the air is cold and crisp as they begin setting up fueling tanks, communications gear, and calibration equipment beneath three floodlight towers aimed at the pad.The first step of a launch involves carting a folded balloon out to the pad and unfurling it. A car drives very slowly for 30 minutes, spreading the long stream of polyethylene across the ground. At the base is a white case called a stratocraft, which looks like a pyramid with its top cut off; it holds the payload. Next up the line are some solar panels, and then a yellow tube that carries helium to the balloon. A couple of men connect large, cylindrical guns to the base of the balloon and begin pumping in the gas. As the tip of the balloon fills, the big plastic snake stands up like a 400-foot-tall cobra.MacCallum paces around the launch pad. Like a rocket launch, a balloon launch comes with a mix of tedium and tension—so many things must be checked and rechecked. The procedure manual for this mission runs 118 pages. There’s the wind to worry about and, of course, the safety of the people on the ground.The actual event, though, is nothing like the percussive, soul-tingling blast of a rocket catching fire and roaring against the chains of gravity. It takes 90 minutes to fill the balloon, at which point there’s a mild jolt as the full tension of the thing travels up to the top and back again. Then the helium hoses are detached and the balloon jumps into the air like an excited jellyfish. Once it picks up speed, it floats up at 1,000 feet per minute and will take 75 minutes to get to a working altitude.“It’s pretty graceful and always seems miraculous to me,” MacCallum says. Engineers use telescopes to watch the balloon’s ascent and check for any problems or, God forbid, leaks. None of this is subtle. Anyone near the airport can see the giant plastic mass making its way up. “I will get at least three UFO spotting calls today,” Antonio says.In mission control, seven people track the balloon’s path and help steer it via software. The amount of helium stays fixed, but ballast controllers adjust the balloon’s overall mass via the intake and expulsion of air. It’s this technology—the exact details of which remain secret—that makes World View unmatched in controlling altitude changes. On this mission, the balloon does as planned. It catches some strong winds and sails to Mexico and back. When World View is ready for it to come down, some onboard machinery springs into action. The cord connecting the payload to the balloon is chopped and a steerable parachute unfolds. Then mission control sends signals to levers to guide the payload, which travels at speeds as fast as 250 knots, to a location of World View’s choosing. The balloon can’t be steered, but it usually lands within a few miles of a predicted area.Things don’t always run smoothly. For safety reasons, World View picks remote spots for the return to Earth, and its team doesn’t always reach the goods first. During an early mission, a payload was taken hostage on its return by someone in the desert. The man claimed it had killed his dog and hurt his grandmother, and he asked for money to give it back. (World View’s video showed the payload had landed safely.) On another occasion, a scavenger was seen on camera debating whether to hold the payload for ransom or strip it for parts. This caused World View to add a “call for reward” sign to its hardware for a spell, though the landings have recently become much more precise and the sign is no longer needed.More distressingly, a balloon exploded on the launch site in December, creating a massive boom and fireball. World View mostly uses helium, but on this day it was running a test with hydrogen, which is cheaper and easier to get. Engineers were testing a venting mechanism when static electricity built up and sparked the gas. “The employees were a bit frightened,” Poynter says. “We’re not supposed to blow things up.” No one was hurt in the incident, but Tucson officials were unimpressed, noting extensive damage to walls, doors, and windows at the company’s headquarters. Meanwhile, the explosion reinvigorated critics of the sweetheart deal World View got on the property and building.The explosion has done little to slow the company’s operations. Since the Zinger, it’s conducted more than 50 flights, primarily for the U.S. government, and kept its balloons up in the air for many days at a time. The company is in the process of preparing launches that will take balloons to the equator, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and across oceans. “People want us to do things like sit over the Red Sea and Indian Ocean and look for pirates,” MacCallum says. The company plans to start flying for commercial clients early next year. “Basically, our mission is to take over the stratosphere,” he says.Experts contend that winds—or, really, the lack of them—at some latitudes will limit what sorts of routes World View can fly and when it can conduct missions. Poynter dismisses such criticisms, saying it will be possible to get consistent coverage everywhere the company wants by using teams of balloons. “The doubters make me happy,” she says.In a back corner of World View’s immaculate factory, there’s a red-and-white canister big enough to hold eight people. It’s cylindrical, with rounded bulges on both sides and at both ends, each with nine windows arranged in a circular pattern. Even though Poynter and MacCallum spend most of their time talking up commercial applications for their balloons, their real dream—their life calling—is to take this capsule into space and let people see Earth with fresh eyes.Poynter, 56, and MacCallum, 54, are wife and husband. She’s a Brit; he’s a Yank. Growing up, they were both free-spirited adventurers fascinated by the question of how people could live in space. They met in the 1980s while doing research missions at sea, and both ended up living inside the Biosphere 2 enclosed habitat from 1991 to 1993. “I went in because it seemed like such a forward-thinking idea to re-create planet Earth’s biosphere in miniature and then use that to sustain life elsewhere,” Poynter says. “I thought it was the closest I would ever get to doing something like actually being on Mars.”Biosphere 2 was plagued by personal and technical issues, but the romance between Poynter and MacCallum survived. Before they had even left the bubble, they’d decided to start a company called Paragon Space Development Corp. It would become well-known for engineering all manner of oddities meant to hold up under extreme conditions. NASA had Paragon make a breeding system for animals on the space station; the U.S. Navy asked for a specialized suit that would let divers go into sewage or chemical-laden water; Elon Musk asked the company to develop plans for a greenhouse on Mars.As they worked on these projects, MacCallum kept thinking back to his childhood. He grew up in New Mexico and spent time around big balloons as a kid. His father worked as a scientist at Sandia National Laboratories and was part of a team that discovered a black hole at the center of the Milky Way by attaching gamma ray-hunting telescopes to balloons. “I would go out and see these huge things with their massive payloads, and it stuck with me,” MacCallum says. “I have always been a space head.” One day he walked into Poynter’s office at Paragon and brought up the idea of doing some big balloons of their own. “I’m like, ‘Absolutely. That’s exactly what we’re doing,’\\u200a” Poynter says.The driving idea is to make space truly accessible. “We wanted to give people that seminal experience that astronauts talk about where you see the curvature of the Earth, the blackness of space, and have the mental space to really experience the planet,” she says. Instead of being strapped into a rocket, however, World View’s passengers will float into space slowly and peacefully inside a pretty roomy cabin without the need for a spacesuit or any special training. There will be a bar and a bathroom. People will reach 100,000 feet and hang out for two hours before being piloted down with the steerable parachute. Philippe Bourguignon, former head of Euro Disney and Club Med SAS, is an investor in World View and will be one of the first people to head to space when—if?—the $75,000-a-person flights begin in the next few years. “I bought tickets for my whole family,” he says. “But the company needs to hurry up, because my family is growing and there are more grandkids coming.”As for exactly what the ride will be like, we could turn to a chicken sandwich for an answer or, better yet, to Eustace. “It will be a beautiful experience,” he says. “It will be the most peaceful ride you could imagine in this totally quiet environment instead of with a rocket shooting off and vibrating behind you. This will appeal to a huge number of people that want to see things from a different perspective. That’s all I can really say. You know something is good when it’s almost impossible to describe.” '),\n",
       " ('Hollywood Braces for Collateral Damage From Trade War With China',\n",
       "  '2018-07-19',\n",
       "  'ILLUSTRATION: VIKTOR HACHMANG FOR BLOOMBERG BUSINESSWEEKThis was supposed to be a big year for Hollywood in China. The five-year World Trade Organization film pact the U.S. and Beijing signed in 2012 was set to be renegotiated, holding out the promise that American studio productions would gain greater access to the world’s second-largest movie market. The industry had expected to see an increase in the number of U.S. films allowed, more access to key viewing windows such as summer, when China’s film authorities rarely allow foreign movies, and a higher share of box-office receipts.Now it’s looking like Hollywood’s long-awaited payday in China could become collateral damage in the trade war brought on by President Trump’s tariffs. Not only have negotiations about widening access to the market stalled, but some in Hollywood also quietly worry that their films could be targeted in retaliation for tariffs the U.S. has identified for about $250 billion in imports from China. “The timing for this is inopportune,” says Chris Fenton, a trustee of the U.S.-Asia Institute and former president for U.S.-China film company DMG Entertainment. “In fact, the macro environment may be getting worse. It also could lead to the worst-case possibility of China backtracking on past agreements.”Although it’s uncertain whether movies will end up on the lists of goods the U.S. or China have said might get slapped with new tariffs, the threat to American film exports is clear. Hollywood could be a victim should China choose “qualitative retaliation,” says Kenneth Jarrett, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai. That could include a worsening of revenue-sharing terms for film deals. Or China’s film industry regulatory authority, recently shifted to a group within the Communist Party, could simply approve fewer U.S. films for import or limit their runs to low-season periods.In a January report on China’s WTO compliance, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative said Beijing had agreed to discuss “policies and practices that may impede the U.S. film industry’s access to China’s market.” This month, however, China said it is “forced to retaliate” for the Trump tariffs but didn’t set targets. The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative declined to comment on the current status of the film talks. “We are hopeful both governments can continue to work together,” Chris Ortman, a spokesman for the Motion Picture Association of America Inc., said in an email.Movies could be especially vulnerable to China trade actions because they’re one of the very few U.S. imports that dramatically exceed exports. U.S. companies “are worried about regulatory retaliation, whether approvals will be hung up, or you could see a slowdown in the imports of Hollywood movies,” Jarrett says.Viewers per film screening in ChinaData: Bloomberg calculations based on Maoyan Movie data*Through the first half of the yearU.S.-made films’ share of China’s $8 billion market is on track to decline for a third year, an analysis of data from Box Office Mojo shows. U.S. studios in recent years have been losing ground to local films such as Wolf Warrior 2, a nationalistic action flick that last year became China’s best-performing movie. And American releases increasingly are bested by Bollywood imports such as Secret Superstar, a big hit on the mainland made for a fraction of the budget of a typical Star Wars or Avengers movie. “Hollywood blockbusters have seen better days in China,” says Chen Qin, who researches China’s film market at Fudan University’s School of Economics. “Even if China increases Hollywood’s access to the market, those films are still not going to sell well.”That’s in part because of the fast audience growth in China’s smaller cities, where patrons have less exposure to Western culture and are more likely to choose films with Chinese themes, Chen says. Many viewers across China are also unfamiliar with the characters and plots of older American film franchises, so they don’t get much out of watching the latest installment—one reason Star Wars movies have fared relatively poorly there.Winning viewers in China is crucial for the six biggest Hollywood studios, which have come to rely more on superhero and franchise action films. China’s box-office revenue grew about 20 percent in 2017, compared with a 2 percent decline in the U.S. and Canada, according to data from the MPAA. The U.S. and Canadian industry was able to eke out a 2 percent gain in revenue from 2013 to 2017, but only by raising ticket prices.China’s state-owned film distributors typically pay American studios just 25 percent of the revenue their films generate in China. That’s half the rate studios get in the U.S. The distributors also control release dates and marketing. Still, Chinese audiences sometimes help Hollywood studios make up for their movies’ poor domestic performances. Uprising, the latest installment in Legendary Entertainment’s Pacific Rim film franchise, collected about $100 million in China and just $59 million at home, according to Box Office Mojo. A new Tomb Raider movie in March took in almost $79 million from China and only $57 million in the U.S.Even with market share shrinking, U.S. studios’ total revenue from China is likely to rise because the audiences are growing so fast. And a stronger Chinese movie industry could even be good for Hollywood if it makes the authorities less concerned about keeping out overseas competition, analysts say.At the same time, the boom in theater construction in smaller cities has helped boost box-office results for local nationalistic fare over Hollywood blockbusters. For example, on the heels of Wolf Warrior 2’s success in 2017, another Chinese military action movie, Operation Red Sea, is leading box-office sales this year.Hollywood films accounted for almost 38 percent of total China revenue in the first half of this year, analysis of Box Office Mojo data on the 50 biggest films in the period shows. That’s down from 48 percent in 2016. The waning pull of U.S. blockbusters is seen even more clearly in audience numbers per screening. Based on calculations using Maoyan Movie data on the top 10 films in the first half, Hollywood movies averaged 16 seats sold per screening, compared with 28 for Chinese productions. (The Chinese government tracks box-office sales but doesn’t report on the national origin of films.)In China, unlike in the U.S., Indian movies are becoming potent rivals. Bollywood’s Secret Superstar raked in 747 million yuan ($111 million) earlier this year, beating U.S. blockbusters Black Panther and Star Wars: The Last Jedi. Last year the Indian film Dangal grossed about $193 million in China, more than the Walt Disney Co. hits Coco and Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales.With trade tensions flaring and Hollywood’s hold on China’s filmgoers fading, U.S. studios may have to calibrate their demands for an end to the annual quota. “Hollywood needs to be careful,” industry executive Fenton says. “More films in the China market may dilute the performances respectively of each, causing more films to lose money than to profit. As a result, U.S. studios may be better off lobbying for an increase in the percentage of ticket sales from the 25 percent they get currently as the overall top request.” —With Jing Yang De Morel, Anousha Sakoui and Danni Wu'),\n",

       "  '2018-07-03',\n",
       "  'As a trade war looms, one of Chinese President Xi Jinping’s biggest weapons could be boycotts of American brands by his country’s legion of consumers.But Xi would also be risking collateral damage at home: The China operations of all-American brands ranging from Coca-Cola Co. and McDonald’s Corp. to Walt Disney Co. are co-owned by state-backed Chinese firms.One of Coke’s main China partners is government-backed COFCO Corp.; Shanghai Disneyland is part owned by a local consortium, and McDonald’s franchisee in the country is controlled by state-backed conglomerate Citic Ltd. and private-equity firm Citic Capital Holdings.The Shanghai Disneyland theme park.“The perfect Stars-and-Stripes corporate victim doesn’t exist,” said Tom Orlik, chief economist in Beijing with Bloomberg Economics. “The number of big clean wins in terms of striking against the other guy -- without accidentally punching your own guy in the face -- is extremely small.”Even when Chinese companies don’t have direct ownership links with U.S. brands, Orlik said, boycotts or other non-tariff retaliation would hit the local partners of those American companies.Early shots in the trade war are set to be fired on Friday, with the U.S. scheduled to impose tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese exports. Beijing has said it will place levies on an equal value of U.S. goods, a move that Trump said would lead to additional penalties. This week, the U.S. moved to block China Mobile Ltd. from entering its telecommunications market, citing national security risks.“By now there is no backing out,” Pauline Loong, managing director at research firm Asia-Analytica in Hong Kong, said on Bloomberg Television on Monday.The disposable income of Chinese city dwellers rose nearly 40% over 5 yearsSource: National Bureau of Statistics of ChinaUnlike overt actions like tariffs, boycotts by Chinese consumers appear suddenly and usually follow angry rhetoric by government-controlled publications and social media. In earlier conflicts with foreign countries, Chinese citizens inflamed by nationalistic news coverage, boycotted high-profile international brands like Toyota Motor Corp. and Hyundai Motor Co., hurting corporate profits and boosting Chinese leverage.A Toyota car dealership destroyed during an anti-Japan protest, in Nov. 2012.Imports of Chinese goods into the U.S. totaled $505 billion in 2017 while China only imported $130 billion from the U.S., limiting Xi’s ability to respond with tit-for-tat penalties. However, American companies sold $280 billion of goods and services in China last year through their local subsidiaries, according to Deutsche Bank AG. That creates a big target.“No U.S. product sold in China, or U.S. company invested in China, can be considered safe from its retaliation,” said Yanmei Xie, a China policy analyst for Gavekal Dragonomics in Beijing.Besides boycotts, Beijing could consider creating costly administrative bottlenecks for U.S. imports or impose punitive measures against U.S. companies operating in China, analysts at research firm TS Lombard wrote in a June 20 note.So far government-controlled media have said little on how consumers should respond to a trade war with the U.S., although an editorial in the Global Times highlighted anti-U.S. sentiment in Europe as well as calls by Canadians to boycott American goods because of Trump’s penalties on imported steel and aluminum. Xi’s government last month said China would retaliate immediately and forcefully to U.S. tariffs.Can Trump Win a China Trade War? We May Soon Find Out: QuickTakeProminent consumer brands like McDonald’s and KFC have in the past been easy targets, with thousands of restaurants across the country.But since anti-U.S. demonstrations in 2016 targeted them with calls for boycotts, the U.S. owners of both fast-food giants have sold their controlling interests in their Chinese operations.Oak Brook, Illinois-based McDonald’s owns only 20 percent of its Chinese namesake, having sold the rest last July to state-backed conglomerate Citic Ltd. and other investors.Louisville, Kentucky-based Yum! Brands Inc. no longer owns the KFC and Pizza Hut businesses in China, having spun off Yum China Holdings Inc. in 2016. Meanwhile, in April 2017, Coca-Cola sold its China bottling assets to COFCO and Hong Kong-listed Swire Pacific Ltd.Consumers trying to punish Trump by staying away from Disney’s $5.5 billion theme park in Shanghai would end up hurting Chinese companies because the American firm is just a minority shareholder there. A state-run consortium, Shanghai Shendi Group, owns 57 percent of the resort, which opened in 2016 and attracted more than 11 million visitors in its first year.So consumers looking to punish an American brand could unknowingly punish a Chinese one as well.That may be a price Xi’s willing to pay, especially since he’s not the only one facing the risk of collateral damage. Trump’s efforts to punish China will damage U.S. business, with its farmers losing if China finds other suppliers of commodities like soybeans. And not all American brands have Chinese partners, so Beijing could simply decide to single out some.A Chinese court, ruling in a patent dispute case, issued a preliminary injunction banning U.S. semiconductor maker Micron Technology Inc. from selling 26 products in China, according to a Tuesday statement from Taiwanese rival United Microelectronics Corp. Micron said it hasn’t been served with the injunction and won’t comment until it does.If political ties deteriorate sharply, many Chinese looking to do their part probably won’t be too concerned about who owns what, according to Bruno Lannes, a Shanghai-based partner with consultancy Bain & Co.“I’m not sure Chinese consumers have a real understanding of the ownership structure of companies that do business in China,” he said. “If they’re told this is a U.S. company or a U.S. product, then they would accept that even if the majority share is owned by a Chinese company.”— With assistance by Enda Curran, and Debby Wu'),\n",

       "  '2018-06-13',\n",
       "  'Publishing house Panini must contend with a surge in sales when the tourney rolls around every four years.A creative team at Panini discusses new products.SOURCE: PANINIFabrizio Melegari admits he’s one of the few people in Italy looking forward to the World Cup. Sure, along with the rest of the country, he was heartbroken when the Azzurri—the national soccer team—lost its chance to participate in this summer’s tournament after a 0-0 tie with Sweden on Nov. 13. “The fan inside each of us got hit hard,” says Melegari, editorial director at Panini SpA, the maker of baseball-card-like World Cup stickers collected by the soccer-besotted worldwide. “But from a commercial standpoint, it’s not hitting our business at all.”The company’s sales surge every time the World Cup rolls around as kids (and often the former kids known as parents) buy hundreds of stickers to paste into albums. The 80-page booklet is free, but the stickers cost about $1 for a packet of five. Schoolyards in Europe and Latin America become de facto trading floors for Panini stickers where kids swap duplicates for players they need to complete their album. Anyone lucky enough to get no duplicates (read: nobody) would spend almost $150 to get the 681 stickers, but most will pay more than $300 even after swapping with friends. “It’s an expensive business,” says Luca Masse, 50, a surveyor who says he’s managed to put together a full set for the past half-dozen World Cups. “If you buy a few packets at a time, you’ll never finish the album.”Panini is part of a universe of companies that feed off the global competition every four years. Shoe and athletic-wear makers such as Adidas, Puma, and Nike all ring up substantial sales of special shoes and team jerseys created for the tournament. Watchmaker Hublot SA, the event’s official timekeeper, introduces soccer-themed models including this year’s Big Bang Referee (ostensibly for use by the officials calling the matches) offering digital links to scores and other game data. And McDonald’s Corp. has promotions tied to the competition, including special cards for Panini albums. “From a sponsor’s perspective, to be associated with the most popular game in the world is very attractive,” says Tim Bridge, a director of the sports business group at consulting firm Deloitte LLP.Few are as reliant on the tournament as Panini. Although the company doesn’t release financial details beyond annual revenue, that figure has climbed by more than a third in each of the past four World Cup years and typically drops in the year following the quadrennial competition. Sales for 2014, for instance, jumped 38 percent, to €758 million ($917 million), then fell to €522 million in 2015. In a World Cup year, the company’s global workforce of 1,100 expands by about 20 percent. At Panini’s headquarters in Modena—a city of 180,000 on the plains south of Milan best known as the home of balsamic vinegar—production staff doubles, to about 240 workers. For six months prior to the competition, they feverishly cut the stickers from newspaper-size sheets and slot them into machines that mix them randomly and seal them inside the packets. By the time the first ball is kicked, more than 90 percent of the stickers will have been sold. “You have to be incredibly flexible and fast,” says Melegari. “If you don’t have stickers, kids will come back once or twice, OK, but by the third time you’ve lost them.”To reduce its dependency on the World Cup, Panini has diversified far beyond soccer. In 1961 the company started producing albums and cards—at the time you had to supply your own glue for pasting them into place—with a booklet on the Italian pro league; it produced its first World Cup album for the 1970 tournament in Mexico. In recent years it’s added more entertainment series, making albums and stickers tied to dozens of titles featuring, for example, Disney characters, Harry Potter, and Spider-Man—a legacy of the company’s ownership by Marvel Entertainment LLC in the 1990s.As for Italy’s failure to make it into the competition, collectors say this year’s album will be extra-valuable without Panini’s home squad—the first time since 1958 that the team hasn’t qualified. For Melegari, it’s just business. “In the past we’ve had to publish the World Cup album without France, without England,” he says. “In those countries it meant a lot, but on an overall basis, there’s always one big team missing.”'),\n",

       "  'The ruling for the Time Warner acquisition ends any hope that Trump’s arrival in Washington would usher in a wave of populist antitrust crackdowns.On June 12, U.S. District Judge Richard Leon approved AT&T Inc.’s $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc., rejecting the federal government’s ham-handed effort to block the deal. Leon ruled that the government had failed to make its case that the combination of AT&T, the country’s biggest pay-TV distributor, with Time Warner, the owner of CNN, HBO, TNT, TBS, and Warner Bros., would hurt competition and lead to higher prices. The judge approved the deal with no conditions.It was an ignominious outcome not just for Makan Delrahim, Trump’s antitrust chief at the U.S. Department of Justice, but for anyone still clinging to the faint hope that Trump’s arrival in Washington might usher in an era of populist antitrust crackdowns. Far from dealing a decisive blow to the monopolistic creep of corporate America, the government’s failure against AT&T will probably have the opposite effect. Consolidation will accelerate. Big media will grow bigger.Not long ago, Trump was promising to reverse the trend. During the 2016 presidential campaign, he would occasionally train his populist spray gun on AT&T’s pending purchase. There was already too much power concentrated in the hands of too few, he told crowds. This led to the type of insider corruption he said he was fighting against.It was almost possible during such moments to imagine Trump, if elected, reinvigorating America’s once barrel-chested monopoly-busting tradition. Perhaps he would travel to Washington with a well-whiskered, wild-eyed Steve Bannon, visions of bearlike Theodore Roosevelt dancing in their heads, and savagely maul mergers with the relish with which Trump once disemboweled boardroom supplicants on The Apprentice. First, AT&T would come to heel. Then so would the rest of the greedy globalists.Nope.The DOJ filed its suit to block the deal in November 2017. AT&T’s lead attorney, Daniel Petrocelli, quickly struck back, calling attention to a televised interview that Delrahim had given months earlier when he was still working in the private sector. During the interview with BNN Bloomberg, Delrahim said that because AT&T, a content distributor, was proposing to buy Time Warner, a content supplier, the deal was a “vertical merger”—as opposed to a “horizontal merger,” in which two direct competitors team up. The last time the feds had tried to block or dissolve a vertical merger was in 1977, when the DOJ took on Hammermill Paper Co. and lost. Delrahim said that while the sheer size of the deal would attract scrutiny, “I don’t see this as a major antitrust problem.”So what changed? In speeches last fall, Delrahim said that the department was taking a new approach toward mergers. Trump’s DOJ would rely less on “behavioral remedies,” which require or restrict specific actions on the part of the combined companies for a set period of time following the merger. Such remedies, Delrahim argued, were often ineffective and created a pseudo-regulatory process that the courts were ill-equipped to enforce. Instead, he said he favored “structural remedies,” in which the merging companies would be required to divest problematic divisions or product lines to gain approval. Before filing suit, Delrahim’s team discussed two potential structural remedies with AT&T: selling DirecTV, its satellite TV provider, or forgoing the acquisition of Turner Broadcasting, Time Warner’s division of pay-TV networks that includes CNN, TBS, and TNT. AT&T had declined to do either.As the suit moved toward trial, Petrocelli and other AT&T advocates went on to suggest that the government’s true motivation was Trump’s personal grudge against CNN, a major asset within the Turner Broadcasting portfolio. Throughout the campaign and since becoming president, Trump had called the channel “fake news,” “fraud news,” “garbage journalism,” “dishonest,” “unwatchable,” “distorted,” “sick,” “a great danger to our country,” and “the enemy of the American people.” The name-calling, of course, is just one tactic in his media disparagement routine, and CNN’s not the only target. He’s blacklisted news organizations from campaign events. He’s threatened to yank broadcasters’ licenses. He’s fantasized about changing libel laws to make it easier to sue reporters. He’s mused about revoking White House press credentials. He’s mocked the physical disabilities of one reporter, claimed that a TV news anchor was suffering from botched plastic surgery, and invoked the menstrual cycle of another.But could the president actually manipulate federal antitrust enforcement as part of a strategy for controlling the press? It’s been done before. In 1963, according to an account in Robert Caro’s The Path to Power, President Lyndon Johnson sized up a pending bank merger in Houston and saw a political opportunity. The president of one of the banks was also the head of the Houston Chronicle, one of the most influential papers in Johnson’s home state. Johnson reached out to the publisher-banker and offered to disarm the government’s opposition to the bank deal if he would guarantee in writing that the Chronicle would henceforth shower Johnson in favorable coverage. The publisher-banker acquiesced.President Richard Nixon carried on the tradition. In 1971, Attorney General John Mitchell was preparing to file an antitrust suit against the three largest TV networks (ABC, CBS, and NBC) over their monopoly ownership of prime-time TV shows. Nixon, however, decided to hang fire. “If the threat of screwing them is going to help us more with their programming than doing it, then keep the threat,” Nixon was recorded telling an aide in the White House. “We don’t give a goddamn about the economic gain. Our game here is solely political.”Was Trump playing a similar game with AT&T? The White House and DOJ have repeatedly shot down the suggestion. But Trump did seem to be dangling the company on a string. In the early days of the administration, AT&T Chief Executive Officer Randall Stephenson cozied up to Trump. He described himself as one of Trump’s “biggest defenders on public policy,” met with the president-elect at Trump Tower, and praised him to investors. Behind the scenes, AT&T began paying $50,000 a month to an obscure limited liability company founded by Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen. AT&T said it hired Cohen’s firm for insight on Trump administration views on issues such as antitrust enforcement and corporate taxation.Throughout the courtroom proceedings, the government struggled to tell a convincing story about the risks the merger posed for consumers. Several witnesses testified that the combination of AT&T and Time Warner would create an unstoppable behemoth. This merged monster could favor its programming over shows from other entertainment companies. Or it could restrict other cable, satellite, or web TV distributors from gaining access to its top networks—thereby jeopardizing the innovation of streaming TV services, such as Netflix Inc. or Hulu Inc., that are delivered to consumers via the web. It was all very bad, the government argued, and ultimately would cost consumers more than $400 million a year.But weeks of testimony turned up little in the way of damaging revelations about AT&T’s plans. Again and again, representatives of AT&T and Time Warner coolly downplayed the government’s concerns, testifying that withholding Turner programming would be self-defeating because its profitability depends on wide distribution. From the start, AT&T said it would be happy to allow arbiters to resolve any disputes that might arise during fee negotiations with rival distributors. The acquisition, they argued, would give AT&T better insight into how its customers prefer to interact with TV shows and advertising—ultimately allowing AT&T to design cheaper, more efficient, more satisfying experiences for its millions of customers.Meanwhile, Petrocelli effectively attacked the credibility of the government’s gloomy projections. He argued that even if the government’s flawed analysis were correct, the merger would result in a price increase of only 13¢ per subscriber per month—which he called “statistically indistinguishable from zero.” And by the time he was done, the government’s case looked statistically indistinguishable from roadkill.A year and a half into his presidency, Trump’s promises to curb the dangerous influence of big media companies haven’t progressed much beyond the DOJ’s actions against AT&T and Time Warner. If anything, the government has tilted in the opposite direction. Since his arrival in D.C., the Federal Communications Commission has proved as committed to populist media reform as the farm-to-table dining community is dedicated to Choco Tacos.Under Ajit Pai, the former Verizon Communications Inc. lawyer Trump appointed to head the FCC, the commission has been busy steadily loosening the nation’s rules restricting media ownership. The changes have only encouraged more consolidation, such as Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc.’s pending $3.9 billion acquisition of Tribune Media Co.—the completion of which, critics argue, will further crimp local TV news reporting around the country.Media watchdog groups—which have long been concerned that the self-interest of powerful corporate interests would someday stifle independent and investigative journalism—have watched in alarm as the FCC has rolled back the so-called net neutrality rules. The changes, critics say, have given big conglomerates more power than ever to determine what information and programming reaches consumers.At the same time, the long-simmering concerns about media consolidation have been joined by new anxieties about the consolidation of power in the far larger, far richer tech giants (Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft) and the vexing societal problems—online abuse, data theft, privacy violations, election interference, and conspiracy mongering, to name a few—radiating from their most successful media products.Part of AT&T’s rationale for acquiring Time Warner is that to compete successfully with the tech megalodons, the company must get bigger. Virtually every media and telecom conglomerate these days is making the same justification: Silicon Valley is coming for our dinner, and if we don’t get larger, we’ll be left fighting over the scraps.That may be true. But the argument that to survive amid monopoly-size behemoths you have to first achieve their monopoly-size stature will hardly placate the growing chorus of economists who believe that Silicon Valley giants have already grown too powerful and might need to be broken up. How the loss to AT&T will affect the DOJ’s appetite for fighting monopolistic trends in the tech world remains unclear.To date, Trump’s stance on technology consolidation looks a lot like his position on media consolidation: wildly inconsistent and personal. Throughout the campaign, he often singled out Amazon—whose chairman and CEO, Jeff Bezos, is the owner of the Washington Post—as a company in need of stronger antitrust scrutiny. At one point, during an appearance on Fox News, Trump told Sean Hannity that Amazon has a “huge antitrust problem.” More recently, he’s taken to attacking Amazon on Twitter, suggesting that the U.S. Postal Service should be charging Amazon more for deliveries. The antitrust division’s assessment of Amazon shouldn’t depend on the nature of the Washington Post’s coverage of Trump. Yet even after this administration’s loss to AT&T, it still might.Meanwhile, any kind of sustained antitrust pressure looks less and less likely under the current administration. Far from wilting under the Washington spotlights, AT&T and Time Warner executives seemed energized. They repeatedly used their time in court to promote AT&T’s bigger-is-better vision for the future of wireless communications and home entertainment. Rather than stifling web TV services, they argued that the merger would spur innovation.At one point, CEO Stephenson went so far as to unveil a streaming TV product from the witness stand. He explained that the online bundle of TV channels, called AT&T Watch, wouldn’t include any sports, and as a result would cost only $15 a month. AT&T wireless subscribers who have an unlimited data plan, he testified, would get it for free. What started as an example-setting populist attack by the Trump administration turned out to be a high-profile, government-sponsored marketing event for AT&T. —With Scott Moritz and Erik Larson Bidder: CVS Health\\nTarget: Aetna\\nAnnounced: October 2017\\n$68 billion\\n \\nBidder: Cigna\\nTarget: Express Scripts\\nAnnounced: March 2018\\n$54 billion\\n \\nBidder: Walt Disney\\nTarget: 21st Century Fox assets.

       "  'Beam Drop Inhotim by Chris Burden.In the hours after the twin towers fell in Lower Manhattan, Bernardo Paz had a flash of inspiration. He called up his curator, Ricardo Sardenberg, who was helping him create a private museum in the hills of southeastern Brazil. Paz had become rich by taking over bankrupt mining companies, and he sensed an historic opportunity to build a world-class art collection. “If there’s a time to go to New York, it’s right now,” Sardenberg remembers Paz saying even as they watched the televised loop of the towers collapsing. As soon as flights to New York resumed, they went.The galleries in Chelsea were quiet, but dealers were relieved to entertain a buyer, and Paz scooped up sculptures and installations by top contemporary artists “for the price of a banana,” in Sardenberg’s words. He favored pieces too unwieldy for most private collections, such as The Forty Part Motet by Janet Cardiff and George Bures Miller, in which 40 loudspeakers play 40 individually recorded voices singing an English Renaissance choral composition. No matter that Paz didn’t have a place to display it. He’d have a structure built, large enough for someone to stroll by each speaker and make out a single voice with one ear while hearing the whole chorus with the other, as the artists had intended.Before that September trip, few in the art world had heard of Paz. But in just a few years, his backyard collection would grow into one of the world’s largest open-air museums. Known as Inhotim (pronounced “een-yo-CHEEN”), it’s now a major stop on the international art circuit, despite being located in a depressed mining region 16 hours by plane and car from New York or London. It doubles as a tropical garden and nature preserve, and amid the 700 acres of flora imported from as far away as Madagascar and Sri Lanka, you’ll find special commissions such as Matthew Barney’s De Lama Lâmina, in which a tractor clutches a ghostly white tree beneath a geodesic bubble. Two installations incorporate pools that visitors can swim in. There are also standalone galleries dedicated to individual artists, including one for the works of Adriana Varejão, Paz’s fifth wife (of six).Paz has said he poured as much as $70 million into Inhotim some years. The result, according to Wallpaper magazine, “is a unique dialogue between art, architecture, and nature”—or, as ArtReview would have it, “the Jurassic Park of contemporary art.” To Brazilians, it’s a national treasure that has transformed the country’s cultural life and drawn millions of tourists.But Inhotim is also a monument to the ubiquity of dirty money in the art market. In the final months of 2017, Paz was convicted of tax evasion and money laundering; his museum was found to have gained from the scheme. And these weren’t the only misdeeds that helped to fund his great project. Over a long history of wrongdoing that has never been fully reported, Paz broke a series of environmental laws and even benefited from child labor to build his fortune.At 67, Paz has long, flowing white hair and a white beard yellowed by cigarettes. His eyes are blue and intense. He declined to comment for this article, but under normal circumstances he loves to talk. In the space of a single 2013 interview, he claimed to be the first foreign businessman to meet Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping (“When I went to China, only the Jews were there”), said he can’t get turned on by a woman over 50 (“I’m a man of few pleasures in life, and one of them is sex”), and spoke proudly of the quilombolas—descendants of escaped slaves—he hires to work in Inhotim’s gardens (one of whom was cured of his wish to “kill white people”).Paz believes beauty changes lives, and, perhaps because he lets the poor in for free, he’s called Inhotim “a factory of citizens” and “the greatest social project anyone in the world has ever done.” He’s also called himself a socialist, and scoffs at the ostentation of other rich people with their yachts and private jets. Preparing to head to Davos for the World Economic Forum in 2010, he said, “When I get there, I’m going to look those soft-asses in the face and tell them all to go to hell.” (He actually gave a speech about the unifying power of contemporary art and received a standing ovation.)Paz is a strange sort of cosmopolitan. He’s happiest at home in Minas Gerais—literally “general mines,” the state where he grew up—and speaks English only haltingly. At an event in California in 2014, he said, “My mother was a poetry, and was a painting, and was a sociologist. And my father was a engineer, and his father was a general, who did all the frontier in Brazil.” Then he switched to Portuguese to recall that his dad sang patriotic hymns to him every night, and that this made him feel like he had to be a hero one day.Today Paz is rich, though it’s hard to gauge just how rich. He’s said Inhotim is worth $1.5 billion, but the pieces commissioned for the museum have never had their values established by a sale. He owns 29 companies, but none are publicly traded and most have ceased operations. Even the active ones lack websites or public-relations offices. Perhaps the best clue to his fortune emerged in 2010, when he announced the sale of his iron-ore business to the East China Mineral Exploration & Development Bureau for $1.2 billion. According to a person involved in the deal, the buyers backed out after digging into the books and finding massive tax debts.Paz’s early career also left little trace in the public record. The way he’s described it in interviews, he got into mining by accident. In 1973 his first wife’s father, a banker in Minas Gerais, took him on at a failing iron-ore company called Itaminas. Paz, then 23, had little training for this. He’d dropped out of high school and worked in a clothing boutique before a stint as a stockbroker. Dreamy in his new role as overseer, he liked to observe the colossal trucks carting deep-red earth to the ore crusher and imagine all that would be built with the resulting steel. But he was dedicated, working till midnight and waking before sunrise to watch his workers arrive. Sometimes he slept in a tent at the mine. Soon, he was made the company’s director.Itaminas was swimming in debt. In a foolhardy bid to pay it off, Paz started taking over other insolvent mining companies. “It was the worst suffocation of my life,” he later said. He occasionally drank a whole bottle of whiskey to get to sleep. His father-in-law died in 1980, and eventually his wife got fed up and left him, though he kept Itaminas in the divorce. The day they separated, he went to a bar and met his second wife, a 22-year-old Austrian, with whom he had his third child (of seven). But nothing changed. He was drunk when he bought his first pig-iron plant to smelt the raw ore from his mines.In those days, Paz cared more about profit than great social projects. To heat his smelting furnaces, he needed fuel. So through a company called Replasa Reflorestadora SA, he started cultivating 50,000 acres of eucalyptus, a fast-growing tree that can be harvested for charcoal. The government leased him land in northern Minas Gerais to that end, even though 60 families already used the area for subsistence farming. Known as geraizeiros, they’d been there for generations, grazing cattle and growing manioc and corn.José Gonçalves Dias, 41, remembers accompanying his father in the 1980s to gather squash and watching as Replasa’s men called the police to haul him away. “It was a humiliation,” Dias says. “Replasa cracked down on every little thing.” The family couldn’t even gather firewood.The area had once been thriving tropical savanna. But eucalyptus is a notoriously thirsty tree, and the geraizeiros noticed that Replasa planted at the headwaters of streams—areas protected under Brazilian law. Dias’s community now lives along a dusty road in homes of unpainted cinder block with small enclosures for chickens. Showing me around, he sweeps his arm at a dried-out basin. “We used to bathe and fish here,” he says. After the stream dried up, water had to be purchased for $160 a tank—a fortune for them.Many left to seek work in faraway cities. Dias stayed and did what he could to help put food on the table. He says he was 10 years old when he went to work in a carvoaria—an array of crude ovens that turn wood into charcoal. His job was to slather wet mud on the ovens to keep them sealed as they burned. Wearing flip-flops as he clambered on top, he sometimes burned his feet. He did this job for four years, always off the books, for a Replasa subcontractor. His sister, Maria do Rosário Gonçalves Dias, now 44, says she started working directly for Replasa at age 14, dispersing ant killer without a mask or boots. Both say many other kids worked alongside them. Another geraizeiro, Pedro Ferreira de Santana, 43, says he did the same work as Maria when he was 16, an age when minors in Brazil are allowed to work but not to handle pesticides. He was paid half the minimum wage. (A lawyer for Replasa says the company never used child labor and that safety equipment was mandatory.)The press never got wind of any of this. Instead, Paz’s first major scandal arose from a more visible disaster. In May 1986, seven workers died after a dam broke at one of his mines. Regulators said Itaminas had overloaded the dam with tailings, and a worker told the press it had been thrown together without a proper engineering plan. Just the same, less than two weeks later, Paz was awarded a medal of “industrial merit” from two Minas Gerais business groups, which celebrated him for expanding Itaminas into a conglomerate with 4,000 employees and annual revenue of half a billion dollars. He traveled constantly to China, becoming one of the first Brazilian mining executives to sell his product abroad. When others succumbed to the economic crises of the ’80s and ’90s, he survived.It helped that Paz often failed to pay his taxes, forcing the government to negotiate installment plans. He claimed he simply didn’t have the money, but he was pouring cash into his garden the whole time.Paz has said that children understand contemporary art better than their parents do—which is partly why he likes it. This is obvious at Inhotim. On a Wednesday, when entrance is free, I wander the stone paths that meander through the park, passing trees too large to wrap one’s arms around, and benches carved from giant trunks, and man-made lakes, and manicured expanses of lawn, all tended by a small army of gardeners. At one end of the park, I stop at a piece by Yayoi Kusama: 500 stainless-steel spheres floating in a water garden. Visitors are taking selfies in the sun. At the other end, guests navigate the steel forest of Chris Burden’s Beam Drop Inhotim, which the artist created by releasing 71 girders from a crane into a pit of wet cement. People walk for miles, but I see few symptoms of museum fatigue. Atop a hill, a group of boys play with a kind of giant kaleidoscope—Olafur Eliasson’s Viewing Machine, which can be trained on the surrounding rainforest. From that point, it’s also possible to make out, beyond Inhotim’s perfect square of green, the red earth of hills torn up by iron-ore mining.Inhotim began as an unintended consequence of Paz’s 1980s takeover spree. One of the companies he bought came with land in the municipality of Brumadinho, which was then known only for its leprosarium. Legend has it that the property once belonged to an Englishman locals called ’inho Tim—“Mr. Tim,” in the rural vernacular. Paz decided to make his country home there, and, in the tradition of empire builders since Nebuchadnezzar II, he began designing a garden.He got advice from the best: Roberto Burle Marx, the renowned Brazilian landscape architect, who awakened in him some latent aesthetic yen. Paz started buying Brazilian modernist art, but collecting remained a hobby until 1995. On a business trip that year he suffered a stroke and was forced to stay in bed for a week—the first real respite of his adult life. He decided to step back from his business empire, move into Mr. Tim’s old house, and throw himself into the garden.His taste in art grew more adventurous. One day he acquired a sculpture that didn’t fit in his house. It was an assortment of iron bells hanging from three surreally tall canes—Deleite, by Tunga, one of Brazil’s greatest contemporary artists. Tunga, who became a friend, pushed Paz to let the public visit his garden.Inhotim wouldn’t open its gates until 2006, but the project became all-consuming. Paz wanted to create something more than a world-class collection—something unique, transformational. He hired the best curators he could find. One was Allan Schwartzman, now chairman of the fine art division at Sotheby’s, who started working on Inhotim in 2003. “You’re in the middle of nowhere,” he remembers telling Paz. “Why would anyone travel 15-plus hours to get here?” But Schwartzman had a solution: “Let’s commission artists to do some of their most ambitious dream projects—projects they’ve been thinking about for years but never thought they’d be able to create.” For one of the first commissions, the American artist Doug Aitken, who’d previously worked mostly with video, designed Sonic Pavilion, a five-year project that involved digging a 663-foot well and installing microphones at the bottom to transmit the sound of the Earth to a listening station on a hill.The strategy was ingenious: Artists charged little, or even nothing, for the opportunity to work on such a grand scale. Still, the installation costs could be extravagant, and site-specific works weren’t exactly fungible investments. Even among top collectors, Paz’s boldness was unusual. “I don’t know anyone who’s collected on the scale he’s collected without an eye toward what this means in terms of long-term value,” Schwartzman says. Paz also stood out for putting every free penny into collecting. One dealer remembers him walking up to her stand at a fair, identifying three pieces he liked, and buying them without a second thought. As soon as Paz moved on, an Inhotim curator stayed behind to cancel the sales, explaining that he was trailing Paz to “unbuy” impulsive purchases.Iron-ore prices were soaring in those days, thanks to demand from China. But Inhotim had barely opened to the public when rumors surfaced that it was a front for laundering ill-gotten funds. Partly this was because Paz’s brother Cristiano had recently been accused (and was later convicted) of funneling government kickbacks to corrupt officials through his public-relations firm. Partly, as former Inhotim curator Jochen Volz laments, “people just couldn’t believe that somebody would be so insane as to build a museum in Brumadinho.”The bad press lent urgency to a plan to make Inhotim a nonprofit, insulated from the ups and downs of its founder’s life. Paz liked to say he was planning the museum for the next 1,000 years. He often spoke of building an airport, four hotels, and a convention center, to establish what he called a “post-contemporary Disney World” that could fund itself in perpetuity. He also dreamed of building self-sustaining villas where people would live and work remotely, creating “a model of life in perfect tune with nature, but also very connected to technology.” He wasn’t afraid to use the word “utopia.”But not long after Inhotim opened, a series of government investigations began uncovering the environmental and labor violations that had helped Paz build his fortune—and then the financial crimes that had shielded his fortune from taxation. The first sanction came in 2007, after labor inspectors descended on a charcoal operation that supplied one of Paz’s pig-iron companies, Itasider–Usina Siderúrgica Itaminas SA, and found 36 people working in “slavelike” conditions. According to the inspectors, the workers had been forced to buy their own chain saws, with payments automatically deducted from their salaries, and made to live on a site infested with scorpions as they cut wood for the ovens. For buying charcoal made under these conditions, Itasider was placed on a government blacklist, cut off from state financing for three years. Vale SA, Brazil’s largest iron-ore producer, also suspended sales to the company. (At the time, Itasider said it had stopped buying charcoal from this supplier. Lawyers for Paz declined to comment.)Then, starting in 2008, Brazil’s environmental protection agency began cracking down on the trade in charcoal from the Amazon region. As far back as the 1980s there had been reports that one of Paz’s companies, Cosipar, used fuel made from illegally deforested trees; Itasider and another of Paz’s pig-iron companies were slapped with $13 million in fines for this and related infractions. Later inspections would show they kept using black-market charcoal anyway.In 2009, state inspectors made the first significant survey of Paz’s eucalyptus plantations. They discovered the environmental violation that local farmers had observed decades earlier: Replasa had planted at the headwaters of streams. They also found the company had failed to set aside 20 percent of its land for preservation, as the law requires.The farmers, meanwhile, had grown tired of feeling corralled, unable to use the land. So in December of that year, Dias and his fellow geraizeiros occupied part of Paz’s tree farm. Seventy police officers were called in to remove them. In the legal battle that ensued, an activist lawyer named André Alves de Souza discovered that Paz had leased the lands from the government and never left them, even though the attorney general for Minas Gerais had determined that the leases were illegally extended by an official implicated in a scheme to sell off public lands. Alves filed a suit questioning Paz’s claim to the area, and a judge granted an injunction halting Replasa’s operations. (The case is pending.) Replasa was subsequently denied a key environmental license, and its plantations were mostly shut down. Further denting Paz’s fortune, he had to pledge a pig-iron complex as collateral for his various fines and injunctions; Itasider was eventually producing so little that it dropped out of a local industry group.Despite Paz’s growing fame as a patron of the arts, none of this reached the public consciousness. What finally drew press attention was the allegation, in 2009, that he’d received tens of millions of dollars from a mysterious fund in the Cayman Islands.Unlike his brother, Paz was never linked to political corruption. Instead, prosecutors would accuse him of laundering undeclared funds from his mining conglomerate. It was no secret to Brazil’s internal revenue service that he’d neglected what one tax-levy case calculated to be at least $200 million in taxes and social security contributions over the years. But as they pored over the books of Paz’s 29 companies, Minas Gerais state prosecutors also uncovered accounting methods they claimed veered into criminal tax evasion. A separate, federal inquiry found evidence that he’d spirited vast sums offshore, then quietly brought the funds back home to spend on his pet project.The investigators focused on a holding company called Horizontes that Paz had formed to administer Inhotim. In 2007 and 2008, Horizontes had received $98.5 million from a Cayman Islands entity, the Flamingo Investment Fund. Investigators found that, to get around a tax on cross-border investments, the payments had been registered as loans from anonymous parties. But the loans were never repaid, nor any interest charged. Allegedly, Paz used some of the money going through Horizontes to buy land for Inhotim and transferred some to his other companies, ordering employees to cash checks for as much as 500,000 reais ($131,500) at a time. Although investigators failed to track the money from there, they suspected Paz had used it to buy art—which always remained his personal property, on loan to the nonprofit that ran the museum.Responding to the charges, Paz insisted the Flamingo fund belonged to someone else. But he couldn’t say who. At a 2015 deposition he searched for a name, theatrically shutting his eyes and raising his palm to his face. “He’s the owner of—oh, God,” he said. “It’s the sixth-largest bank in Switzerland. UFC, UFC\\u2009…” (It wasn’t UBS.) Nervously stroking his white mane, occasionally thumping the table in front of him, he framed his tangled web of money transfers as simple accounting mix-ups. “Being a businessman in this country is complicated stuff,” he said. He listed all the economic crises he’d weathered and claimed he’d neglected his taxes only to avoid laying off workers. He even resorted to mentioning his stroke and the six wives who’d left him because of his obsession with work.Federal Judge Camila Velano kept interrupting to return to the substance of the accusations. Exasperated, Paz addressed her as filha—in essence, “girl”—before correcting himself. Asked about his huge withdrawals of cash, he said, “Some time ago, I started taking a lot of tranquilizers and my memory went to hell, so I now have some difficulty remembering the past.”This didn’t help his case. In September 2017, Velano handed Paz a nine-year sentence for money laundering. (She also convicted his sister, Virgínia, of involvement in the scheme.) Then, three months later, another judge convicted Paz of evading $10 million in taxes, sentencing him to an additional five years in prison.Justice is slow in Brazil, so Paz (and his sister) could remain free for years while appeals are pending. His life, though, has changed irrevocably. With his cash flow dwindling, museum staff had been signing up corporate sponsors, which began threatening to cut off their donations. Paz saw little choice but to step down as Inhotim’s chairman. He used to tour the grounds every morning in a golf cart. Now he barely leaves his art-filled mansion in a section of the park closed to visitors.Still, Paz has kept the esteem of many curators and gallery owners who’ve dealt with him. Luisa Strina, a São Paulo dealer who sold him four pieces by legendary Brazilian artist Cildo Meireles, says of his tax evasion, “It’s not my problem.” Thiago Gomide, another dealer who’s known Paz for years, says the authorities should actually “thank God” he didn’t pay his taxes, because the park might not exist otherwise. “Better for them to have a museum,” Gomide says, “than to have 10 times the money, which will be poorly spent.” The reactions aren’t much different outside Paz’s circle. One dealer in New York expresses dismay only at the prospect that Inhotim could shut down—then asks for inside details on what will happen to all the art.Paz wants to leave a legacy at Inhotim. “It’s my function in life,” he told Judge Velano in 2015. “I’m a guy who fights for ideals.” He may yet fulfill his goal. In April he struck a deal to pay off $100 million in back taxes by transferring ownership of 20 artworks to the government, including Barney’s De Lama Lâmina, Aitken’s Sonic Pavilion, and four pieces by his ex-wife Varejão. Citing Inhotim’s importance to the local economy, officials promised to keep the art at the museum. The deal was, in essence, an imprimatur for the most brilliant trick of Paz’s career—deciding personally how his taxes should be spent for what he saw as the common good. Yet, even inside his circle, some feel uneasy about what he will leave behind.Paz started buying the work of Brazilian artist Miguel Rio Branco in the ’90s. The conversations they had helped inspire Inhotim’s creation, and today the museum has a whole building to display Rio Branco’s color-saturated photographs of humble Brazilians. Now 71, Rio Branco lives and makes his art in a sprawling compound in Araras, in the high mountains north of Rio de Janeiro. Sitting on a couch in his studio, surrounded by hanging canvases and dusty tools, he’s initially quick to forgive his patron: “He has that degree of craziness that every artist has, which sometimes allows you to do extraordinary things. But he’s not an administrator, obviously.” Anyway, he says, “Brazil has so many taxes that if you paid all the taxes in your life, you wouldn’t be able to do anything else.”His expression changes when he hears what Paz did in the north of Minas Gerais. Rio Branco wasn’t aware of Paz’s pig-iron business or his vast fields of eucalyptus. At first he insists Paz must not have known about the methods that built his wealth—or that if he did, his “conscience” had since evolved. “Great fortunes are usually problematic,” Rio Branco says. “But at least they built something.”He stands up. A half-dozen dachshunds scamper after him as he opens the door to his garden and slips into a gap in a hedgerow, plunging into a labyrinth of manicured bushes and tall, flat stones. He tried to sell the labyrinth to Inhotim, he says, but the curators balked at the price. For now its value remains theoretical, the sum of construction costs and a future patron’s premium.Rio Branco keeps coming back to how Paz made his fortune. Eucalyptus, he says, is “totally destructive.” And those charcoal ovens: “prehistoric.” Finally he admits that Paz’s mining business had already troubled him. Inhotim might be a perfect square of paradise, but extractive industries have laid waste to the surrounding forests, leveling whole mountains in search of ore. “Inhotim for me would be a kind of restitution for that,” Rio Branco says. “But is it enough of a restitution? Maybe not.”Even that restitution, of course, is little solace to the people who bore the cost of Paz’s ambition. Up in northern Minas Gerais, Dias says he’d never even heard of Inhotim until his legal battles with Paz. Yet the people who visit the park, he says, are just as clueless about Paz’s misdeeds. The only hint can be found in a plaque denoting one of the park’s endangered plants. It’s a bush with purple flowers—the canela-de-ema, native to a stretch of savanna not far from Replasa’s fields. —With Alice Maciel '),\n",

       "  '2018-06-06',\n",
       "  'ILLUSTRATION: KHYLIN WOODROW FOR BLOOMBERG BUSINESSWEEKFor the past two decades, Spain’s state-run RTVE and private rivals Mediaset España and Atresmedia have been fighting for viewers’ hearts with slates of game shows, sports, comedies, and glossy morning news. Now, in a plot twist worthy of the steamiest soap opera, they’ve decided to hook up: This summer the adversaries are launching LovesTV, a shared 18-channel streaming platform with programming from all three networks. The goal is to “aggregate broadcasters and serve as a common entry point into the digital world,” says Arturo Larraínzar, strategy director at Atresmedia.A similar script is playing out across Europe, as long-standing foes in Britain, France, Germany, and Italy set aside rivalries to co-produce programs or offer shows online. The reason: interlopers from across the Atlantic. Netflix Inc. this year is doubling its European programming budget, to $1 billion; Amazon.com Inc. will soon have at least a dozen original series from Europe, up from one in 2014. And Home Box Office Inc. is boosting its non-U.S. offerings this year by 40 percent, to 250 hours of shows. These newcomers could spur a mass defection of viewers to the increasingly convenient web, and Europe’s traditional broadcasters are scrambling to find a response. “Consumers no longer care where they watch our content, so why should we still draw strict lines between linear and nonlinear, offline and online?” asks Bert Habets, chief executive officer of RTL Group, a traditional broadcaster that’s launched streaming sites in France, Germany, and four other countries.“It’s confusing to have a different app for every network”The model the Europeans say they’re emulating is Hulu LLC, the U.S. streaming service owned by perennial antagonists Comcast, Time Warner, 21st Century Fox, and Walt Disney. Since its launch in 2007, Hulu has grown to 20 million subscribers, who pay $8 to $40 a month for access to hundreds of shows. Just as the U.S. networks have gone online to hold on to America’s 120 million TV-watching households—and the ad dollars they represent—European companies say they can build a simple video platform to keep viewers from clicking away. “People want this overriding interface,” says Alan Wolk, co-founder of media analysis website TVRev. “It’s confusing to have a different app for every network.”Building a Hulu in Europe, with its dozens of languages and patchwork of regulations, will be trickier than in the U.S. Broadcast rights for most shows are sold country by country, so it’s difficult to put together a seamless service for the entire region. Different rules about storing recorded shows in the cloud—France, for instance, has more relaxed guidelines than the U.K.—could be a roadblock. And regulators in Germany and the U.K., citing antitrust concerns, have blocked broadcasters’ efforts to cooperate. “I don’t think it’s going to be simple to do a pan-European play,” says John Turner, a partner at media adviser OC&C Strategy Consultants.That hasn’t stopped the broadcasters from trying. In recent months, ProSiebenSat.1 Media SE in Germany has teamed up with Discovery Inc.—which owns the popular Eurosport franchise—to create a service called 7TV, and the two are seeking partners in other countries. Britain’s media regulator has encouraged a similar alliance between the BBC, ITV, and Channel 4. Spain’s LovesTV will offer livestreams of all three of its networks and allow viewers to see the past week’s shows to catch up on episodes they may have missed.The American upstarts are also spurring erstwhile rivals to sacrifice exclusivity and share costs. The BBC and Channel 4 have teamed up with Hulu and AMC Network Entertainment. And public broadcasters in France, Germany, and Italy have agreed to cooperate on what they call “bigger” shows; they say they’d welcome companies in other countries as well. “If we pool our resources, we can have a strong voice on the international scene,” says Delphine Ernotte, head of France Télévisions SA.Even with shared resources, they’re likely to lose some premier programming to the cash-rich Americans. Netflix spent about $7 million per episode of The Crown, roughly five times what ITV—the U.K.’s biggest commercial broadcaster—paid for Downton Abbey (though the company doesn’t release figures for its shows). With so much money available, “screenwriters and directors increasingly want to work with the multinationals,” says Karin von Abrams, an analyst at researcher EMarketer Inc. “The funding is better, and they can actually see their projects become reality.”The broadcasters will find themselves in competition with homegrown rivals such as the TVPlayer platform in the U.K.—part-owned by Hearst Communications Inc. and Walt Disney Co.—and French startup Molotov.TV. The two-year-old company has signed up 5 million users with its Netflix-like interface offering three dozen channels for free and premium bundles starting at €4 ($4.67) a month. Molotov founder Jean-David Blanc says he’s in talks with British, German, Italian, and Spanish companies to expand into those countries. “The content providers, the producers, they want to maximize their chances to find their audience,” he says. “So the world is changing, obviously.”'),\n",

       "  'Photographer: Annie Schlechter for Bloomberg Businessweek“Go ahead, try some,” urges the Mad Hatter, a jovial redhead in a tall feathered hat and tails. He gestures toward a small apothecary bottle labeled “Drink Me.” It takes little persuading for Oona, my 7-year-old daughter, to grab it and gingerly sip, being careful not to spill any on her blue dress and white pinafore. Moments earlier her little brother, Zane, devoured a frosted sugar cookie that turned his mouth Cookie Monster blue. Soon, both are eagerly sampling other delights the be-hatted actor, Fergus Adamson, sets out on a little table before them.Like everything else staged in the back eight seats of the Global 5000 Bombardier business jet—including games of dominoes and croquet—it’s part of an extravagant (and expensive) tea party produced at a turbulence-free 45,000 feet. Up in the front section of the plane, three adults sip Ruinart Blanc de Blanc Champagne while checking email, completely undisturbed by the action a few rows back. They can’t even hear the children’s squeals of delight when it comes time to eat the chocolate truffles they made themselves by hand.Welcome to the world’s first official Alice in Wonderland adventure in the sky.For many kids on terra firma, playing dress-up and having a performer isn’t outlandish at a themed birthday party, but at cruising altitude, entertainment options are usually limited to a screen and headphones. Not so with VistaJet Group Holding Ltd., the subscription-based global aviation company that launched its Adventures in the Sky program on June 1.For a starting price of $4,000—not including the minimum $12,000 hourly cost of chartering the jet—travelers on the company’s 70 silver-and-red planes can retain Sharky & George, an exclusive London-based children’s party creator with an almost cultlike following, to devise enough antics to keep their kids happily busy from New York to Dubai.Actors first meet the children out of costume, to avoid any sky-high freakouts. And the activities, which include eating sugary snacks and playing active games, are all vetted for safety on a narrow plane. (They’re also messproof; when experimenting with colorful stickers, the company tested 17 variants to find ones that wouldn’t ruin the jets’ $65,000 leather seats.) Parties are adapted for different ages and interests, but they all start with a handful of themes: a moviemaking option complete with green screen; a spy adventure promising international intrigue; and, of course, Alice in Wonderland.Matteo Atti, executive vice president for marketing and innovation at VistaJet, believes an audience exists for concepts like these. “Given that one in every four VistaJet flights has a child on board, we saw the opportunity to build something incredibly special for our younger passengers,” he says. Researching and creating the product was a yearlong process. But it’s worth the effort to keep parents and children happy, he says, and to attract new flying families. “If you can trust us with your family, you can trust us with anything,” he says.According to luxury-travel network Virtuoso, the number of jet charter trips grew 10 percent from 2014 to 2016. PrivateFly, a global charter-booking broker that works with 250 operators worldwide, said in its first-quarter 2018 report that 15 percent of its passengers were younger than 16, up 50 percent from a year ago. In a market that Atti estimates has an addressable population in the mid-five figures globally, catering to—and retaining—each client is crucial, even if that client is 5 years old.“I fly privately because it makes it possible to do something special with my son and his friends in a single day, like going to the Grand Canyon to hike caverns,” says Eric Crown, co-founder and former chief executive officer of Insight Enterprises Inc., a Fortune 500 company. “He’s been on everything from prop planes to Gulfstreams since the age of 2.”For most parents who frequent private jets, it isn’t lavishness that makes it worthwhile but practical concerns—legroom, flexible scheduling, reliable Wi-Fi, and not having to worry about your kids’ behavior in front of 150 strangers.“Private terminal access at smaller airports makes traveling with children much easier to manage,” says David McCown, U.S. president and CEO of Air Partner Plc, a charter service and fractional-jet-ownership program. “Parents and kids avoid the hassle of long airport lines and TSA screenings.”The typical requests for flights with kids rarely go beyond asking for a particular board game or brand of pizza, McCown says. But most private jet companies need to go all-out to meet client expectations every now and then. Air Partner, for example, recently decorated a plane with balloons, presents, and cake for the 10th birthday of a client’s granddaughter—and then proceeded to make multiple stops to pick up family members across the U.S. before flying to Europe.NetJets Inc. makes a standard practice of providing coloring books and teddy bears for young travelers—who make up 10 percent of its passengers. If asked, the company will go further; it’s created Disney-themed flights for families and once put together an in-flight laboratory for a client’s science-minded granddaughter who was turning 8. “We have quite a few requests but don’t need to explicitly offer this as a service,” says Tom Ville, marketing manager for NetJets.Formalizing Adventures in the Sky is certainly a marketing play for VistaJet, but it also allows the company to be nimbler in responding to extravagant asks. And yet its most crucial kid-relating tools are subtler: Since only 10 percent of its clients fly with nannies, VistaJet’s Cabin Hostesses have all taken coursework in family-based psychology and age-based care at Norland College, an institute for early-childhood education in Bath, England. They’re trained to calm nervous little flyers and even bottle-feed. For parents who want something more special than a coloring book and less expensive than a full-blown party, the company will create activity hampers and backpacks—stuffed with treasure maps and stop-motion Lego moviemaking kits—to get kids excited.VistaJet flyers tend to have the means to indulge in such treats or spring for an Adventures in the Sky party, which can carry a six-figure price tag. Private jet “members” have an average net worth from $670 million to $1.1 billion.Of course, the best judges of whether it’s all worth it are the kids themselves. After her VistaJet tea party on a three-hour flight from New Jersey’s Teterboro Airport, Oona was so enchanted, she wondered aloud to me if she’d dreamed it all up. “Alice went down a rabbit hole, but I went up high in the sky,” she says. “It was so cool.”'),\n",

       "  '2018-04-30',\n",
       "  'ILLUSTRATION: JOHANNA WALDERDORFF FOR BLOOMBERG BUSINESSWEEKIn December, Sheila Schuler and her husband, David, were ecstatic to rent an apartment at the Domain, a cluster of well-kept pastel apartments in Kissimmee, Fla. The gated community’s palm trees and crystalline, cabana-lined pool felt like an oasis next to the nearby chaos of Walt Disney World, where Sheila works. Three months after signing a yearlong lease, the Schulers discovered Airbnb Inc. had co-opted their slice of paradise and that they would have to share their refuge with a potentially huge rotating cast of new faces. This summer the Domain will become the online booking giant’s first branded apartment complex, renting to tourists for short stays much the same way a hotel does. “We’ve been blindsided,” says David, who found out about the change from the building’s unofficial Facebook page. “We didn’t agree to live in a hotel.”It’s easy to see why vacationers headed for Kissimmee, which welcomes about 10 million visitors a year, would book the Domain. Along with Disney, the building is moments away from Universal Studios and Jimmy Buffett’s developing Margaritaville resort project, making it ideal for Airbnb’s grand hybrid experiment. But when that influx of tourists is happening next door, \\xadpeople tend to balk. The Schulers are among a dozen residents frustrated with the 324-unit complex, some of whom spoke to Bloomberg on condition of anonymity for fear building management would retaliate.Those who live at the Domain full time will be encouraged to sublet their spaces online when they’re gone for extended periods, and Airbnb’s guests will have access to amenities commonly found in hotels, including maid service, luggage storage, and digital keypads. Miami-based Newgard Development Group is overseeing the project through its Niido Powered by Airbnb brand. They, alongside the condo’s managers, are pressuring residents into an “Airbnb time-share operation,” says Domain renter Amanda Crane, who also works in the tourism industry. “I did not agree to this setup when I signed a lease.”Airbnb declined to comment. The Domain complex is designed to be a primary residence, says Cindy Diffenderfer, co-founder and chief marketing officer for Niido Powered by Airbnb. “We’re not trying to be sneaky,” she says. “We’re embracing a travel trend that we’re seeing in our properties.”The backlash from tenants doesn’t bode well for Airbnb; at least two of Domain’s residents say they’ve consulted with lawyers about their options. In December, Niido said it plans to open as many as six Airbnb-branded complexes in Florida like the one in Kissimmee. Airbnb, now valued at $31 billion, has an eye on expansion, announcing plans in October to team up with more real estate developers and facility managers. That should appease landlords, who have argued that Airbnb helps renters illegally sublet their apartments. But if the Florida project is any indication, Airbnb will face more complaints that it’s ruining the neighborhood feel by letting hordes of tourists run rampant on renters’ home turf.Expanding to branded apartment buildings is critical for Airbnb to win over luxury-craving customers, which would help justify its valuation, says Ivan Feinseth, chief investment officer and director of research for Tigress Financial Partners LLC, an investment banking firm. “Partnering with large landlords is the best way to get more consistency and control to offer a hotel-like experience but at a lower price,” Feinseth says. To broaden its appeal, Airbnb is adding listings for hotels as well as fancier digs under the label Airbnb Plus. Those sites get regular visits from an inspector to confirm that the towels are fresh and the appliances are working.Airbnb’s branded buildings promise management companies 5 percent to 15 percent of the profit hosts generate. At Domain, residents who rent through Airbnb would pay Niido 25 percent of their home-sharing income. In exchange, Diffenderfer says, residents will have access to the same hotel-style amenities visitors will receive.Niido didn’t tell residents about the Airbnb arrangement until April 19, after a Bloomberg reporter began asking questions about the venture. Some Domain residents say they suspected Airbnb was setting up a home-sharing operation after the complex manager, Dan Maggard, informed them their apartment locks would be changed to a digital system—but not why. He declined to comment. “I’m outraged. I’m beyond upset,” says Wilma Colon, who moved into the Domain complex about eight months ago. “My son uses the business center to study—now they’re making it into a lounge space for transient people who have no investment in our community.”Diffenderfer confirmed the Domain’s common spaces are undergoing renovations, which include the creation of a room designed for cooking classes and wine tastings sponsored by local restaurants. The business center will morph into a more collaborative space with co-working tables, she says.Improving the building’s facilities and making its aesthetic more chic is good for everyone, not just Airbnb users, and the cost of the remodeling and upkeep is already built into long-term residents’ fees, Diffenderfer says. “With a better understanding of Niido, I think residents will be really happy with what we’ve come up with,” she says. According to Niido, tenants don’t have a choice; objection to Airbnb’s presence isn’t valid grounds for them to break their leases.At least a few are happy to welcome more visitors into the neighborhood, if not their own homes. “I am a traveler at heart, so the idea of having other travelers around is exciting to me,” says Christian Matarazzo, who works for a nearby hotel company. “I think people will come around to the Airbnb partnership because it’s a great opportunity.” But for others, blurring the lines between home and hotel poses the biggest problem. “I work all day in the tourism industry,” Crane says. “I don’t want to come home to the tourism industry.”'),\n",

       "  'Comcast has a plan, but does Charter?PHOTOGRAPHER: ANDREY RUDAKOV/BLOOMBERGComcast Corp. and Charter Communications Inc. want to distance themselves from the word “cable.” It’s led Comcast to go on the merger offensive, but Charter’s plans remain nebulous. Judging by their stock prices, investors aren’t satisfied with either one’s strategy:Comcast and Charter are two of the worst performers among a basket of S&P 500 media stocks this yearData: Bloomberg; graphic by Bloomberg GadflyThe two dominant U.S. cable providers reported first-quarter results this week, and both predictably suffered video subscriber losses that were more than offset by customers who signed up for their internet offerings. While this has been the trend for some time and both companies will continue to generate substantial cash flow from these services, broadband growth is naturally slowing. To the extent that investors care about growth and not just milking the customers they have for as long as they can, Charter CEO Tom Rutledge needs to better communicate how he envisions the company’s future.Charter and Comcast are adding internet users as TV customers cut the cord. Here are their net changes in subscriber counts:Data: Bloomberg Intelligence; graphic by Bloomberg GadflyIt’s clear where Comcast CEO Brian Roberts stands: bigger is better. Comcast on Wednesday formalized a counteroffer for British broadcaster Sky Plc, which is also being pursued by Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox Inc. together with Walt Disney Co. Comcast’s bid is below Sky’s market price, leading us at Gadfly to wonder about Roberts’s true motives. Whatever the case, it’s clear that Comcast is actively pursuing some big internal and external growth opportunities, and doing so at the risk of rattling shareholders who generally prefer share buybacks over needing to reroute funds to bondholders to pay down deal debt. Aside from its M&A actions, Comcast also introduced a wireless service about a year ago called Xfinity Mobile, which had 577,000 customer lines at the end of the first quarter, about a third of which were added in the period. Last May, Comcast and Charter had formed an alliance as part of their tip-toeing into the wireless market. But since then, very little has been heard from Charter on the mobile front. During the first quarter, Charter said it spent just $8 million on “mobile launch costs.” Rutledge told conference-call listeners Friday that it’s on track to launch its new mobile services in the middle of this year. Nevertheless, Charter’s stock dropped 14 percent to its lowest price in more than 17 months. Shareholders are looking at the cable declines and the fact that Charter added fewer internet customers than expected, and they’re nervous. The market for TV-streaming apps may be messy, confusing and ultimately not saving customers much money, but plenty of them are being lured away from old-school cable and satellite packages. Rich Greenfield, an analyst at BTIG LLC, resurfaced this faux pas that Rutledge made during a November 2016 earnings call: In defending costly cable bundles, Rutledge said folks not opting for these packages tend to be “lower-income.” Oops. Take a look at this chart:The other cloud over Charter is what role, if any, it will have in M&A, which has swept through the pay-TV, wireless and media industries. It bought rival Time Warner Cable two years ago, rebranding its product as Spectrum, and has since been thought to be a logical suitor for T-Mobile US Inc. or, to a lesser extent, Sprint Corp. But now that T-Mobile and Sprint, the No. 3 and 4 U.S. wireless carriers, are back in merger talks that are reportedly heating up, will Charter get left in the cold? Does its top shareholder, famed dealmaker John Malone, have any tricks up his sleeve? Rutledge said Friday that he thinks “the Charter story is fully intact and getting better as a result of” the expansion into the wireless market. Perhaps. But he’s not telling that story very well.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.'),\n",

       "  '2018-04-16',\n",
       "  \"When people assess the financial health of big companies, it's easy to get lost in numerical minutiae. Let me point out just two numbers for Netflix Inc.: $28 billion and $279 million.The former is the amount of cash Netflix is obligated to pay in coming years for its streaming video programming, to repay money the company has borrowed, to make lease payments for its offices and more. That sounds like a lot, and it is. Sure, other media and entertainment companies are on the hook for far more money, largely for the expensive endeavor of creating or buying television programming or movies. Walt Disney Co., for example, has committed to spending $92 billion in coming years, mostly to repay debt and from payments it owes sports organizations to televise games. That takes us to the second Netflix number. That $279 million is Netflix's highest-ever free cash flow, or the amount Netflix generates from its normal business operations minus what it spends on large projects such as an expansion of its corporate headquarters.And that peak amount was in 2009, well before Netflix embarked on a global expansion that now means the company's cash expenses exceed annual incoming cash by billions of dollars. (Netflix does report a profit on its income statement because it spreads out the costs of programming over several years. The $28 billion in Netflix's contractual obligations is for future programming that's largely not yet reflected on its income statement.)Netflix's free cash flow has turned negative as the company splurges on programming and an international expansionData: Bloomberg; graphic by Bloomberg GadflyNote: Netflix defines free cash flow as cash from operations minus capital expenditures, acquisitions of DVD content assets and change in other assets. Figure for 2018 is an estimate.In principle, those two Netflix numbers are related to each other. A company tends to rely on the cash generated by its business to pay its bills. But Netflix can't and won't pay its own way. At its peak year of free cash flow, it would take Netflix 100 years to pay all the money it has committed to spend. To use Disney as a yardstick again, that company generated an annual peak of $8.72 billion in free cash flow in its fiscal year ended Sept. 30. Its contractually owed payments are about 10.5 times its highest-ever free cash flow.No one expects Netflix to take a century to pay its bills. Netflix supporters expect the company to grow so large and powerful that it will eventually generate far more cash than it spends and will be able to pay for all the programming and other goodies it agreed to buy. Contrasting Netflix's cash generation -- or lack thereof -- and the hard cash it owes in coming years is meant to illustrate the gamble Netflix is taking with investors' money rather than its own. Netflix owes $28 billion in coming years to pay for programming, its debt and other contractual commitmentsData: Netflix disclosures as of Dec. 31; graphic by Bloomberg GadflyNetflix has been able to splurge on hiring Hollywood stars and releasing a flood of new series and movies because the company has been able to borrow money cheaply. That long-term debt -- which now stands at $6.5 billion -- is how Netflix is expected to finance itself for several more years at least. Analysts at Bloomberg Intelligence say Netflix may look to sell about $2 billion in new bonds after it reports quarterly earnings on Monday. (The company also has $2.8 billion in cash sitting in its vaults.)The more Netflix relies on borrowing to sustain its growth, the more pressure it faces to keep growing to make sure it can pay what it owes. That bet could turn out fine as long as Netflix continues to lure more customers to pay for its streaming video subscriptions and as long as investors are happy to lend Netflix money. The company has been transparent about its need to borrow money for the foreseeable future to pay its bills. Netflix has not, however, been forced to explain what it will do if those twin conditions of fast subscriber growth and easy-to-borrow cash should change. Netflix is trying to capitalize on unique moments for both financial markets and consumer entertainment habits. With few easy ways to produce returns, investors have been happy to lend money to fast-growing, cash-burning companies. And Netflix is trying to seize on people's willingness to turn to internet video to while away their leisure hours. Let's hope it doesn't take 100 years to know whether Netflix and its investors are making a savvy bet, or a ruinous one. \"),\n",

Its contracts with music companies are confidential, but generally the business pays the owners of song rights a fee for each paying user or a percentage of company revenue.In some cases, the royalties it pays decline as it signs up more subscribers or reaches other milestones, according to company disclosures. Spotify also says it pays a lower rate per user from student and family subscriptions. All of this makes it tough to know when the company might reverse years of operating losses. (Spotify, however, did end last year with more cash on hand than it started with.) A representative for Spotify declined to comment, citing regulatory restrictions ahead of its market listing.Spotify can’t challenge the royalties paradigm, because it’s at the mercy of a few power brokers who control popular music. The three major record labels—Sony Music Entertainment, Universal Music Group, and Warner Music Group—and a consortium of independents hold the rights to almost 9 out of every 10 songs streamed on Spotify. Walt Disney Co. could yank its movies from Netflix, and it wouldn’t be a death blow. One major record label pulling out of Spotify could be devastating.Company executives have said that increasing its subscriber numbers will improve its economics. “Scale” is their magic word. But Spotify knows it can’t rely only on subscriptions. That’s why, at the end of its three-hour investor pitch, its top finance officer—Barry McCarthy, the one who worked at Netflix—made it clear that expectations for an improving profit margin were predicated on developing other revenue sources, such as selling advertising to promoters hunting for fans or music-listening data to record labels and concert promoters. The company has already managed to negotiate a decrease in the fees it pays, and its gross profit margin improved last year as a result.The service and its suppliers know they can’t live without each other, and that could help Spotify lower costs even further. The company could take a cue from Netflix and bypass the music labels by signing up musicians directly. But this is an area where Spotify resists the Netflix analogy for fear of panicking the labels, says Mark Mulligan, a media and technology analyst with Midia Research.So Spotify wants to be compared to Netflix, except when it doesn’t. Mostly, the comparison doesn’t hold up.\\n\\nShira Ovide is a columnist for Bloomberg Gadfly.\\n  '),\n",
       " ('Prince Alwaleed Reveals Secret Deal Struck to Exit Ritz After 83 Days',\n",
       "  '2018-03-20',\n",
       "  'Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal in his penthouse office suite in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.Prince Alwaleed bin Talal has taken a few knocks en route to becoming the richest investor in the Middle East and one of Saudi Arabia’s most recognizable faces. In the 1980s, he went broke. In 2008, during the financial crisis, he lost billions of dollars on Citigroup Inc. But nothing compares with the humiliation he sustained over the past few months. Last November, Alwaleed’s uncle, King Salman, and his cousin, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, engineered a government roundup of alleged fraudsters, embezzlers, and money launderers that landed Alwaleed in Riyadh’s now-infamous Ritz-Carlton hotel. He didn’t leave for 83 days.I saw Alwaleed in late October, the week before he became a prisoner of the state. We spent an evening at his desert camp chatting about the financial markets and U.S. politics, watching a soccer match on TV, taking a walk through the sands, and eating a late dinner in the cool midnight air. Seven weeks after his release, in mid-March, I returned to the kingdom. Alwaleed had decided to break his silence and grant me an interview on Bloomberg Television.We met informally the day before the interview at his palace in Riyadh. As I waited in the foyer, the prince descended the grand staircase from the second floor. He was dressed casually in a beige thobe, brown wool sports jacket, and sandals, and he struck me as relaxed. Over the next two hours, between sips of Arabic coffee and ginger tea, while his five granddaughters sang and danced to Katy Perry’s Hot n Cold in the palace gym, he recounted his ordeal.In the early hours of Nov. 4, Alwaleed, at his desert camp for the weekend, received a phone call summoning him to the royal court. He left at once, without any inkling he was walking into a trap. Soon government officials were leaking the sensational details of an anticorruption purge, with news reports pinpointing Alwaleed as the most prominent among hundreds of tycoons, government ministers, and other princes who were being detained at the Ritz-Carlton. Shares of his main company, Kingdom Holding Co., plummeted 21 percent in three days.Alwaleed was quite the prize for a government eager to show its people that no Saudi was exempt from an ongoing crackdown on freeloading and graft: His fortune of $17.1 billion places him 65th on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. And his international profile—forged through friendships and business partnerships with the likes of Bill Gates and Rupert Murdoch—rivals that of Prince Mohammed. Kingdom Holding’s portfolio includes Four Seasons Hotels & Resorts, Citigroup, Euro Disney, and Twitter. Rotana Group, which he controls separately, is the Arab world’s largest entertainment company.The government offered detainees a stark choice: pay up, sign an admission of guilt, and walk free—or refuse and languish. According to a Wall Street Journal report, the price for Alwaleed’s release was $6 billion. Negotiations were held in secret, and the government never disclosed any charges or produced any evidence. Critics said that due process was being denied and accused Prince Mohammed of conducting an intimidation campaign or simply a shakedown under the guise of fighting corruption.Rumors of mistreatment and even torture at the Ritz-Carlton began to swirl, finding their way into reports by the Daily Mail Online and regional news media. So when the prince, still at the hotel, surfaced in a smartphone video in late January, after more than 2½ months of confinement, appearing underfed and haggard, the speculation only intensified. He said he was being treated decently. No one believed it. (Others may not have fared as well. More recently the New York Times reported, citing anonymous sources, that some detainees were physically abused and otherwise coerced into confessions, and that one military officer in custody died bearing signs of a brutal beating.)Since his release, hours after the video was shot, Alwaleed has regained some weight, and he seems as energetic, intense, and engaged as ever. But in conversation it’s clear he’s struggling mightily with the experience. Even if he’s innocent—and he insists he is—the government lumped him in with a group it cast largely as a bunch of crooks. And to complain about that or otherwise fall out of line is to invite a wrath he’s witnessed all too closely.We recorded the interview on a makeshift set in Alwaleed’s apartment on the 67th floor of Riyadh’s Kingdom Tower. Walking in, I wondered how candid he could be. Would he be forthcoming about life inside the Ritz-Carlton? If he’d been harmed, would he admit it? Had he been forced to accept a devil’s bargain to win his release? Would he be credible? What if the government had threatened him? Would I be able to tell?The following is an excerpted version of our conversation, lightly edited for clarity.Alwaleed’s detention was more mysterious than most. Of all the princes who were brought in, he alone hadn’t served in the Saudi government, where kickbacks are considered common. And unlike other businessmen, he wasn’t a government contractor and so couldn’t have overbilled the state. He made most of his wealth transparently, in real estate and as an investor in public markets.Erik Schatzker: Why were you arrested in the first place?Prince Alwaleed: Well, I would not use the word “arrested,” because we were invited to the king’s house and then asked to go to the Ritz-Carlton. So it was done with honor and dignity, and our prestige was maintained. Not only me; everybody else.So the word “arrest” is fair to use for those who did commit a crime, admit their guilt?Exactly. And reached a settlement with the government. But in my case, you know, it’s very much different.So were there never any charges? Were you ever accused of anything?There were no charges. Because I have a fiduciary responsibility to my shareholders in Kingdom Holding, to my friends in Saudi Arabia, and to the world community, because we have international investments all over the place, it’s very important to say that there was zero accusation and zero guilt.You’ve described the whole ordeal as a misunderstanding. A misunderstanding over what?When I say misunderstanding, it’s because I believe I shouldn’t have been there. Now that I’ve left, I would say that I’ve been vindicated. Yet I have to acknowledge to you, for the first time, that yes, we do have with the government a confirmed understanding, going forward.What does that mean?It is very confidential. I cannot get into that. But there is a confirmed understanding between the kingdom of Saudi Arabia and me personally.Does that require you to do certain things?Not necessarily. I cannot get into that, because it is confidential and secret between me and the government. But rest assured that this does not really handcuff me.What did the government want from you?I will not get into the discussions that took place between me and representatives of the government.They must have wanted something.I read what was written, that they wanted a chunk of A or B or C of what I have. This was all rumors.According to one report, it was $6 billion.I read $6 billion, I read more than that and less than that.Did it cost you anything to leave? Did you have to pay the government any money, did you have to hand over any land, did you have to surrender any shares?When I say it’s a confidential and secret agreement, an arrangement based on a confirmed understanding between me and the government of Saudi Arabia, you have to respect that.I’m a Saudi citizen. But I’m also a member of the royal family. The king is my uncle. Mohammed bin Salman is my cousin. So my interest is in maintaining the relationship between us and keeping it unscratched.You maintain your innocence. You say you didn’t sign a settlement acknowledging guilt and that you’re different.We signed something, yes, a confirmed understanding. Some others may call it a settlement. I don’t call it a settlement, because settlement to me is an acknowledgment you’ve done something wrong.You realize, of course, how important it is to be candid and honest with me about this, because the circle of knowledge is too wide. If a different story emerges, your credibility will suffer.Sure.So everything you’ve told me is 100 percent true?I have a confirmed understanding with the government, and it’s ongoing. I’ll elaborate on that: It’s an ongoing process with the government.Already, Kingdom Holding is talking to lenders about getting as much as $2 billion in debt financing—“firepower,” the prince says, for his next deal.This whole ordeal has affected your reputation. People will still believe, no matter what you tell me, that because you were in the Ritz-Carlton you must be guilty of something. You must realize that.When you are detained, for sure some of the business community, some of the banking community will say they have doubts. That’s my job right now, to interact, to meet with all of them individually or jointly and tell my story.I understand it’s not going to be easy at all, because some banks and some people in the business community will be doubtful. They’ll say, “What’s going on?” However, I assure them that everything is normal, everything is back to normal, and that we are functioning as we were before.It would surely help if the government said, “Alwaleed did nothing wrong, it was a misunderstanding, he paid nothing to leave, he remains a Saudi citizen in good standing.” That hasn’t happened.All of these points were covered in the confirmed understanding, the agreement between me and the government.The fact that I’m speaking to you right now, and I’m saying everything truthfully and honestly, and the fact the government is not going to say, “Alwaleed is wrong,” is an approval of what I’m saying.So you feel you need to speak out to, what, clear your name, because you’ve been maligned?I need to clear my name, No.\\u20091, and to clear up a lot of the lies. For example, when they said that I was tortured, I was sent to a prison, you know, during my 83 days in the Ritz-Carlton hotel. All these were lies. I stayed there the whole time. I was never tortured.Across three months, 381 Saudis were hauled in and locked up at the Ritz-Carlton, which boasts 492 rooms, 52 acres of land, and 62,000 feet of conference space. Many left quickly. Alwaleed’s stay was among the longest. The prince says he was kept in Room 628, a 4,575-square-foot royal suite.How did you spend your time?A lot of sports, a lot of walking, a lot of meditation, a lot of watching news, a lot of praying.What was a typical day like?I would go to sleep at 6, 7 o’clock [a.m.] and then wake up around noon. We prayed five times a day.You had access to television, to newspapers?I had access to everything, everything.So no one on the outside knew what was happening inside, but those of you on the inside knew everything about what was happening on the outside?Exactly. That’s why I was able to get information about this so-called torture.So you were not harmed or mistreated in any way?Not one iota.You’re certain that nobody else who was at the Ritz-Carlton suffered anything akin to abuse, torture, wasn’t even roughed up?Maybe someone tried to run away or do something crazy. Maybe he was put down and controlled. Maybe. But for sure there was nothing you could call systematic torturing.Were you allowed to talk to other detainees?No. No two people in the Ritz-Carlton could talk to each other. Even in my case. I did not see anyone. I did not talk to anyone.You were allowed to make some phone calls. To whom and under what conditions?I made my calls to my son, to my daughter and my granddaughters. And I talked to the heads of my companies, the CEO of Kingdom Holding, the head of my private office, and the secretary general of my foundation.Were those calls being monitored?Most likely, yes.For more than 70 years, the Saudi throne passed from one brother to another, but Salman broke with the past, first giving his son control over several government portfolios, then elevating him last year to crown prince. Prince Mohammed’s plans include Vision 2030, an economic program that may see Saudi Aramco, the world’s largest oil company, go public. Movie theaters, banned since the early 1980s, are back, and in parts of Riyadh women walk without an abaya covering their heads. Starting in June, they’ll be permitted to drive for the first time since 1990.What was it like being held captive by your own cousin?It was not easy, I have to confess. It’s not easy to be held against your will. But when I left, I had a very strange feeling. I gathered all the senior officers in my companies and all my close confidants and I told them, “I swear to you I have complete serenity, complete comfort, and no grudge and no bad feelings at all.”And sure enough, within 24 hours we were back in communication with the king’s office, with the crown prince and his people. That’s a very strange situation. But it’s a fact.That’s because you simply had to move forward?No. I’m a nationalist. I’m patriotic. I believe in my country. So I’m not going to have this, this irritation that happened to me create a vendetta and turn me against my uncle, my cousin, my nation, and my people.How would you describe your relationship with Prince Mohammed?It’s stronger. That’s shocking to many people, even to my people.You’ve forgiven him?I’ve forgotten and forgiven the whole process completely. It’s behind me.How often are you and he in contact?Barely three days go by without me texting or calling or talking to him.You and he talk almost every three days?We text a lot, but we talk less frequently. Barely a week goes without us communicating.Prince Mohammed has a grand plan for the transformation of the Saudi economy and Saudi society. Do you remain supportive?Yes. His vision took a lot of my ideas, but he multiplied them. I had the sovereign wealth fund idea, I talked about Aramco going public. Women’s rights, women competing in society, women driving, all of these things I called for.He’s establishing a new era in Saudi Arabia. Any person who does not support what Mohammed bin Salman is doing right now, I say, is a traitor.The crown prince has also become the biggest Saudi investor, plowing tens of billions of state dollars into Uber Technologies Inc. and funds run by Blackstone Group and SoftBank Group.Does the government want you building and maintaining relationships with heads of state and CEOs of multinational companies?When I left, there were zero conditions on me, which means life as usual. I’ve been in touch with many heads of states, in Europe and the Middle East. Everything’s normal.Can you travel?Sure I can.Do you know whether the government is monitoring your whereabouts?I’m not worried about that.And your bank accounts?Everything’s back to normal.You’re looking for foreign investments and so is the Public Investment Fund, Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund.  Doesn’t that put you in competition?Actually, we’re in touch with the government to be involved in many projects. They’re going to have a big project in the Red Sea with Maldives-type resorts. Four Seasons was invited to be there. We’ve also been invited to be part of another project in Riyadh, where there’s going to be a huge entertainment center. You know, Disney-type.We’re in hotels, we’re in media and in entertainment, so we’re invited. So no, no competition, we complement each other.What about co-investment? Will the PIF invest together with Kingdom Holding, or perhaps Rotana, or Prince Alwaleed personally?Yes, this will happen. We’re in discussions right now with the PIF on certain projects.Domestic projects or international ventures?Domestically, to begin with.The crown prince is touring the West. He’s meeting President Trump at the White House, and he’s trying to attract capital to Saudi Arabia. Given your experience at the Ritz-Carlton, how good can you feel about presenting a common front with the government, the very same government that put you in the hotel?I’m supportive of Saudi Arabia, supportive of my government, supportive of King Salman and Prince Mohammed bin Salman all the way. Before, during, and after detention.People will find that hard to understand.They don’t understand that you’re talking to a person who is a member of the royal family. We’re all one party here. One party. The ruling family of Saudi Arabia.I understand it sounds weird to people. They’ll say, “You’ve been detained by the king and by the crown prince and you’re still supporting them?” You bet.You have to wonder how comfortable CEOs will be investing in Saudi Arabia after seeing the Ritz-Carlton method of dealing with disputes.They have to decide that. But I can speak on my own behalf, and I can tell you it’s business as usual: We’re going to invest in Saudi Arabia. '),\n",

       "  '2018-03-14',\n",
       "  'Jesus Corona (17) of Mexico battles for possession against Panama’s Adolfo Machado (13) during a FIFA World Cup qualifier in Mexico City.Fox Sports broadcaster Fernando Fiore spent the hours after the U.S. failed to qualify for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in October interviewing dejected players about their stunning 2-1 loss to Trinidad and Tobago. It was the most embarrassing moment for U.S. soccer in more than 30 years. A long day’s work over, Fiore, a veteran soccer announcer, returned to his hotel in Trinidad. Only then did his thoughts turn to his employer. “That’s when I realized: Oh, my God, we don’t have the U.S. national team.”Seven years earlier, Fox had paid a record $400 million to pry away the English-language rights to the 2018 and 2022 World Cups from Walt Disney Co.’s ESPN/ABC. A big draw was the U.S. team, which accounted for four of the five most-watched matches on ESPN/ABC during the 2014 tournament. In October a person close to Fox estimated that U.S. soccer’s absence could cost the network $10 million to $20 million in ad sales. While sales are on target so far, the source says, prices for spots in the last-minute market could suffer.Telemundo, the Spanish-language broadcast network owned by NBCUniversal, is also grieving the loss. It paid about $600 million for the 2018 and 2022 competitions, outbidding Univision Communications Inc., which had aired the World Cup since 1970. The U.S. team isn’t as important to the Spanish-language audience, but its failure was a disappointment. In 2014 viewership was 44 percent higher for matches featuring the U.S. team than for other early-round games on Univision.The U.S. collapse makes the Mexican national team the main attraction for Fox and Telemundo, setting up an intense competition for tens of millions of bilingual viewers. America’s fast-growing Hispanic population is the most obvious audience to court, especially as viewing habits change. Thirty-six percent, or 21 million, of the 58 million Hispanics in the U.S. are fluent in English and Spanish, according to the Pew Research Center, a number that jumps to 50 percent for second-generation Americans. Fifty-four percent of all Hispanics in the country consume news weekly in both languages.“The bilingual audience is a battlefield,” says John Guppy, founder of Gilt Edge Soccer Marketing. “I bet you both Telemundo and Fox feel like they can win a decent share.”The morning after the U.S. loss, Fox Sports President Eric Shanks and John Entz, head of production, met with their senior soccer staff in Los Angeles. Their message: Full speed ahead. Fox considered Mexico a second home team and had been preparing expansive coverage of “El Tri,” as the team is known, referring to its tricolor flag.“Because Mexico had always been Team 1B in our planning, we already had a plan in place when the U.S. team was eliminated,” said World Cup executive producer David Neal, who spent 18 months at Univision before joining Fox. “It was a luxury for us not having to start from ground zero.”To court the team’s fans, Fox has hired a number of journalists and executives well-versed in Spanish-language soccer coverage. The lineup includes former Mexico defender Mariano Trujillo; Jorge Pérez-Navarro, a longtime play-by-play voice of Univision; Rodolfo Landeros, a journalist with deep connections to Mexico’s players; and Fiore, a well-known studio analyst who had been at Univision.Fiore’s on-camera antics are familiar to those who watch Spanish-language soccer broadcasts. Less so to his new Fox colleagues. During one of his early broadcasts, Fiore walked off the set in feigned frustration with co-hosts Alexi Lalas and Herculez Gomez. He was kidding; it was a stunt he’d pulled before at other networks. Lalas and Gomez, however, thought he was genuinely offended, and after an awkward silence, the telecast cut to commercial.“In my previous job they knew my style, I could leave in the middle and they knew,” Fiore said. “Culturally, that’s a part of us.”Citing internal research, Telemundo says 1 in 4 non-Latino soccer fans plans to watch the World Cup in Spanish. “Listening to soccer in a Romance language just works,” says Jim Bell, executive producer of Telemundo’s World Cup coverage. “You can follow the action, the names are the same, and gol is ‘goal.’\\u2009” The cable network is also banking on the distinctive style of its announcers, including lead play-by-play man Andrés Cantor, famous for his elongated goal calls. “We bring passion and excitement to the play-by-play that is very different from our English-speaking counterparts,” says Cantor, who called World Cup games for Univision in 1990, 1994, and 1998. After those tournaments, he says, English-only speakers told him they preferred watching games in Spanish.Telemundo is looking to its corporate parent, NBCUniversal, to get in front of bilingual viewers. Cantor appeared in a 10-second promo during NBC’s coverage of the Super Bowl in February, delivering his signature “goooaaal” call, then dropping his microphone. It was technically a Spanish-language ad—the network is contractually barred from English-language promotion—but its target audience was the entire soccer-watching population. “We’re taking over from a previous incumbent who had these rights for so long,” says Eli Velazquez, executive vice president for programming at Telemundo Deportes. “We need to make sure that everyone knows.”The network’s slogan for the World Cup is “Lo vivimos juntos” (“We live it together”). The idea, says Telemundo Deportes President Ray Warren, is that families watching together will turn to the Spanish broadcaster. “It’s easier for bilinguals to go to Spanish-language telecasts,” he says. “Dad’s watching it. Grandpa’s watching it. And Uncle José is watching it. So we’ve got an advantage there.” But as Gilt Edge’s Guppy sees it, Fox has the advantage with coveted younger audiences. “If you are a 19-year-old bilingual, bicultural, frankly you are not going to sit down and watch the full two-hour match with regularity,” he says. “You are going to watch the highlights. You are going to do it over your phone. I think those people may end up going to Fox.” —With Lucas Shaw'),\n",

       "  '2018-02-20',\n",
       "  'PHOTOGRAPHER: NOLWEN CIFUENTES FOR BLOOMBERG BUSINESSWEEKBlack Panther, the Marvel Studios superhero flick that opened on Friday, is stalking its way into the cultural zeitgeist in ways few movies ever do.The Walt Disney Co.-produced picture, the first big Hollywood action movie with a majority black cast, took in an estimated $242 million over the four-day Presidents Day weekend in North America and $426.6 million worldwide, roaring past projections and putting it on track to be one of the top-grossing films of the year. Even before its release, the film was breaking records: Fandango, the online ticket-selling site, said Black Panther generated more advance sales than any film without “Star Wars” in its title. More than half of all African Americans in the country intended to see the movie in a theater, according to the polling firm YouGov Omnibus.Elizabeth Frank, chief content and programming officer for AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc., the nation’s largest theater chain, says the film drew way more than the typical Thursday night “fanboy” crowd, pulling in families and other groups for Sunday matinees. Many arrived in superhero costumes or traditional African ensembles. “The most exciting part about the sales we have on Black Panther right now is that they are big and they are broad,” she says.For the movie theater industry, which saw attendance fall to a 25-year low in 2017, Black Panther delivered a long-awaited shot in the arm. Many of last year’s most disappointing releases were franchises and sequels, and for Disney, the 18th film in what the company calls its Marvel Cinematic Universe represents an effort to promote characters beyond the stalwarts Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America. Disney devoted $200 million to the film, the highest production budget for a Marvel nonsequel. “This is the beginning of the next era for Marvel movies,” says Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at the research site Box Office Pro.Black Panther tells the story of T’Challa, an African prince endowed with superpowers played by Chadwick Boseman (Get On Up, 42), who returns to his fictional homeland of Wakanda to thwart an evil rival played by Michael B. Jordan, who worked with director Ryan Coogler on both of his previous feature films: 2013’s Fruitvale Station and 2015’s Creed. Lupita Nyong’o, who won a best supporting actress Oscar for 12 Years a Slave, plays T’Challa’s love interest. The soundtrack by rapper Kendrick Lamar will likely premiere at No. 1 on the Hot 200 album chart, Billboard predicts.According to Reed Tucker—author of 2017’s Slugfest, about the rivalry between Marvel and DC Comics—legend has it that when the comic book Black Panther was introduced in 1966, Marvel executives thought a black superhero would be too controversial on a cover. In response, Marvel illustrator Jack Kirby designed the character a face-covering mask. “We’ve gone from that to now someone spending hundreds of millions of dollars on a movie where he’s front and center,” Tucker says. “That’s pretty great.” '),\n",

       "  'Mickie James (right) and Natalya at WrestleMania 33 in Orlando on April 2, 2017.The building that houses the headquarters of World Wrestling Entertainment Inc. stands just off Interstate 95 in Stamford, Conn. Its facade is vaguely menacing, a curtain of black glass topped by a Jolly Rogeresque black flag. Inside the lobby, visitors pass by a life-size statue of Andre the Giant, the 7-foot-4-inch, 520-pound superstar of yesteryear. It’s a sensation not unlike strolling under the vast basilica of a Roman temple. Welcome to this divine space, ye slight-statured mortal.On a Friday afternoon in December, Stephanie McMahon, WWE’s chief brand officer, is seated in her office on the top floor. She’s dressed in black, with earrings shaped like daggers. Near her desk is a football signed by New England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski, who last year brandished his meaty deltoids in the ring at WrestleMania 33.McMahon says she’s on a cleanse and hasn’t had coffee for days. The resulting headaches have abated, however, and she riffs exuberantly on the universal modalities of pro wrestling. “The notion of good vs. evil is translatable and one of the oldest stories since the beginning of time,” she says.Lately, while many entertainment companies are being pummeled, WWE has been on a roll. On Feb. 8, the day it announced fourth-quarter earnings, its share price closed at $33.84, up 73 percent from a year earlier and near an all-time high. In 2017, WWE generated $50.6 million of net income on $801 million of revenue, its largest haul ever. The wrestling promotion is also being floated as a potential acquisition target for big media and tech companies hungry for live programming. Brandon Ross, an analyst at BTIG LLC, has suggested that Walt Disney, 21st Century Fox, Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon are among the most likely suitors. “We’ve certainly thought about it,” McMahon says of a possible sale. “It would be foolish not to.”The market’s enthusiasm for WWE stems largely from its lucrative TV contracts, combined with its early success in direct-to-consumer streaming TV apps. In 2014 the company made a risky move, deciding essentially to cannibalize its traditional pay-per-view business. Instead of paying their cable companies one-time fees to see WWE’s marquee events—say, $44.99 for the Royal Rumble—fans would be encouraged to subscribe to a streaming video service, the WWE Network, and pay a monthly fee. After some early turbulence, the move is paying off. Roughly 1.5 million people now hand over $9.99 a month for the WWE Network, making it the 11th-most-popular streaming video service in the U.S., according to Parks Associates, and the second-most-popular, after Major League Baseball’s, in the “sports-related” category.McMahon, 41, is the scion of a pro wrestling dynasty. Her grandfather and great-grandfather were influential promoters in the industry’s early years. During the latter half of the 20th century, her father, Vince McMahon, WWE’s chairman and chief executive officer, transformed the family business from a niche regional attraction into a mainstream brand whose stars—Hulk Hogan, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, John Cena, Dave Bautista—regularly graduate to Hollywood careers.“There was a time when it came across as seedy, kind of playing to barroom brawls,” McMahon says. Those days are over, she asserts. “Our lines of business are really more akin to Disney than they are to anything else.”McMahon is both executive and on-screen performer for WWE. She used to play the boss’s entitled, imperious daughter; now she’s a rancorous commissioner, endlessly bickering with the family’s brawny help. In 2003 she married Paul Levesque, a WWE star who wrestles as Triple H. He’s since joined his wife in the executive ranks, forming the rare media power couple capable of deploying both beatdowns and Chartbeat.With a growing cast of female and international wrestlers, WWE is now plotting to expand its fan base beyond American men. It already has loyal followings in certain overseas markets, but executives say the spread of streaming video and social media has created the perfect conditions for an all-out global invasion. Over the past year, the company has teamed up with streaming service PPTV to offer the WWE Network in China, staged an international talent tryout in Dubai that drew aspirants from 18 countries, put on a 10-day European tour, and teamed up with Fox Sports Mexico to create a Spanish-language show that’s airing throughout Central America and the Caribbean.Overseas audiences account for 70 percent of WWE viewing, McMahon says, yet only 30 percent of its revenue. “So there’s a big opportunity.”WWE is a tightly scripted company. Everything that happens in and out of the ring is by design. The announcers, executives, and wrestlers are constantly imbuing the minutiae of its ever-shifting plotlines with an overarching sense of momentousness, often by playing up the various ways WWE is “making history.” If a wrestler wins a particular title for the first time, the occasion is “historic.” If a matchup features a new twist on an old wrestling format, it’s historic. Special guest referee: historic. Novel promotional poster: historic.In December, when WWE staged two days of live matches in the United Arab Emirates, the incantations of history-in-the-making were especially sustained. Executives say the company is well-positioned to generate more cash in the Arab world in coming years. WWE broadcasts its two weekly live-event TV shows, WWE Raw and WWE SmackDown Live, throughout the Middle East and North Africa via a partnership with OSN, a satellite provider headquartered in the UAE. Last year, OSN premiered a weekly show dedicated entirely to WWE highlights. Its analysis is hosted, in Arabic, by Moein Al Bastaki, a celebrity magician from Dubai, and Nathalie Mamo, a retired basketball player from Lebanon.Roughly once a year, WWE takes its stars on tour in the Middle East and stages live, nontelevised events to stoke interest. December’s show featured a new enticement: the first women’s championship bout in the region. Inside a sports stadium in Abu Dhabi, Alexa Bliss, a pixieish firebrand whose catchphrase is “five feet of fury,” put her title belt on the line against Sasha Banks, aka the Legit Boss, a strapping, loquacious cousin of Snoop Dogg. When they’re wrestling, Banks and Bliss typically wear short shorts and cropped tops, but the UAE has strict dress codes. As a result, Banks and Bliss arrived in the ring wearing long-sleeved, ankle-hugging bodysuits designed for the occasion.The crowd, a mix of men and women, didn’t seem to mind the historic lack of exposed midriff. At one point during the face-slapping, stomach-kicking melee, some in the audience broke out in a feel-good chant: “This is hope. This is hope.” Banks says the reception assuaged her fears that they’d be mocked and left her choked up at the thought of serving as a powerful role model for the young Arab women in the crowd. “I was trying everything in my will not to cry during performing,” she says.“It was history-making for us,” McMahon says.In the early 2000s the WWE’s female wrestlers were often recruited from the ranks of models, and their matches were designed to uncover skin. A “bra and panties” match could be won only by stripping an opponent down to her underwear. From 2008 to 2016, they were called divas. McMahon herself was routinely mocked by male stars such as the Rock (“Big, phony fun bags”) and jeered by crowds (“Slut! Slut! Slut!”).She traces the shift away from this mindset to a 2015 women’s tag-team match that lasted only 30 seconds. “Our fans started a hashtag called #GiveDivasAChance,” she says. Since then, WWE has hired about 40 more women wrestlers, started calling its female performers “superstars” in concert with the men, and unveiled a championship belt with more gravitas and less decorative pink butterfly. McMahon describes the course correction as long overdue. “I never felt great about the way we portrayed our women,” she says. “It was something that I spoke up against for quite some time. But it took me a while to have a stronger voice in the room. Ultimately, the voice that needed to be heard was our fan base.”Not coincidentally, turning women performers into more wholesome, athletic superheroes has made the product more palatable to countries with conservative values—and more appealing to advertisers wary of angry parents. “From a sponsor standpoint, they’re more socially acceptable,” says Dave Meltzer, editor of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter. But, he adds, “there are people who complain to me constantly that they want it like it was back when it was really, really raunchy.”In the ’80s and early ’90s, WWE unleashed a handful of sneering, exotic wrestlers to rile U.S. audiences. The foreigners were inevitably bad guys—menacing, heavily accented personifications of threats to the U.S. from places such as the USSR (Nikolai Volkoff, actually a Croatian) and Iran (the Iron Sheik).Globalization has complicated these storylines. As WWE’s overseas ambitions have grown, so has its need to recruit wrestlers of diverse ethnicities and national origins—and to have some of them perform as heroes. “Forty percent of our talent roster is international,” McMahon says. “We’re looking to grow that.” The jingoism hasn’t entirely disappeared, but the us-vs.-them dynamic has become less clear-cut.“If you did what you did in the ’80s now, it wouldn’t feel right,” says Meltzer. Thanks to YouTube, he points out, foreign wrestlers can gain sizable followings before ever appearing on WWE. And in general, fans today care more about the quality of moves in the ring than the acting outside of it. Fluent acrobatics, he says, matter more than fluent English.This dynamic has played out with India, for example, where company executives say WWE is the second-most-consumed sport after cricket. Last May, Jinder Mahal, a glowering knave with a flair for neckbreakers, was crowned WWE champion, the first of Indian descent. (Mahal, who is Canadian-born, held the title for several months before losing it to A.J. Styles.) In December, at a live exhibition inside a stadium in New Delhi, Mahal shed his turban and wrestled Triple H in front of a frenzied crowd that the Times of India estimated at 8,000. Ultimately, Triple H prevailed. Afterward, he shook hands with Mahal, said it was an honor to wrestle the “Modern Day Maharajah,” and joined him for some in-ring Bhangra moves. The détente was short-lived, though. Before exiting, Triple H pancaked one of Mahal’s minions, heightening the drama for a potential rematch. Your move, cricket.Such events have helped the WWE Network lift its international subscriptions from 44,000 after its first year to roughly 410,000—a level of success that was far from certain when it began in February 2014. At the time, it was unclear if anybody anywhere would pay for a stand-alone pro wrestling network. Most subscription video apps were aggregators such as Netflix, not dedicated to single brands like WWE. “There was not a playbook out there for us to say, ‘Let’s go look at how X, Y, or Z did it,’\\u2009” says Michelle Wilson, WWE’s co-president.The WWE Network has since evolved to include a vast bank of archival footage, marquee events such as WrestleMania, and a hefty slate of exclusive programming. Every Wednesday night, the service streams a show featuring up-and-coming performers from NXT, a developmental league run by Triple H. The WWE Network also hosts an hourlong broadcast of its cruiserweight division, called WWE 205 Live, as well as talk shows and documentaries.The service is available throughout much of the world, and although most programming is English-only, premium events are broadcast in eight languages. The next big phase, executives say, is to tailor the product to local audiences. That means creating local-language highlight shows and continuing to develop and promote local talent. In 2013 the company unveiled the WWE Performance Center, a wrestling school and training facility in Orlando, where WWE takes promising athletes from different disciplines and countries and converts them into all-around stage performers. After impressing WWE brass at the tryouts in Dubai, Shadia Bseiso, a Jordanian jiujitsu competitor, signed a contract and headed to Orlando. McMahon says WWE is considering building a second performance center overseas.Over the years, the company has occasionally had to fend off rival wrestling promotions on TV, most notably World Championship Wrestling (which it later bought) in the 1990s. To date, the WWE Network hasn’t had to face an equivalent challenge from a streaming service, though several overseas promotions are introducing rival products. Tokyo-based New Japan Pro-Wrestling Co. offers a subscription product for 999 yen ($9.20) a month, which is now available in English. New Japan has been building up its appeal to Western viewers, in part by staging a series of buzz-making matches starring WWE legend Chris Jericho.In most of the world, however, WWE has no direct competitors. Perhaps as a result, the company seems confident it can win over local fans without investing huge amounts of money. At the moment it employs seven international general managers, scattered from Shanghai to Singapore to Australia, who oversee regional development and report to Wilson and her co-president, George Barrios. A conquering army it is not, but that might be all right, according to BTIG’s Ross. “You don’t need to put offices in every single country around the world,” he says. “You just need to make a couple of targeted bets on talent in certain core overseas markets.”When the WWE Network made its debut, there was some concern among analysts that it might decimate WWE’s audience on traditional television. So far that hasn’t happened. With Raw and SmackDown Live, WWE continues to air five hours of original wrestling programing each week on USA Network. The ratings have remained strong even as most of cable TV has slumped, with WWE shows consistently ranking among the top 20 most popular of the week.WWE’s current domestic deal with Comcast Corp., which owns the USA Network, is set to expire in 2019. Some analysts say WWE’s next deal will be more lucrative. The company has attracted a broader base of advertisers of late thanks to the growing demand among sponsors for live programming, plus its tamer fare. There may be more competition this time. “We would not be surprised to see tech platform bidders emerge, which have begun to experiment with sports and scripted programming,” Ross wrote in a research note. WWE already has one of the most popular channels on Google’s YouTube, and in December it announced it had sold an original wrestling series that’s appearing exclusively on Facebook.“Facebook could be the most likely destination for WWE content in 2019,” Ross wrote.Later this year, Vince McMahon turns 73. An aging patriarch often spells trouble for a family-run business, but the McMahon clan seems poised to endure. In 2016, after six years away from WWE, Shane McMahon, Stephanie’s older brother, returned. These days, he plays the on-screen commissioner of SmackDown Live and wrestles with a vengeance. “He is really a strong talent for us right now,” says Stephanie—though he isn’t, she points out, an actual executive at the company.For many longtime observers, a WWE without Vince McMahon is hard to imagine. James Clement, an analyst with Macquarie Capital Inc., says that while the family has a “deep bench,” investors would be concerned if he suddenly abdicated the throne. “When there is the first wrestling match on Mars, Vince is probably going to be behind it,” Clement says.For now, the McMahons seem content to beef up their arsenal of female and international wrestlers on planet Earth. In January, WWE held one of its biggest annual events, the Royal Rumble, at Philadelphia’s Wells Fargo Center. Backstage, before the show, Banks, dressed in sweats, rips open two bags of chunk tuna and dumps them into a bowl. The Legit Boss is nervous. “If I try to eat a real meal, I won’t be able to get it down,” she says.The night’s biggest surprise is the unveiling of WWE’s latest high-profile hire, mixed martial arts fighter Ronda Rousey, who will become a full-time wrestler. But the outcomes of the titular events—men’s and women’s versions of a prolonged battle in which 30 combatants try to win a title shot by throwing their opponents over the top rope—raise eyebrows, too. The women’s Royal Rumble is the first-ever, an achievement whose historic nature the announcers don’t shy away from stressing. Stephanie McMahon presides ringside as a guest commentator, while other teams of broadcasters provide live commentary in Spanish, German, Russian, Japanese, Mandarin, Portuguese, and Hindi.Banks sashays onstage in Wonder Woman-style gear as the first entrant; 55 minutes later she’s tossed out of the ring by duplicitous twins. The last wrestler standing is Asuka, a kaleidoscopically styled, fiercely kicking combatant recruited from Japan. Earlier that night her compatriot, Shinsuke Nakamura, won the men’s bout. Introduced only a few years earlier, at press conferences in Tokyo, Asuka and Nakamura will now headline WrestleMania, WWE’s biggest annual show, in front of 75,000 berserk fans in New Orleans this April. Your move, New Japan. '),\n",

       "  \"“Marvel’s Inhumans,” a superhero series that began airing on ABC in September, seemed to have it all. The story of  a royal family of superhumans comes from classic 1960s comics. The cast includes Iwan Rheon, the Welsh actor who played the ultimate bad guy, Ramsay Bolton, on HBO’s “Game of Thrones.” The show got a promotional boost from a unique partnership with the theater chain Imax Corp.The audience didn’t materialize. An average of 1.5 million nightly viewers in the coveted 18-to-49 demographic placed it 87th among broadcast shows. Critics ripped the program for its unimaginative plot and weak characters. “Perhaps, if nothing else, the disaster that is the pilot of ABC’s ‘Marvel’s Inhumans’ will dissuade network executives from the out-of-control trend of superhero shows,” Pittsburgh Post-Gazette critic Rob Owen wrote in his review. Not so fast.The long-running rivalry between Marvel and DC Comics, which began on comic-store shelves and has been most prominent in movie theaters, has now reached the saturation point on television and streaming services. There are more than two dozen superhero shows on the air or in development. The surge is raising the risk of superhero fatigue.DC’s experience with “Supergirl” illustrates the potential limitations of the genre. The show first aired in 2015 on CBS, where it earned 2.4 million average viewers in the key under-50 group. On the CW, where “Supergirl” flew the following year, those numbers aren’t bad. Warner Bros., which owns the show, saved money by clustering the production with other programs it shoots in Vancouver, rather than its original location in Los Angeles. Still, this season the show is down to 1.19 million average viewers.There have already been three cancellations among TV’s superabundance of costumed heroes: “Constantine,” a DC show about an exorcist, died after 13 episodes on NBC in 2015; “Human Target,” a DC show on Fox about a bodyguard who assumes the identities of his clients, was dropped in 2011; and ABC canceled “Agent Carter,” a Captain America spin-off from Marvel, after two short seasons. ABC, which also broadcasts the Marvel-based “Agents of SHIELD,” hasn’t said if it will pick “Inhumans” up for a second season.Channing Dungey, who heads entertainment programming at ABC, said she remains undeterred by the “Inhumans” experience and will continue to delve into the superhero genre. “The question really is more: What kind of superhero show?” she said. “What’s the tone and how are we doing it? I would never say we’re through with superheroes.”While Walt Disney Co.-owned Marvel has seen its superhero films outdraw those from Time Warner Inc.’s DC Comics at the box office, the balance of power appears more even on the small screen. “Marvel obviously gets it really right when it comes to the films—the tone, the characters—they’re giving audiences exactly what they want,” said Reed Tucker, author of “Slugfest,” a book about the comic-book rivals. “In TV, DC does a much better job.”DC’s experience with TV superheroes dates back to “Adventures of Superman” and “Batman” in the 1950s and 1960s. It kicked off the modern era with “Arrow” on the CW channel in 2012. That show, about an archer whose quiver is packed with trick projectiles, is now in its sixth season and anchors the “Arrowverse” of spinoffs on the network, including “The Flash”' and “Legends of Tomorrow.”Indeed, no channel has staked as much on the genre as the CW, a joint venture between Time Warner and CBS Corp. Its newest production, “Black Lightning,” premiered last week featuring an African-American superhero who shoots electricity. If you count “iZombie,” about a crime-fighting zombie with superpowers, the CW now has six superhero shows in production and devotes two full nights of primetime—Mondays and Tuesdays—to the programs.Mark Pedowitz, the CW’s president, said superhero shows have brought the network, whose audience was once 70 percent skewed toward women, a now equal share of male viewers. The strategy hasn't insulated the network from an industrywide slump in ratings, with 18-to-49-year-old viewership down 7.5 percent in the current season. CW’s audience is flat with last season when online and recorded viewing is taken into account, Pedowitz said, and the shows' owners also make money when past seasons are shown by Netflix Inc.Superhero shows in general attract a young, male audience that’s hard for advertisers to reach outside of sports, according to Chris Geraci, who helped direct some $5 billion in ads for clients of the Omnicom media agency OMD. Because superhero programs are based on established characters and can be cross-promoted with related shows, they are somewhat safer bets than the typical new show. “You sort of have a built-in audience,” Geraci said.While superhero shows have struggled on the big broadcast networks, they seem to have found a better home on streaming services, where the language and plot lines can get edgier. In 2013, Marvel announced with great fanfare that it was producing four shows and a miniseries to run on Netflix. It was a strategy modeled after Marvel’s super-successful “cinematic universe,” with interlocking plots and sharing of characters. The collaboration produced some of the most critically acclaimed superhero shows in “Daredevil” and “Jessica Jones.”The Marvel-Netflix relationship is in flux now that Disney is looking to produce new content for its own online video service launching in 2019. “We obviously want the Marvel Television series currently on Netflix to have a long and lauded run,” Dan Buckley, president of Marvel Entertainment, said in an email. New projects, he added, would seek out “networks and platforms that are the best fit for that content, including the Disney-branded streaming service.”\\n\\nThere’s likely to be even more superhero shows ahead. Disney Chief Executive Robert Iger has said that gaining more control over superhero franchises such as the X-Men, Fantastic Four and Deadpool was part of the thinking behind his $52.4 billion acquisition of the entertainment assets of 21st Century Fox.Still, even such stalwarts as the CW are learning there are limits to what TV superheroes can sustain. There was much less competition six years ago, when “Arrow” made its debut, Pedowitz said, and now he won’t have more than four superhero shows on his air at any one time.But he also doesn’t see an end to the superhero race. “The audience will tell you when the fatigue has set in,” Pedowitz said. “If you have a quality show or a fun show, the audience will stay with it.”\"),\n",

       "  'ILLUSTRATION: PATRICK LEGER FOR BLOOMBERG BUSINESSWEEKA year ago, before the investor lawsuits and the federal investigations, before the mass resignations, and before the connotation of the word “Uber” shifted from “world’s most valuable startup” to “world’s most dysfunctional,” Uber’s executives sat around a hotel conference room table in San Francisco, trying to convince their chief executive officer, Travis Kalanick, that the company had a major problem: him.The executives were armed that day with something unusual for Uber Technologies Inc.: the results of a survey. Kalanick operated by gut feeling and with a stubborn sense of how people should feel, not how they did. Jeff Jones, Uber’s new president and former chief marketing officer for Target Corp., wanted more substantial insights. Conclusions drawn from the survey were printed and hanging on the walls. About half the respondents had a positive impression of Uber and its convenient ride-hailing app. But if respondents knew anything about Kalanick, an inveterate flouter of both workplace conventions and local transportation laws, they had a decidedly negative view.As usual with Kalanick, the discussion grew contentious. Jones and his deputies argued that Uber’s riders and drivers viewed the company as made up of a bunch of greedy, self-centered jerks. And as usual, Kalanick retorted that the company had a public-relations problem, not a cultural one.Then a top executive excused herself to answer a phone call. A minute later, she reappeared and asked Kalanick to step into the hallway. Another executive joined them. They hunched over a laptop to watch a video that had just been posted online by Bloomberg News: grainy, black-and-white dashcam footage of Kalanick in the back seat of an UberBlack on Super Bowl weekend, heatedly arguing over fares with a driver named Fawzi Kamel.“Some people don’t like to take responsibility for their own shit!” Kalanick can be heard yelling at Kamel. “They blame everything in their life on somebody else!”As the clip ended, the three stood in stunned silence. Kalanick seemed to understand that his behavior required some form of contrition. According to a person who was there, he literally got down on his hands and knees and began squirming on the floor. “This is bad,” he muttered. “I’m terrible.”Then, contrition period over, he got up, called a board member, demanded a new PR strategy, and embarked on a yearlong starring role as the villain who gets his comeuppance in the most gripping startup drama since the dot-com bubble. It’s a story that, until now, has never been fully told.The melodrama began, in a sense, with Donald Trump. On Jan. 27 the newly inaugurated president issued his executive order imposing border restrictions on people from seven Muslim countries. Outrage erupted. People took to the streets; tech workers in Silicon Valley walked out of their offices in symbolic protest. And in New York, a small union called the New York Taxi Workers Alliance declared that there would be no taxi pickups from 6 p.m. to 7 p.m. on Saturday night at John F. Kennedy International Airport.For Uber, that would create extra demand at the airport, which meant it could charge more—but this would probably cause a backlash. That had happened before when the company let its “surge pricing” algorithms do their thing. So the New York managers decided to be good citizens and suspend surge pricing for the night.The backlash hit anyway. After years of negative revelations—spying on passengers, dubious driverless-car experiments in San Francisco, the CEO’s bragging about sexual conquests, to name just a few—the public was already inclined to believe the worst of Uber. If the company wasn’t price gouging this time, maybe it was trying to break up the JFK strike. A new hashtag was trending on Twitter: #deleteuber. Users deleted their accounts by the thousands. Lyft Inc., the rival service that branded itself the anti-Uber, capitalized on the moment and donated $1 million to the American Civil Liberties Union.Further stoking the flames was Kalanick’s decision to join Trump’s business advisory council. Kalanick argued that his participation in the council wasn’t an endorsement of the president; he just wanted a seat at the table, along with Elon Musk, International Business Machines Corp.’s Ginni Rometty, and Walt Disney Co.’s Bob Iger. But intentions didn’t seem to matter. Criticism from riders and drivers intensified, and Kalanick spent days talking to his executives about what to do. They considered whether he should go to the first meeting and find some pretense to object and leave; he even floated the idea of wearing a protest T-shirt to the council meeting, according to people familiar with the discussions.Ultimately, Kalanick decided the whole thing wasn’t worth the trouble and his minders set up a call so he could politely say no to Trump. A chronic pacer, Kalanick walked away from his desk at the appointed time. The first call from the White House came—and went to Kalanick’s voicemail. Then came the second call. Trump was on the line, and Kalanick walked into a glass-walled conference room to deliver the news. The conversation apparently went as one would expect. Kalanick emerged to tell his colleagues that the president was “super un-pumped.”In mid-February, an engineer named Susan Fowler penned a blog post, “Reflecting on One Very, Very Strange Year at Uber,” about the sexual harassment she had witnessed in her time at the company. The explosive response to that post prompted Kalanick to hire Eric Holder Jr., the former U.S. attorney general and a partner at the firm Covington & Burling LLP, to lead an investigation into Fowler’s claims. “We will leave no stones unturned,” Holder told Bloomberg News at the start of his inquiry. “This company has one opportunity to get this right.”But the hits kept coming. The infamous dashcam footage surfaced; a few weeks later, the New York Times reported on a secret Uber technology called Greyball, which the company developed to identify and deny service to riders who had violated the company’s contractual terms. In some cities and countries, Uber managers used Greyball to avoid picking up taxi inspectors and other law enforcement officials who might want to ticket drivers or shut the service down.A common factor in all these crises was Kalanick’s unrelenting combativeness. In meetings, he would alternately impress and alienate employees, investors, and his board. Over time, he turned a lot of friends into enemies with stories to tell. Jones, the president who had commissioned the public survey, resigned in March after only six months on the job, citing differences over “beliefs and approach to leadership.” In exit interviews with Uber board members, he was more specific, excoriating Kalanick’s shotgun management style and unwillingness to listen. Jones seemed so eager to leave the company that he declined to negotiate an exit package, potentially leaving millions of dollars behind.Google, too, should have been an ally. The company invested in Uber in 2013 and, four years later, owned a stake worth billions. But the two companies began to look more like competitors as both raced to build self-driving cars. What might have remained a friendly rivalry soured irrevocably when Uber bought the self-driving trucking startup Otto for more than $600 million in stock. Most of Otto’s core employees were former Googlers, led by their own brash co-founder, Anthony Levandowski. Google co-founder Larry Page had already grown to loathe Kalanick. Now he was fuming.Google filed a lawsuit in late February, accusing Uber of stealing its secrets. Its allegations were devastating, the most damning one being that Levandowski had downloaded 14,000 Google files before he quit to start Otto.The legal fight, expected to go to trial shortly, may have been avoided if Kalanick had listened to his senior executives. Salle Yoo, Uber’s general counsel and typically not someone inclined to challenge her boss, expressed serious reservations about the deal, according to two people familiar with the discussions. Kalanick’s top deputy, business chief Emil Michael, stayed away from the transaction—he didn’t think it made much financial sense and risked a backlash from Google.Meanwhile, private investigators hired to conduct due diligence on Otto before the acquisition closed learned that Levandowski had possessed five disks of data from Google’s driverless effort and other information that included “source code, design files, laser files, engineering documents and software related to Google self-driving cars,” according to the investigators. (Levandowski told investigators he’d destroyed the disks, a claim they said they couldn’t verify. Uber says its self-driving car technology doesn’t borrow from Google’s and that it never possessed Google’s files.)Kalanick, who says he never read the investigators’ report, went forward with the deal anyway. And he agreed to protect Levandowski from legal attacks by Google. Kalanick was placing an enormous bet on someone who liked to play things fast and loose, even by the standards of Silicon Valley’s eccentric engineers.Then, after Google filed its lawsuit, Levandowski told the court he was likely to invoke the Fifth Amendment’s protection against self-incrimination. He would no longer help defend Uber, further imperiling the company’s case. Uber’s top lawyer, Yoo, who was traveling, videoconferenced into a meeting with Kalanick and demanded Uber either put Levandowski on leave or dismiss him. Yoo’s deputy, Angela Padilla, who oversaw the case, agreed. Kalanick insisted that the company stick by Levandowski—that Kalanick’s “brother from another mother,” as he once described Levandowski, would eventually be vindicated.By spring the public outcry against Kalanick was coming in loud and clear on the company’s surveys. On a question asking respondents what they thought of specific business leaders, he ranked dead last among tech CEOs and only slightly above the CEOs of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Wells Fargo & Co. Employee morale was falling along with the CEO’s reputation. “Until 2017, you could go into Uber on any given day and half the T-shirts were Uber T-shirts,” says one executive. “They disappeared overnight. People didn’t want to wear Uber stuff.”Kalanick was unable or unwilling to right himself. If anything, his judgment deteriorated. He decided that he should apologize privately to Kamel, the driver he berated on video. The plan was simple: meet with Kamel at some neutral and nonthreatening location, engage in five minutes of pleasantries, say sorry, and leave.The meeting went on for more than an hour, with Kalanick re-debating Kamel over Uber’s pricing policies. Somehow, by the end, Kalanick suggested that he give the driver Uber stock, according to people familiar with the discussion.Wayne Ting, who ran Uber’s San Francisco business, was in the room with Kalanick and Kamel. In an email later circulated among employees and directors, Ting said he was deeply disturbed by what he saw. He told people he called his own father to seek moral counsel. He worried that paying the driver off with Uber’s own shares was financially irresponsible—would Uber compensate all of its drivers who felt mistreated? To Ting, the incident reeked of a lack of self-control. In the email, he wrote that Kalanick “no longer had the moral standing” to lead Uber. After Uber’s lawyers insisted the company wouldn’t pay Kamel to clean up Kalanick’s personal scandal, Kalanick agreed to pay Kamel $200,000 out of his own pocket, according to a person familiar with the matter. “The meeting ended on a positive note, and Travis appreciated Mr. Kamel’s openness and forgiveness,” a spokesperson for Kalanick said in a statement.In late March, the tech publication the Information published an account of a visit by Kalanick and other Uber executives to a karaoke bar in Seoul in 2014. Kalanick’s then-girlfriend Gabi Holzwarth, who went along on the work trip, told the Information that the bar was staffed by “escorts,” each woman labeled with a number so customers could pick them out more easily. (Holzwarth said she and Kalanick left the bar together after about an hour.)In June, Bloomberg News and the tech blog Recode reported that Eric Alexander, Uber’s president for Asia-Pacific, had obtained and carried around the confidential medical record from a horrific December 2014 rape of a 26-year-old passenger by an Uber driver in Delhi. Alexander, Kalanick, and other executives had discussed among themselves a preposterous theory—that the rape may have been a setup by Ola, Uber’s primary rival in India. Through a spokesperson, Alexander declined to comment.The Asia news—especially the India revelations—resonated as loudly inside Uber as outside. “It was like a bomb went off inside the company,” said one senior exec. After the story was published, many employees stayed home. There was a feeling that the company had gone too far.A short time later, six members of Uber’s ELT, or Executive Leadership Team, sent a confidential letter to the board. The letter, according to a person familiar with the matter, asked for an independent board chairman to be appointed and for accountability at the highest levels of the company. They implored the board to fire Emil Michael, Alexander’s boss at the time as well as Kalanick’s closest deputy, and demanded the board force Kalanick to take at least a three-month leave of absence.Over the years, Kalanick had a simple method for dealing with Bill Gurley, one of his earliest backers and board members. Kalanick told colleagues that all he had to do was ignore Gurley’s phone calls and Gurley would call less often.The silent treatment never seemed to bother Gurley much. A tall, affable Texan and a partner at venture capital firm Benchmark, he often appeared at conferences and on television evangelizing Uber and praising the entrepreneurial abilities of its CEO. In 2016, along with the rest of Uber’s board, he turned over more control to Kalanick as part of a $3.5 billion investment from Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund.As 2017 wore on, Kalanick became even less communicative than normal. He was regularly missing or canceling leadership team meetings and wasn’t delivering on his declaration, made in a public letter, to hire “a Chief Operating Officer: a peer who can partner with me to write the next chapter in our journey.” In March, after years of trying, Gurley finally got himself appointed to the board’s audit committee and learned of the steep losses in Uber’s subprime vehicle-leasing division, which helped its drivers finance cars.Gurley’s cheerleading turned into anxiety and then horror. Benchmark’s stake in Uber was worth billions; could that fall by half? Could it fall to zero? Would they all end up in court? People at Benchmark worried that the Uber situation was affecting Gurley’s health.Gurley and his partners declined to talk about the controversies at Uber and about what they did next. But in conversations with colleagues, relayed to Bloomberg Businessweek, Gurley expressed frustration over Kalanick’s handling of the Google lawsuit and his inexplicable reluctance to fire Levandowski, even though his senior advisers were urging him to do just that. In May, as part of Gurley’s gradual campaign for more influence at Uber, he and David Bonderman, co-founder of private equity firm TPG, drafted a resolution that would empower the board to fire Levandowski. Kalanick finally relented, and Levandowski was dismissed at the end of May.By the time the six executives sent their letter to the board urging that Kalanick take a leave of absence, Gurley was ready to consider it. The directors met on Sunday, June 11, at the Los Angeles offices of Holder’s law firm, Covington & Burling. They reviewed Holder’s report, which detailed not only a sequence of sexual harassment incidents at the company but also a culture of legal noncompliance that systematically equated rule-following with bureaucracy and failure. The board voted to adopt Holder’s 47 recommendations, including rewriting Uber’s absurdly bro-ish cultural values (“toe stepping,” “always be hustlin’\\u2009”), restricting the consumption of alcohol at company events, and instituting an anonymous complaint process for employees.There was no discussion about asking Kalanick to resign, but the board agreed to a temporary sabbatical for the CEO, on his own terms. Kalanick was grieving from a recent family tragedy—his mother, Bonnie, was killed and his father, Donald, seriously injured in a boating accident in Fresno, Calif. After the accident, Kalanick had been saying he would acquiesce to taking time off, as a way to both mourn and try to end the media storm.Two days later, Arianna Huffington, the media entrepreneur and Kalanick’s staunchest ally on the board, led an all-hands meeting at Uber’s Market Street headquarters in San Francisco, announcing the board’s recommendations and Kalanick’s leave of absence. A 16-member committee of senior execs would run the company and institute a round of image-repairing changes, such as adding a long-debated tipping feature to the Uber app and updating the entire driver support operation.Kalanick wasn’t at the all-hands meeting, nor did he come to the office over the following week. But employees and board members never stopped feeling his presence. According to numerous insiders, Kalanick was dialing into conference calls, reviewing internal data, and recruiting candidates to fill the open spots on the executive team. Gurley also heard from several major investors, saying that Uber’s finance team was quietly spreading the word that Kalanick was still in control.Even in top-level conversations where Kalanick appeared to be absent, other executives and board members suspected that Huffington was serving as his proxy. The founder of the Huffington Post was a constant presence at Uber’s offices, making suggestions that seemed to promote her new wellness company, Thrive Global Holdings LLC. For example, she wanted to put “nap pods” at driver hubs and give drivers meditation wristbands. Huffington’s company received $50,000 in consulting fees from Uber. The perceived self-dealing didn’t go over well internally, and she had the money returned, according to a person familiar with the matter. A spokesperson for Huffington says that Thrive provided services at cost, and that Huffington refunded the fees when events required her to take on a more active role at Uber.Founders enjoy an exalted status in Silicon Valley. Apple Inc. once fired Steve Jobs; then he came back and led it to historic greatness. The dismissal of a successful founder has been considered a cardinal sin ever since. Benchmark is very Silicon Valley: You’re either 100 percent behind a CEO or against them. There is no in-between.In a meeting at the firm’s offices in Woodside, Calif., a few days after Kalanick went on leave, Gurley and his partners came to a decision: Kalanick had to go, for good. They quietly reached out to other investors—First Round Capital, Menlo Ventures, Fidelity Investments, and Lowercase Capital—which all called meetings of their respective partnerships. Five signed a letter imploring Kalanick to resign.On June 20, Benchmark dispatched two partners, Matt Cohler and Peter Fenton, to confront Kalanick in Chicago, where he was interviewing Walter Robb, the former co-CEO of Whole Foods Market Inc., for the open COO spot. The venture capitalists surprised Kalanick at the Ritz-Carlton hotel and presented him with a letter, titled “Moving Uber Forward.” It accused him of a number of leadership missteps that put the company in legal peril. It asked for his resignation as CEO and to relinquish the board seats he controlled.Benchmark viewed its letter as an opening gambit. The firm and the other investors represented only about 40 percent of Uber’s voting shares—not enough to force a resignation. But it had other kinds of leverage. Cohler and Fenton told Kalanick he had a few hours before they went public with their allegations. They also said that if he resigned, they would tell the world he had quit on his own terms.Kalanick spent the next few hours in a panic, consulting with Robb and calling allies, lawyers, and investors. In the late afternoon, Huffington called Kalanick and prodded him to step aside. The two agreed that the letter was the first move in a lawsuit for fraud and the likely start of a bitter fight for control that would further damage the company he helped build.Kalanick later told friends that, after “five months of pummeling,” he lacked the energy for another fight. So, to the surprise of the two Benchmark partners and Gurley, who saw little chance that he would acquiesce, Kalanick signed the documents at the Ritz in Chicago.Uber being Uber, nothing went as scripted. The New York Times ran a detailed story about the resignation, infuriating Kalanick. What he believed was going to be a graceful departure now looked like the Benchmark-administered ouster it actually was.Kalanick reneged on his agreement to let go of his board seat and the two others he controlled. He also began calling early Uber employees, asking whether he’d have their support should he call for a shareholder vote. On Aug. 10, Benchmark’s Cohler started contacting his board members from a safari in Africa to alert them: Benchmark was suing Kalanick in Delaware court, accusing him of fraud and of breaching his fiduciary duty. A few days later a group of investors loyal to Kalanick filed an amicus brief in support of him and against Benchmark. (Kalanick has denied Benchmark’s claims. Benchmark has agreed to drop the lawsuit once a deal with SoftBank Group Corp. goes through. Kalanick plans to sell one-third of his stake in the deal.)Although he no longer came into the office, Kalanick managed to keep himself in the middle of the company’s affairs. He lobbied for his own pick as successor, former General Electric Co. chief Jeffrey Immelt. The Uber directors would have none of that—they suspected that Kalanick had secured an agreement from Immelt to serve for only two years, paving the way for his Jobs-like return. Kalanick also flew to Seattle to interview a wild-card candidate referred by investor TPG: Expedia Inc. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, who later marveled to friends that it certainly felt like Kalanick was still in charge.Indeed, Kalanick had some tepid support inside the company. But his vote counting rankled even his defenders. He was also calling executives daily, asking for detailed information about the business. Even worse, he ordered the security team to dig through an employee’s email to see if that person was leaking a potentially damaging story. It all proved too much for the 16-person executive team, which signed a letter to Uber’s board—but clearly directed at Kalanick—asking them to refrain from reaching out to employees or meddling in the company’s daily affairs. Kalanick’s own handpicked executives turned against him.Somehow, amid the dysfunction, Uber hired Khosrowshahi, who impressed the board with a thoughtful PowerPoint presentation that included a slide that read, “There can be only one CEO at a time.” Khosrowshahi was all that Kalanick wasn’t or couldn’t be: humble, a good listener, and a diplomat. In a pointed reversal of Kalanick’s mantra, he would say: “We don’t have a PR problem; we have an ‘us’ problem—we have behaved poorly.” And when the city of London revoked Uber’s operating license in September, Khosrowshahi visited, met with taxi regulators, and published an open letter. “On behalf of everyone at Uber globally, I apologize,” he wrote. “We will appeal this decision on behalf of millions of Londoners, but we do so with the knowledge that we must also change.”It would be Khosrowshahi’s responsibility to find capital infusions (such as the recent investment by a consortium led by SoftBank), cut the company’s burn rate (2017 losses: $4 billion), settle some of its legal problems (lawyer fees over two years: an estimated $500 million), and march toward a 2019initial public offering.Kalanick has privately told people he thought the apology tour was a mistake. But his opinion no longer matters—Uber’s new COO, Barney Harford, says he was hired without ever meeting him. The SoftBank deal will make Kalanick a billionaire. Friends say he’s trying to keep busy. He’s setting up a family office and spending time with his father in Los Angeles. And he’s getting very good at 2048, the single-player smartphone puzzle game.For more on Uber, check out the Decrypted  podcast: '),\n",

       "  'Somewhere between the squabble over whose \"nuclear button\" is bigger, the \"bomb cyclone\" and the fire and fury surrounding a tell-all book on the Trump presidency, this week delivered an important lesson for Wall Street about the messy, fickle times in which we\\'re all living. Investors in 21st Century Fox Inc., Aetna Inc., Time Warner Inc. and their megadealing ilk might want to pay attention. A puny corporate takeover that few people beyond billionaire Jack Ma cared much about was just served a death blow by the Trump administration. The damage is pretty much confined to MoneyGram International Inc. shareholders (more than 20 percent of which are hedge funds). But the deal\\'s undoing speaks volumes about the amplified risk in betting on transactions that are being kicked up to various government regulatory bodies under Trump -- especially high-profile, super-sized ones like Walt Disney Co.\\'s $66 billion offer to buy most of Fox and CVS Health Corp.\\'s $77 billion deal for Aetna.Investors bid up the price of MoneyGram in anticipation of a sale to China\\'s Jack Ma, but suffered big losses as the stock sank 34% amid pushback from the Trump administrationData: Bloomberg; graphic by Bloomberg GadflyWagering on the outcome of mergers has always required a strong stomach, but under previous administrations there were at least some generally accepted guidelines when it came to regulatory matters. For example, reducing an industry from four to three competitors is probably a no-no, and we can\\'t be selling national security assets to, say, China. Ma and his Ant Financial hail from China, but their takeover target, Dallas-based MoneyGram, is just a small money-transfer business popular among working-class immigrants. Even though MoneyGram -- like all financial services -- does possess sensitive user data, it didn\\'t stand out as the type of target that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. would have traditionally preoccupied itself with.So what\\'s changed? For one, cybersecurity has become a hot issue. But it\\'s also hard not to notice how CFIUS\\'s profile has been raised amid Trump\\'s more nationalistic and protectionist views and that China has been a particular sore spot for him -- points I noted last March in cautioning traders lured by the MoneyGram bidding war. It just goes to show that conventional wisdom around M&A no longer holds true for many reasons, geopolitical and otherwise. And Ma\\'s efforts to build goodwill with Trump didn\\'t aid his dealmaking. It hasn\\'t helped AT&T Inc.\\'s Randall Stephenson either. Beyond Trump\\'s unpredictability, it\\'s difficult to untangle what is deserved scrutiny by his staff of regulators and what some believe could be influenced by his own ax-grinding. This has been part of the criticism of the Justice Department\\'s suit to block AT&T\\'s $109 billion takeover of Time Warner, which has plunged 11 percent since early October. While I do feel the transaction warrants a close look given the consolidation of power that may hurt consumers, I can\\'t say I know for sure that that\\'s the government\\'s motive.Time Warner is trading about 14% below its takeover price and almost as if there is no deal, while AT&T\\'s stock -- which makes up part of its offer -- has also been quite volatileData: Bloomberg; graphic by Bloomberg GadflyEither way, AT&T-Time Warner points to another belief that no longer holds true -- that \"vertical\" mergers are O.K. because the number of competitors isn\\'t changing. As media consumption turns more digital, the industry is becoming more complex. The same can be said for health care, where you now have CVS, a giant on the pharmacy side, trying to swallow one of the country\\'s biggest insurers. And yet somehow Amazon.com Inc. was able to scoop up Whole Foods Market without regulators batting an eye.Keep in mind that with transactions as large as these, it\\'s not just merger arbitrageurs and hedge funds who are gambling. These deals are shaping the futures of the companies involved and their respective industries, and what\\'s true for all of them is that they are trying to plug some shortcoming. It shows that these acquisitions are more of a necessity than simply nice to have. So even with the stocks trading at wide spreads to account for some risk that the deals collapse, the downside could still be large and quite painful for both the buyers and sellers. Some analysts say investors are too pessimistic about the Disney-Fox merger and that the spread is too wide. But if it were to fall apart, shares of both companies would likely tumble:Data: Bloomberg; graphic by Bloomberg GadflyTake this as a note of caution.'),\n",

       "  'Walt Disney Co. truly is a magical place. It\\'s managing to buy some $52 billion of assets without technically spending a dime. The how and why make it even more interesting.Last week, the Murdoch family agreed to sell certain of their 21st Century Fox Inc. TV and film businesses to Disney in return for shares in the entertainment conglomerate. No cash is changing hands. In fact, Disney stands out as the only U.S. acquirer this year to not take advantage of cheap borrowing rates -- or rather not need to -- for a deal over $20 billion. Most U.S. acquirers that pursued acquisitions in the $1 billion-or-higher range this year used their own cash or borrowed the money, rather than offering equity:Data: Bloomberg; graphic by Bloomberg Gadfly*Some transactions had investors choose between cash and stock.For the last few years, the M&A market has been punctuated by colossal, highly leveraged mergers, such as AT&T Inc.\\'s pending takeover of Time Warner Inc. and CVS Health Corp.\\'s recent offer for Aetna Inc. Both are made possible by low-cost debt and investors\\' renewed comfort with stretching balance sheets in the name of growth. That Disney -- in the face of ratings pressure and much industry uncertainty -- can still fully rely on its stock for currency for a deal this magnitude is a testament to the faith shareholders have in CEO Bob Iger and his team. To offset the dilution to Disney shareholders, the company does plan to repurchase $10 billion worth of stock \"between now and shortly after the transaction closes,\" plus up to an additional $10 billion within two years post-closing. So in that sense, it\\'s spending some money, but buybacks are the normal course of business at Disney. It spent $9.4 billion on share repurchases in its fiscal year that ended in September. Management also estimates an eventual $2 billion in cost savings from buying the Fox assets. But why not just borrow the money? When rates are as low as they are, cash certainly makes the numbers in big mergers look prettier at first. As it stands now, Disney\\'s total debt is only 1.5 times adjusted trailing 12-month Ebitda, while all its peers carry higher ratios. With the Fox deal and assuming it then buys the rest of Sky, leverage would expand to about 2.9 times. To put that in perspective, CVS cites an adjusted debt-to-Ebitda ratio of 4.6 should its acquisition of health-insurer Aetna get done. Disney\\'s decision to conserve its balance sheet may have as much to do with its brawn as its own insecurities about the future of media. Its sheer scale insulates the company better than its rivals. Still, prime-time cable ratings for viewers ages 18 to 49 are down about 8 percent at Disney this year through November, according to Nielsen. Todd Klein, a partner at Washington-based venture capital firm Revolution, put it best. \"What can kill really good media companies are bad balance sheets,\" said Klein, who specializes in media and technology businesses. \"No one knows how fast cord-cutting will continue to happen, so you don’t want to be stuck with a broken balance sheet when you might need a strong balance sheet the most. And if you have the strength in your share price and the confidence of your shareholder base, there\\'s a lot of sense to this.\"Disney\\'s stock commands a premium valuation relative to all its closest peers, which made it an attractive form of payment for Fox shareholders, including the MurdochsData: Bloomberg; graphic by Bloomberg GadflySeeing the success Netflix Inc. has had in stealing cable subscribers, Iger is taking the plunge into the streaming world. In 2018, Disney will launch two streaming offerings, plus the Fox deal will give it majority ownership of Hulu, which opens a lot of doors. These latest moves by Iger have been by far the riskiest he\\'s made in his tenure -- they\\'re also necessary. Media networks supplied nearly half of Disney\\'s $14.8 billion of operating profit this year.Netflix may have won the battle, but its strategy is dependent on being able to easily access the debt markets. Disney\\'s doesn\\'t, and it\\'s building up its arsenal. '),\n",

       "  'Star Wars fans raise their lightsabers before the start of Star Wars: The Last Jedi in Subang Jaya, Malaysia, on Dec. 15, 2017. America’s movie theaters were jammed in December for the screening of Star Wars: The Last Jedi, a story about the Resistance battling the evil First Order. But with the announcement in December that Walt Disney Co. will acquire much of 21st Century Fox Inc.’s entertainment businesses, theater owners may feel like they’re the Resistance.Disney’s acquisition of Fox’s film studio will unite some of the most lucrative movie franchises, from Disney’s Star Wars and Marvel series to Fox’s X-Men and Avatar. With control of more blockbusters, not only does Disney gain more leverage over theater chains such as AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. and Carmike Cinemas Inc., it also wins more films it could distribute exclusively on its upcoming online service—cutting out cinema operators entirely. “Disney is becoming the Wal-Mart of Hollywood: huge and dominant,” says Barton Crockett, a media analyst at B. Riley FBR. “That’s going to have a big influence up and down the supply chain.”Disney expects the $52.4 billion deal, which includes Fox’s cable channels and international assets, to be completed in 12 to 18 months if regulators approve it. That’s a big if, given that the government recently sued to block the enormous media deal between AT&T Inc. and Time Warner Inc., home of the Warner Bros. studio. Together, Disney and Fox accounted for 40 percent of ticket sales in 2016 in the U.S. and Canada, a level of market concentration that could draw scrutiny from Washington.If the deal goes through, theater owners could get squeezed. Usually a film’s box-office revenue is split evenly between exhibitors and the studio. But Disney previously has gotten theaters to hand over a larger share—sometimes more than 60 percent—on its biggest, most popular films, such as the Star Wars series. Now it could try the same tactic with Fox’s Avatar, which has four sequels in the works. “While the future of movie exhibition looks increasingly dim, a Disney-Fox merger will elevate its level of pain,” says Rich Greenfield, an analyst at BTIG LLC.Cinema chains have already suffered this year from a string of box-office bombs, including Warner Bros.’ King Arthur: Legend of the Sword, and online video services such as Netflix Inc. are keeping more moviegoers at home. Studios also are considering ways to get film releases onto video sooner, putting more pressure on theater owners. All that has led to consolidation in the industry, with Britain’s Cineworld Group Plc agreeing to buy Regal Entertainment Group for $3.6 billion in December.Unlike Fox and other big studios, Disney hasn’t pushed to shorten the time movies are shown in theaters before reaching home video. So shifting Fox’s movie slate to Disney, which prefers long theatrical runs, “could be a positive for theaters,” says Leo Kulp, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets LLC. Yet Disney still presents exhibitors with a big potential worry: its plan to launch an online service in 2019 with Pixar and Marvel flicks. “Disney may push Fox’s films to its direct-to-consumer platform,” Kulp says, “and bypass the theaters altogether.”'),\n",

       "  'Stormtroopers march on the red carpet at the European Premiere of Star Wars: The Last Jedi in London on Dec. 12.PHOTOGRAPHER: GARETH CATTERMOLE/GETTY IMAGESChiara Costantino moved to London from her native Italy four years ago seeking a job as a computer effects artist for films. Today she works at an animation shop called Jellyfish Pictures where she most recently created explosions and the Millennium Falcon’s jumps to light-speed in “Star Wars: The Last Jedi,” the likely blockbuster that opened this week. Even though she’s prospered from the move, Costantino says that after Britain voted to leave the European Union, she wouldn’t recommend that friends follow her. “I don’t tell people to come,” says the 30-year-old with dyed-white hair and a nose-ring. “I can’t assure them it will be the same as when I got here.”While Britain’s movie industry is unquestionably booming, a big part of the prosperity can be attributed to the country’s position as part of the larger European film business—and Brexit could threaten that. It’s not uncommon for cast and crew to quickly shuttle to locations across Europe—parts of “The Last Jedi” were filmed in Ireland and Croatia—a practice that might be undermined by new visa restrictions or bureaucratic processes. And British producers enjoy EU financing to get projects off the ground as well as marketing support for their films on the Continent, benefits that would likely evaporate after Brexit.Rebecca O’Brien, producer of “I, Daniel Blake,” which won the top honor at the Cannes Film Festival last year, says pulling it together without Europe would have been a “nightmare.” Without European backing, “the budget would’ve been severely cut,” she says.U.K. spending on feature film productions has doubled over the last 10 years, to 1.6 billion pounds in 2016, the British Film Institute reports. The Harry Potter and James Bond franchises have long been based out of the U.K., and this year’s hit “Paddington 2” was filmed at locations across Britain. The industry directly employs about 80,000 people, up 40 percent since 2010, and contributes 4.3 billion pounds to the economy, according to the BFI.Foreigners “don’t feel like there’s a future for them here”The biggest concern among producers is staffing. The British Film Institute figures that in the next five years 10,000 skilled people—from make-up artists to carpenters—from outside Britain will be needed to fill new jobs. Brexit will threaten one of the industry’s greatest strengths: the ability to assemble a world-class creative team at short notice, says Phil Dobree, chief executive of Jellyfish, where more than 80 of 200 employees are from continental Europe. Foreigners “don’t feel like there’s a future for them here,” says Dobree, who says hiring has gotten harder since the Brexit vote. “It’s a very, very sad thing for our country.”Like virtually every other British business, the U.K.’s film sector is lobbying the government for access to talent. Ideally, many producers say, Britain would simply avoid imposing any new limits on immigration after breaking ties with the EU, but that seems unlikely given that an end to free movement was a key pledge of the Brexit campaign. The British Screen Advisory Council, a lobbying group for the U.K.’s audio-visual sector, is advocating exemptions for companies deemed strategically important or facing particular skills shortages. Immigration restrictions threaten “our position as a world-class location for filming,” says Pete Johnson, the council’s chief executive. “Those who can help grow sectors of the future are precisely the people we need.” Adrian Wootton, chief executive of the British Film Commission, a government agency that supports international film-making in the U.K, says the industry’s concerns may be overblown. Production in the country will continue to benefit from world-class studios and a deep pool of expertise in everything from finance to set-building to acting, plus a tax scheme that gives producers a 25 percent rebate on money spent making movies in Britain.“We are by quite a long way one of the healthiest sectors in the whole of the U.K. economy,” says Wootton. “Our job is to ensure we keep it that way.”So far, Brexit has provided a financial tailwind, with the depreciation of the pound making it cheaper to shoot in Britain: Inward investment in the British film sector jumped 39 percent to 1.6 billion pounds over the first nine months of 2017, the highest on record, according to the BFI. At Pinewood Studios, a sprawl of warehouses in leafy Buckinghamshire 20 miles west of London, Disney’s live-action remake of Dumbo has just wrapped shooting and work is starting on the next installment of Star Wars, slated to begin filming there next year.The currency boost, though, shouldn’t be a cause for complacency, cautions Neil Hatton, chief executive of the U.K. Screen Alliance. The global film industry is highly competitive and other countries will look to lure work from Britain, he says. And while Brexit talks appear to have broken out of a deadlock, big questions still remain about what happens on exit day in March 2019. “Anyone who builds the success of their industry on the collapse of their own currency is asking for trouble,” Hatton says. “Let’s not rely on that.”'),\n",
       " ('Why New Roadblock for Dealmaking May Be Vertical',\n",
       "  '2017-12-15',\n",
       "  'Game of Media ThronesPHOTOGRAPHER: HELEN SLOAN/HBOFor decades, U.S. antitrust enforcers have worried mostly about mergers between direct competitors that might lead to higher consumer prices. They’ve been less bothered by deals between companies that are in related businesses but don’t compete directly. That could be changing with the Justice Department’s lawsuit to block an $85.4 billion merger between AT&T Inc. and Time Warner Inc., which combines a distribution company with a content provider. The shift in enforcement raises the possibility that similar types of combinations could hit a roadblock, slowing down the pace of dealmaking.Horizontal and vertical. In the horizontal kind, a company buys one of its competitors. Imagine if Toyota Motor Corp. bought General Motors Co., or Apple Inc. acquired Samsung Electronics Co. These are the types of deals that have raised antitrust worries in the past. Vertical deals, on the other hand, unite companies that operate at different levels of production or distribution, as is the case with AT&T and Time Warner. Think of Toyota or Apple buying one of their many parts suppliers. These deals don’t increase concentration in an industry because they don’t combine head-to-head rivals.They potentially give an acquirer market power, depending on the shape of the industry. By taking out a competitor, the buyer may be able to raise prices on its own or in coordination with the remaining players. The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have successfully challenged many of these types of deals. For example, the Justice Department in early 2017 stopped two health-insurance mergers -- Anthem Inc.’s proposed takeover of Cigna Corp. and Aetna Inc.’s deal with Humana Inc.In theory, they can make a company more efficient by giving it cost advantages over rivals. Those lower costs can be passed on to customers in the form of lower prices. Yet vertical deals also can threaten competition by, for example, giving a company the power to raise the operating costs of its rivals. In the Time Warner case, the Justice Department claims AT&T could charge higher rates for, say, Time Warner’s HBO, which produces the \"Game of Thrones\" series. That would push up costs for rival distributors such as Dish Network Corp., which presumably would pass on those higher costs to its customers. The case is set to go to trial on March 19.Enforcers have long recognized that vertical deals can present a host of problems that harm competition. It’s just that they tended to fix them through settlements in which companies agreed to restrictions on how they would conduct business in the future. When Comcast Corp. bought NBCUniversal in 2011 -- a vertical deal that united Comcast’s distribution with NBCUniversal’s content -- Comcast agreed to dozens of conditions. Many had to do with content-licensing to address the government’s view that Comcast would be able to harm online-video rivals like Netflix Inc. or Amazon.com Inc. by raising the cost of NBCUniversal content or withholding it altogether. President Donald Trump’s Justice Department views those kinds of fixes skeptically, a stance welcomed by those who say these conditions don’t work.CVS Health Corp.’s $68 billion bid for Aetna Inc., also a vertical merger, could be next in the Justice Department’s crosshairs. It has the potential to reshape how Americans receive health care by uniting CVS’s pharmacies and drop-in clinics with an insurer. The companies say the deal would make basic care more convenient and less costly, but there’s also the risk that CVS might steer Aetna’s insured members to its pharmacies whether or not they live or work near one. Walt Disney Co.’s $52.4 billion acquisition of many 21st Century Fox Inc. assets is mostly a horizontal combination. But it raises some of the same concerns the Justice Department has with the AT&T-Time Warner deal. By combining its ESPN network with Fox’s 22 regional cable networks devoted to sports, Disney could force distributors to buy bigger bundles of content, for example. That would hurt rivals such as Dish Network’s Sling TV that are only interested in individual channels.Trump’s antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim, has thrown out the playbook for resolving antitrust concerns in vertical deals. Days before suing AT&T and Time Warner, Delrahim criticized the behavioral settlements that enforcers have used to set requirements on how a company operates. Such conditions mean that the government must become a roving regulator to closely monitor a company’s affairs, he said. These settlements are hard to enforce, eventually expire and ultimately aren’t a real fix for competition problems, Delrahim told antitrust lawyers in Washington. He’s testing that view on the AT&T-Time Warner deal: Instead of negotiating a behavioral fix, he’s seeking the sale of Time Warner’s Turner Broadcasting unit or DirecTV, AT&T’s satellite-TV operator.Delrahim’s preference for asset sales over behavioral fixes raises the bar for getting vertical deals approved. But analyzing whether antitrust is entering a new era is made tougher by politics. The Time Warner lawsuit has sparked speculation that the decision to block the deal wasn’t motivated by antitrust concerns but by Trump’s disdain for CNN, part of Time Warner’s Turner Broadcasting unit. No evidence has emerged that Trump interfered in the review, but Delrahim will have to establish a longer track record to quell doubts about his approach to vertical mergers.So far, no. The Justice Department shares antitrust enforcement with the FTC, which hasn’t staked out a new position on vertical deals and behavioral settlements. But in a January merger study, the agency said its past behavioral fixes had successfully maintained competition, a sharp split with Delrahim’s view. The FTC, however, was led by a Democrat when it published the study. Trump’s pick to lead the agency, Joseph Simons, who hasn’t yet been confirmed by the Senate, could take a different approach.'),\n",

Discovery Communications Inc. is also linking up with HGTV's parent Scripps Networks Interactive Inc., as Time Warner Inc. and AT&T Inc. head to court to defend their own pending megamerger.As for the Redstone empire, CBS seems to be just moseying along, while Viacom is only starting to potentially regain its footing, as programming changes at MTV provide a much-needed ratings boost. But even though CBS managed to fly under the M&A radar this year, it's unlikely that the $23 billion TV-network operator comes out of 2018 without a deal of its own -- and not necessarily with Viacom.Here are three logical options:1. The Hollywood route: Lions Gate. The debate over content versus distribution has shifted into one over content versus ad-supported networks. Take Disney: It's making a tremendous bet that having more content is the way to win as its TV networks -- while still the company's profit center -- come under pressure because viewers are switching to cheaper internet-streaming packages (Disney is also launching one of its own). CBS is a network operator. It will have four million subscribers for its CBS All Access and Showtime streaming services by the end of the year, making the company a little less dependent on advertising, but it still doesn't have a major film studio. Buying Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. would solve this, as well as give it a business that's even more highly valued by investors. Disney is combining its own studios with Fox's to gain a more than 30 percent share of this year's domestic box office, while AT&T is trying to get control of Warner Bros., and Viacom is working to rebuild the Paramount studio. Lions Gate, in addition to an almost 9 percent box-office share, also owns the growing Starz premium cable network.2. Going vertical: Verizon. The No. 1 U.S. wireless provider has not-so-secretly thought about a content acquisition along the lines of its rival AT&T's deal for Time Warner. CBS is among those with whom Verizon Communications Inc. CEO Lowell McAdam has said he'd be willing to engage. Plus, it's the one potential deal that's truly financially feasible, as opposed to his musings about a Disney or Comcast Corp. merger. McAdam may not make a move until the judge in the AT&T-Time Warner case decides whether to allow that transaction (the trial begins March 19). The other carriers have also linked up with content/streaming players via partnerships. T-Mobile US Inc. has one with Netflix Inc., while Sprint Corp. struck one with Hulu. Comcast, the owner of NBCUniversal and cable and internet packages, is dabbling in wireless services as well, which shows there may be more value in the long run by putting content and distribution under one roof, especially as more binge watching happens over the internet. Whether this potential mass consolidation of power is good for consumers is another story, and I'm not sure I can picture Les Moonves, CBS's chief, working for Verizon, but stranger things have happened this year. After all, who would've thought Disney would cook up a deal that may give the Murdoch family a big stake?3. Keeping it in the family: Viacom. A year ago, Shari Redstone decided it wouldn't be the right strategic move to put CBS and Viacom back together, and maybe she was right. Starting from scratch with a turnaround of Viacom's networks would have been too much of a distraction for CBS. But now that CEO Bob Bakish has made a small bit of progress, there's hope that Viacom can dig its way out of the ratings and debt doldrums. Perhaps a reunion could be a way for CBS to gain more millennial-driven content and a bigger international footprint (one of the draws of the Disney-Fox deal) -- plus it would provide CBS with a film studio. Viacom is still a fixer-upper, but these are assets CBS knows and at one time shared a home with. It's also gotten very cheap, with Viacom's market value dipping to under $12 billion this year, leaving it with a lower valuation relative to Ebitda than every one of its peers but AMC Networks Inc.Decisions over both companies' futures rest with Redstone, 63, who has taken the place of her ailing, 94-year-old father, Sumner Redstone, following a power struggle that bested any MTV reality-show drama and which continues to play out in the media. As she considers her family's legacy and as cord-cutting and streaming turn the TV industry topsy-turvy, securing a deal for CBS -- the Redstones' crown jewel -- has to be a priority. \"),\n",

       "  'It’s been five years since Walt Disney Co. purchased Lucasfilm from founder George Lucas for $4.1 billion, and as fans await the Dec. 15 release of “Star Wars: The Last Jedi,” one thing is clear: The force is stronger than ever in the 40-year-old Star Wars franchise.

       "  '2017-12-08',\n",
       "  'With the 21st Century Fox Inc. mega-deal just around the corner, it\\'s worth a closer look at what exactly Walt Disney Co. may be gaining. To start, here\\'s a rough list of what assets may go where as part of the transaction, which will reportedly top $60 billion when factoring in debt tied to them:At the heart of the deal is CEO Bob Iger\\'s strategy to better harness Disney\\'s valuable films and bulk up on content in preparation for next year\\'s launch of Disney\\'s own streaming service that will rival Netflix Inc. As a result, the company plans to no longer supply Disney and Pixar films to Netflix. Disney may be a couple of years late to this, but the move makes sense considering how it has dominated the box office for three years -- right now with its \"Beauty and the Beast\" remake, and probably soon with the new \"Star Wars\" film coming Dec. 15. The company raked in $1.8 billion in domestic ticket sales through Dec. 3 on just seven new titles, according to BoxOfficeMojo.com. To put that in perspective, it took Time Warner Inc.\\'s Warner Bros. nearly twice as many films to gross that amount, even though it has the No. 2 title, \"Wonder Woman.\" Fox is way down in eighth place with \"Logan,\" revealing an opportunity for Disney to use its film genius to strengthen Fox\\'s franchises. Hulu, the online streaming service, is another key asset in play. The deal could leave Disney with majority ownership, which makes me wonder what Comcast Corp. does, if anything, with its 30 percent stake in the service. Hulu would probably be better served at this point under a single owner to facilitate faster growth. However, that may only make the over-the-top TV world messier from a consumer standpoint as more companies launch their own products, like Disney\\'s doing.On the TV side, the assets Fox is relinquishing don\\'t quite have the wow factor -- FX, National Geographic, regional sports, etc. But it\\'s important to remember that media networks are the biggest and most important part of the Disney empire, and scale is critical as more cable subscribers cut the cord or switch to online services. Even Disney has been feeling the heat. Fox, when taking into account all its networks, has weathered cord-cutting much better than its closest rivals. That\\'s been used as an argument for how Fox CEO James Murdoch could help Disney should he follow the TV assets there and convert to a Disney executive. But there may also be a simple cause for Fox\\'s sturdier subscriber base -- and it has a catch. Fox\\'s audience, particularly on the news side, skews older, therefore viewers are less likely to be ditch cable packages for internet TV. The question is whether down the road that poses a problem. Even so, Murdoch does have U.S. and international media experience, which is the most critical factor for Disney\\'s board in trying to determine Iger\\'s successor. He\\'s scheduled to retire in July 2019 (although it seems he never wants to ever leave). There\\'s already speculation that Murdoch could be primed to take over from him. There are a some hitches, though, such as an obvious conflict of interest with his father, mogul Rupert Murdoch, and brother Lachlan running a rival media giant, and the phone-hacking and sexual-harassment scandals that occurred under the Murdochs\\' watch at News Corp. and Fox. It\\'s still unclear what becomes of Fox. Does it simply remain a smaller company? Do the Murdochs take it private? Or could they even recombine Fox News with News Corp.? And based on CNBC\\'s reporting, this sounds like it will be a stock transaction, so one might assume the Murdochs are also receiving shares of Disney, which is very interesting. As for Disney, it\\'s gaining businesses that have been undervalued in the Fox conglomerate and quickly becoming a powerful force in online streaming before it even has a streaming service. Anyone hoping this year\\'s rumors were true about Iger running for president in 2020 can forget it. Execution is going to be everything, and with this likely Iger\\'s last big deal for Disney, it needs to be another home run.  '),\n",

       "  'Reza Zarrab.PHOTOGRAPHER: OZAN KOSE/AFP/GETTY IMAGESLooking nervous and somber, the FBI’s star witness entered from the lockup and shuffled across the New York federal courtroom in a beige prison smock. The Turkish-Iranian gold trader took a seat at the witness stand for the hearing on Nov. 29, the second day of testimony in a money laundering and sanctions-evasion case brought by the U.S. government. Asked to state his name, he said he was Reza Zarrab.Not long ago, Zarrab’s life might have fit the description of a James Bond villain’s—he glided around Istanbul with his pop-star wife in Aston Martins and Range Rovers, flew on private planes, and sported around the Aegean with his own jetpack and submarine. He liked to carry a gold-plated pistol and kept an office at Trump Towers Istanbul. That all came to an end in March 2016, when Zarrab was arrested by FBI agents as he arrived in Miami for a vacation at Disney World. Over the next 18 months, Zarrab, 34, was the chief defendant in a prosecution accusing him and others of a conspiracy to launder almost $1 billion through banks in the U.S. to help Iran evade sanctions over its nuclear program.Zarrab hired a team of 16 lawyers from some of the most elite U.S. law firms. After the 2016 presidential election, he enlisted two Donald Trump confidants, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and ex-U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey, who tried to cut a deal for his release, including a prisoner swap. But those efforts failed. Then in September, Zarrab vanished.For weeks, his whereabouts were a mystery. The prison registry said he’d been released. Court papers indicated he was no longer participating in the defense of the case. It wasn’t until he appeared in court on Nov. 29 that the full story surfaced. The FBI had removed him from jail to protect him from threats, keeping him under guard at an undisclosed location. By then, Zarrab had secretly pleaded guilty to all the charges against him and agreed to help the U.S. government. As part of his deal, prosecutors offered him and his family witness protection.Over more than a week on the witness stand, Zarrab spun a stunning tale of corruption and double-dealing that reached the highest levels of the Turkish government, all the way up to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The case has further soured Washington and Ankara’s already strained relationship, revealing how America’s longtime ally may have helped Iran undermine sanctions even as Turkey received millions of dollars in U.S. aid. Nine people have been charged, including Turkey’s former economy minister and past chief executive officer of Halkbank, a major Turkish bank owned by the government. Of them, only one—a senior Halkbank executive named Mehmet Hakan Atilla, Zarrab’s former co-defendant—is on trial. The others have all avoided U.S. arrest.In court, Zarrab laid out how he paid tens of millions of dollars in bribes to Turkish government officials and banking executives to win their assistance—and cover—for the money laundering operation. He dropped a bombshell on his second day of testimony, when he implicated Erdogan as part of the scheme, saying he was told Turkey’s president gave orders that two Turkish banks be included in the plot.The son of a wealthy Iranian steel magnate, Zarrab moved to Turkey as a toddler and started various enterprises in his teens. His main business became money transfers, currency exchange, and gold trading. In 2005, Zarrab became a Turkish citizen. Meanwhile, his father was part of a team assembled by Iran’s newly elected president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, to help work around U.S. sanctions, which had ratcheted up in response to Ahmadinejad’s aggressive pursuit of a nuclear program. Iran claimed the program was for peaceful purposes, but in 2011, the International Atomic Energy Agency said it could not rule out a military intent.That led the U.S., along with the United Nations, to impose even tougher sanctions in 2012 to cut off Iran’s banks from the global financial system and block its access to revenue from oil and gas sales. Iran’s economy fell into recession; inflation spiked into the double digits. Although Iran continued to sell oil, the proceeds began piling up in banks beyond its reach. By 2012, Iran had billions of dollars and euros sitting in banks in Turkey, China, India, Italy, and Japan. As sanctions tightened, Zarrab testified that he’d learned that Iran’s central bank and national oil company were looking for ways to get at their money.According to prosecutors, beginning in 2012, Zarrab devised an intricate scheme to move Iran’s money in Turkey to his own company accounts there and then export it in the form of physical gold to Dubai. From there, it was diverted into the international financial system and used to make payments to entities designated by Iran, sometimes through accounts at banks in New York. He then developed similar schemes to gain access to Iran’s money in other countries, with varying degrees of success. At the peak of his operation, Zarrab claims he was using as many as 15 couriers a day to move more than 1,000 pounds of gold at a time. Later, when a new round of sanctions cut off gold as an option, Zarrab developed a system portraying the flows as humanitarian food shipments—though no food was sent.Zarrab said that over four years, he was able to get almost all of Iran’s billions out of Turkey and more out of India, China, and Italy. He testified that he charged $4 to $5 per $1,000 he moved, generating what he claimed was up to $150 million for himself, some of which, he said, went to bribes and bank fees. Officials at the U.S. Department of the Treasury grew suspicious of some of Zarrab’s transactions and in 2012 and 2014 went to Halkbank in Turkey to warn it against doing Iran’s business.While the scheme worked for the most part, it already had begun to unravel. On a foggy New Year’s Eve in 2012, a plane carrying a Zarrab shipment was unexpectedly forced to land in Istanbul for refueling. Customs officers found more than a ton of undeclared gold in the cargo hold. The subsequent probe produced reams of wiretapped audio recordings, records of text messages, and other materials. Authorities raided the home of Halkbank’s CEO, Suleyman Aslan, and found $4.5 million in cash stuffed into shoe boxes. Turkish police arrested Zarrab in 2013.But Erdogan soon shut the case down, firing and even jailing police officers and prosecutors handling it. Zarrab was freed, and the scheme resumed, though his role as Iran’s banker to the world had by now drawn the attention of the FBI, which began its own probe. By 2015 federal agents had enough evidence to secure a secret grand jury indictment against Zarrab in New York.Prosecutors have cited repeated instances in which Zarrab invoked Erdogan’s name in furtherance of the laundering scheme, including recorded conversations in which he told people he’d laid out the entire plan to Erdogan. In one 2013 conversation, Zarrab said: “Even if we do two billion, that is important. Do you understand? It is important for me, in the eye of the prime minister, since I will go straight to him.” (Erdogan was prime minister from 2003 to 2014.) Prosecutors have cited donations Zarrab directed to charities associated with Erdogan’s family.Despite Zarrab’s efforts, the sanctions had their intended effect. Iran soon came to the negotiating table to discuss modifying its nuclear program. The country struck a deal in July 2015, with the sanctions lifted beginning in January 2016. By then, the course of Zarrab’s odyssey had already been set. On his second day on the witness stand, the Erdogan administration moved to seize his assets in Turkey. And in a speech on Nov. 30, after Zarrab implicated him, Erdogan said: “We have not broken an embargo.”(Updates to provide further clarity on details of Zarrab’s money-transfer activities in Dubai) '),\n",

       "  '2017-12-07',\n",
       "  'David Boies knows what you’re thinking. In the closing weeks of 2017, with nonstop investigations showing how powerful men got away with mistreating women around them for so long, it looks like the fixers, agents, gossip columnists, and attorneys who enabled their behavior will be next in line to fall.But Boies, one of the world’s most powerful attorneys, whose own role has come under fire, is projecting calm and confidence. He and his firm, he says in a phone interview, will be fine. “I do think that many clients’ perspectives are different and more sophisticated than the public narratives,” he says. “They understand what lawyers do.”Boies’s legend as a brilliant courtroom tactician and champion of democratic ideals, which he details in his 2004 memoir, Courting Justice, has grown in step with his big-ticket cases. During the government’s antitrust battle against Microsoft Corp. in the 1990s, Boies tangled with Bill Gates. After the contested 2000 presidential vote, he fought for Al Gore—and then teamed up with George W. Bush’s former attorney to push for gay marriage equality. His admirers have seen Boies as a folk hero who just happens to charge $1,000-plus an hour.That reputation is now being reappraised. Since October dozens of women have alleged that Harvey Weinstein—Boies’s longtime client, business associate, and friend—sexually assaulted or harassed them over the course of decades. (Weinstein, who’s being investigated for sexual assault in New York and London, has denied accusations of nonconsensual sex.) In November the New Yorker reported that, prior to the Weinstein news, Boies signed a contract with a secretive enterprise run by former Israeli intelligence officers to protect Weinstein by trying to stop a New York Times investigation into his history with women. The newspaper—also a Boies client—called his behavior a betrayal of trust and fired his firm, Boies Schiller Flexner LLP. The internet exploded with disgust. “From hero to zero,” wrote Cyd Zeigler, a sportswriter and gay advocate. Rose McGowan, an actor whose allegations helped trigger Weinstein’s downfall, tweeted that Boies was a “scumbag.”For decades, Boies has been cleaning up his wealthy clientele’s messes. More quietly, he’s been cleaning up his own. Interviews with more than a dozen people who’ve worked with him show that this isn’t the first time his loyalty to a friend or client has tested the bounds of propriety and called his judgment into question. “I probably do tend to stay with friends and clients more than some other people would,” he says. “Sometimes that can subject me to criticism.”Boies survived those episodes with his aura intact. Inside the firm’s offices, he and his lieutenants expect nothing different this time around. They’re sure they’ll outlast the current wave of moral outrage—and even imagine themselves on the right side of history. “I’m old enough to remember when nobody ever wanted to defend anybody who was accused of being a communist, whether they were a communist or not,” Boies says. “Today, it’s really dangerous to defend anyone who is accused of being a terrorist, again, whether they are or not. I think that the issue of sexual assault and sexual harassment falls into that category a little bit today. That is not necessarily a bad thing.”Boies’s relationship with Weinstein began over lunch in Manhattan in 2001, a few years after he’d ditched his perch at Wall Street heavyweight Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP to start his own firm. The movie mogul thought Boies’s rise from teen slacker and card shark into omnipotent litigator and fervent craps player would make a great memoir for Miramax Books, Weinstein’s publishing imprint. Boies agreed, and while working on Courting Justice, he began representing Weinstein and his brother, Bob. In 2005, Boies navigated their exit from Walt Disney Co., then provided counsel after they formed Weinstein Co.Weinstein and Boies were seen together on Manhattan’s fundraising circuit. They co-hosted a private screening of Michael Moore’s Fahrenheit 9/11 at the Ziegfeld Theater. Boies and Weinstein couldn’t be a more incongruous pair: The lawyer is lanky and cerebral, the producer paunchy and volcanic. Boies, born in Sycamore, Ill., looks like a disheveled professor. Weinstein, from Queens, N.Y., comes across as a bull shark.In 2012, Boies started a movie company. It was an unusual move for a power lawyer, but his daughter, Mary Regency, was interested in acting and filmmaking; she landed one of her first major acting credits in Weinstein Co.’s Silver Linings Playbook that year. Boies partner Jonathan Schiller’s son Zack was also building up a résumé in entertainment, and Boies partnered with him to run the Boies/Schiller Film Group. They took a shot on a Western called Jane Got a Gun. Boies was executive producing, and his daughter produced. The Weinsteins acquired the U.S. rights with Relativity Media LLC, but things weren’t going well: The director walked away on the first day of production, Jude Law dropped out, Relativity filed for bankruptcy, and the movie went on hiatus.Weinstein Co. was facing a crisis of its own. In 2015, Ambra Battilana Gutierrez, an Italian model, told police in New York that Weinstein fondled her during a work meeting. No charges were filed. However, the police investigation and media coverage came at a tricky moment for Weinstein. That same year, his contract as co-chairman was up for renewal. Two board members, Lance Maerov and Tarak Ben Ammar, wanted to look more closely into Weinstein’s behavior.There was no reckoning—Boies won Weinstein his extension. He was fired only after the October exposé by the Times, at which point Maerov publicly blamed Boies for the company’s failure to deal with Weinstein’s alleged abusiveness. “The lawyers shielded him,” Maerov told the Financial Times. “They shielded him from the indignity of being asked questions by the board.” Boies responded that the directors were trying to “rewrite history.” (Maerov declined to comment for this story. Ben Ammar didn’t respond to interview requests.)Around the time that Boies was trying to extend Weinstein’s contract, the producer was working to get Jane Got a Gun into theaters. In January 2016, Weinstein Co. distributed the movie in the U.S. “Bob and Harvey were all very helpful,” Boies told Newsday when it premiered last year. “I think it was partly due to the fact of my relationship with them.” The Western flopped, but the men stayed in business together. Boies invested $5 million in Gold, a 2016 Weinstein Co. adventure flick starring Matthew McConaughey, and another $5 million in The Upside, a Nicole Kidman comedy slated for next year.In early November, Boies announced in a memo to colleagues that he no longer represented Weinstein. Diane Karpman, a legal ethics expert in Los Angeles, told Bloomberg that Boies could have avoided some of the backlash if he’d dropped Weinstein earlier. “Lawyers are duty bound to believe people like Harvey Weinstein, but at some point common sense does tip the scale,” she said. If Boies had dropped Weinstein in 2015, however, he would have lost a major connection to Hollywood and an opportunity to make millions of dollars. Even though Boies won’t comment on Weinstein, he says there’s a part of his personality that enjoys making calculated bets: “Sometimes if you’re not prepared to risk greatly, you can’t accomplish greatly.”Weinstein isn’t the only power player in the Boies orbit who became a client and friend. Boies appeared on Charlie Rose’s show for the first time in 1999, and the two shared an apartment together in Paris, according to Karen Donovan’s 2005 book v. Goliath: The Trials of David Boies. A few years later, when Radar named Rose a “toxic bachelor,” reporting a woman’s claim that he groped her, Boies sent a letter demanding a retraction. The magazine declined. Last month, a Washington Post investigation revealed Rose’s alleged history of sexual harassment. (He declined to comment for this story.)At Cravath, Boies represented pro bono a Florida woman named Amy Habie, who was in a vicious custody battle with a Guatemalan textile baron. Boies’s family also had a stake in a landscaping business Habie acquired in Palm Beach. The relationship puzzled the firm’s lawyers. “We represent plenty of people pro bono—in discrimination cases and death penalty cases, for example—but wives of Guatemalan tycoons are not exactly what we have in mind,” Samuel Butler, Cravath’s presiding partner, told the Wall Street Journal in 1997. (Butler hung up the phone when reached for comment.)After Boies started his own firm, Habie became chief financial officer. A fight between her lawn-care company and its previous owner had more plot twists and florid characters than a John Grisham thriller. Before it was over, a judge fined Habie for violating court orders and gave her 90 days in county jail. The sanctions were suspended. She remains at Boies Schiller Flexner and says the firm approved work done on her behalf.One of the names that came up in that case was William Duker, who worked under Boies at Cravath before starting his own firm around 1986. A decade later, he admitted to inflating legal bills by $1.4 million. After leaving prison, he became an entrepreneur and played a role in the sale of Habie’s company. “David has never shied away from people that he’s known who have had difficult times,” Duker says. “He’s incredibly loyal.” Duker adds: “There are lawyers who represent ax murderers out there. It doesn’t make them an ax murderer. It makes them what they are—which is a lawyer.”One of Duker’s companies was a document management business called Amici LLC in Albany, N.Y., that served law firms. For a time, Boies Schiller Flexner had clients use Amici without disclosing that several of Boies’s family members, as well as relatives of his firm’s general counsel, Nick Gravante Jr., owned indirect stakes in the company. When Boies Schiller Flexner’s ties to Amici were revealed in court during a client’s bankruptcy case, it touched off a stir. That client, Adelphia Communications Corp., asked the law firm to resign as its counsel. Amid the bad press, Boies told the Wall Street Journal that he should have disclosed the ties, though Gravante says the episode was overblown and that fees were reasonable. The saga ended well for Amici. In 2006, Xerox Corp. announced it was acquiring the company for $174 million.After the New Yorker exposé on Weinstein’s clandestine efforts to undermine potential accusers, Boies responded to the cascading criticism. “I would never knowingly participate in an effort to intimidate or silence women,” he wrote in the same memo announcing that he was no longer representing Weinstein. “That is not who I am.”When Avery Gilbert read that statement, she was beside herself. Gilbert had been an attorney at Boies Schiller Flexner, and before leaving in 2010, she’d believed the firm had stifled her complaints to management about a document management vendor called Boalt Discovery Inc. While working on a multibillion-dollar private equity lawsuit, she’d become suspicious about Boalt. Not only did she think its work was bad and expensive, she suspected that Gravante had a family connection to the business. She complained and was later fired. Reading Boies’s assurance to colleagues about his character, she was so infuriated that she emailed him asking to talk. She wanted an apology but didn’t get one. (This account is from an interview with Gilbert’s husband, Zachary Bendiner, who worked at the firm as a paralegal; he says she signed a nondisclosure agreement and he didn’t.) Boies Schiller Flexner colleagues say neither Gravante nor his family had an interest in Boalt and that Gilbert was let go for other reasons, which the firm declines to discuss.In 2002, Rachel Baird, a former Boies Schiller Flexner attorney, along with a colleague, sued the firm for gender discrimination. In one incident, Baird describes Boies telling her, the only female attorney in the room, to go downstairs and pay for his cab. At the time, the firm said the claims were without merit; eventually, the women settled for $37,500 each.Marguerite Hogan, an associate who left the same year as Gilbert, says: “There weren’t a lot of women for me to look up to. When you’re in that situation and there is nobody else around you that’s like you, it can feel a little isolating.” Today, lawyers at the firm say it has no shortage of female talent and takes on cases aimed at the public good. In February, Boies filed suit against Backpage.com, a web platform for classified ads, which he says profited from child sex trafficking. (Backpage declined to comment.) “I talk about him having a beautiful mind and a beautiful heart,” says Sigrid McCawley, a Boies Schiller Flexner partner in Fort Lauderdale. “I’ve seen it throughout my career.”There have been awkward moments, though. Every year, Boies takes his troops on a winter retreat. Three attendees recall that around 2005, during a weekend in Jamaica’s Montego Bay, lawyers were greeted at an evening reception by a woman splayed out on a buffet table with her body covered in chocolate. Boies’s wife, Mary, a lawyer who works at the firm with one of his two ex-wives, wasn’t amused. “Mary right away directed that the woman get off the table,” says Gravante, the general counsel, who blames the hotel. “But it’s hardly indicative,” he adds. “It’s Jamaica.”This year the retreat will be on a barrier island in Florida. Gravante is confident about the firm’s prospects and mildly annoyed that anyone would suggest trouble ahead. He puts the chances of a major client leaving the firm or refusing it business because of the Weinstein allegations at “zero percent.”Jonathan Hughes, an adviser to DraftKings Inc., says the Weinstein allegations won’t stop the fantasy sports site from working with Boies Schiller Flexner. Even if “the firm and David are suffering a little bit,” he says, “there’s a breadth and a depth to the firm that is fabulous.” Gravante also won’t suffer questions about Boies resigning. “Stepping down? No. Why? No. Why would he step down?” he says. “People recognize that we are still, in my view, the best litigation firm in this country.”It could also be one of the most scrutinized. When novelist Emma Cline and an ex-boyfriend named Chaz Reetz-Laiolo sued one another in November, news coverage focused on the work Boies and his firm have done on the ex’s behalf, including delving into her sexual history.Like guard dog Hollywood attorney Martin Singer or big-time comedy agent Dave Becky, the former manager for Louis C.K., Boies is going to have to adjust to a harsher spotlight. Even as it grows stronger, he seems certain that any examination will show his firm’s work remains a force for good. “You’ve got to have a belief that what you do as part of the justice system, in terms of representing clients, has an overall value to society that is independent of who the particular client is,” he says.Things were different not so long ago. Inside the Wynn Las Vegas last year, Boies was throwing a bash for his 75th birthday, and his pals were lapping up the lawyer’s largesse. Tom Brokaw gave a gushing toast, according to an attendee; Rose and Theranos Inc. founder Elizabeth Holmes mingled, and Weinstein was on the invite list. Ray Kelly, New York’s former top cop, rapped a tribute.As the weekend wound down, Duker, the disbarred lawyer, spoke. In his toast to Boies, he said: “He is able to read minds.

       " ('‘Rampant’ Video Piracy Sparks Calls for a Singapore Crackdown',\n",
       "  '2017-12-03',\n",
       "  'Singapore, which prides itself on being a haven for law and order, is being called a haven for pirating copyrighted programming by entertainment titans such as Walt Disney, HBO, the National Basketball Association and the English Premier League.Viewers in the city-state buy legitimate set-top boxes that also allow unauthorized streaming of thousands of movies, TV shows and live sporting events, said the Coalition Against Piracy. Its 21 members, including divisions of Sony Corp. and Twenty-First Century Fox Inc., want the government to block the pirating software inside the devices, which are found at local electronics stores and on e-commerce sites such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s Lazada.“Within the Asia-Pacific region, Singapore is the worst in terms of availability of illicit streaming devices,” said Neil Gane, general manager of the Asia-focused coalition, referring to countries where the boxes are considered legal. “They have access to hundreds of illicit broadcasts of channels and video-on-demand content.”Singapore, notorious for imposing the death penalty for some drug and firearm offenses, is a focal point in the entertainment industry’s campaign to curb piracy in the region. Online TV and movie piracy will cost the industry an estimated $31.8 billion in global revenue this year, reaching $51.6 billion by 2022, according to London-based Digital TV Research.The Asia-Pacific region will become the largest for online piracy next year, overtaking North America, the researcher said.Singapore ranked ninth in the number of visits per internet user to piracy websites, according to London-based Muso TNT, which tracks such visits. In a separate survey of 1,000 Singaporeans sponsored by industry association CASBAA, about 40 percent said they were active consumers of pirated content.“The piracy here is rampant and shockingly so,” said Lise-Anne Stott, Singapore-based head of legal for A+E Networks Asia, a coalition member that offers History, Lifetime and three other channels there.The boxes allow Singaporeans to use apps that access programming not shown at home because it’s censored, lacks a licensing deal or requires a subscription fee users don’t want to pay. In some cases, users can stream uncensored versions -- with nudity or violence -- of locally available shows such as A+E’s “Vikings.”“Copyright infringement is not so much about a device or technology as it is about whether that device or technology is used in a manner that is illegal,” the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore said in an email. “Users of such devices should therefore ensure that they are accessing content from authorized content providers.”Some of the devices scraping the internet for unauthorized content come from Chinese vendors such as Unblock and EVPad. The square gadgets can be bought either with the streaming apps already installed for plug-and-pirate use or with embedded links for downloading those apps.Tutorials to set them up are found on YouTube and Baidu Inc.’s online forum.The Singapore government said it didn’t consider the devices themselves to be illegal. The boxes also can view legally available websites such as YouTube.At Sim Lim Square, an electronics market a short drive from the president’s official residence, at least 15 retailers sell the set-top boxes for as little as S$100 ($74). Many storefronts advertise that these boxes can stream content otherwise unavailable in Singapore.Ken Lee, a salesman, said his store sells 10 to 20 boxes on a typical weekend. During major electronics fairs, sales can reach 300 a day, he said.Lee said he tells buyers there’s nothing unlawful about using the devices. Since the boxes aren’t downloading copies of programs, they aren’t violating copyright laws, he said.Unblocktech didn’t respond to requests for comment. EVPad said in an email that customers decide which apps to download, and it cannot be held responsible.The industry’s efforts include lobbying the Singapore government to eliminate any confusion about legal uses of the devices and to make it easier to take legal action against companies offering pirated content, said John Medeiros, Hong Kong-based chief policy officer for CASBAA, the coalition’s parent organization.“We continue to engage with the industry on their concerns in relation to the popularity of devices that connect televisions to access online content,” Singapore’s Intellectual Property Office said.The coalition also wants Singapore to block streams of illegal content from entering the country. Last year, the country blocked one website for offering illegal downloads.Minister for Home Affairs and Law K. Shanmugam said in August that Singapore has “a strong intellectual-property regime which protects innovations comprehensively and effectively.’’ The next month, the World Economic Forum ranked Singapore fourth out of 137 countries for protecting intellectual-property rights.Coalition members Sony Pictures Television Networks Asia and Viacom International Media Networks declined to comment. Walt Disney Co. and HBO Asia didn’t respond to requests for comment.“This new coalition adds to our efforts to protect the legitimate rights and interests of the NBA and our partners,” said Ayala Deutsch, executive vice president and deputy general counsel for the league, which earns $2.6 billion annually in broadcast rights from U.S.-based networks alone.The English Premier League, which generates at least 1 billion pounds ($1.3 billion) a year from international media rights, is “currently investigating” suppliers of pirated content in Asia after helping Thai authorities break up an illegal streaming operation there. Games are available in Singapore with a subscription.“The Premier League is currently engaged in its most comprehensive global anti-piracy program,” it said. “This includes supporting our broadcast partners in Southeast Asia with their efforts to prevent the sale of illicit streaming devices.”— With assistance by Bruce Einhorn, Krystal Chia, Yuan Gao, David Hellier, Keith Zhai, and Scott Soshnick'),\n",

       "  '2017-11-20',\n",
       "  \"The buying and selling of technology companies has mostly been a deadly dull business this year. Zzzzz. But one corner of technology dealmaking has been busier than a rush-hour freeway. Companies outside the technology sector are gorging on tech companies. Non-tech acquirers bought $16.1 billion worth of technology companies in the third quarter of this year, according to PwC. That was biggest quarter of tech dealmaking by traditional companies in the three years that comparable data are available.The technology acquisitions by old-school companies included Office Depot Inc.'s $940 million purchase of CompuCom Systems, which sells and manages technology services for companies, and Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s decision to drop about $500 million combined to buy four e-commerce companies and a startup that specializes in delivering purchases made online. Appliance company Whirlpool Corp. also bought a personalized recipe company, Yummly.com; and just last week, Williams-Sonoma Inc. announced it was buying a 3D imaging startup. It's not entirely new for non-technology companies to shop for digital takeovers, but this recent sustained trend is hard to ignore.The motivations for acquisitions still include the desire to consolidate an industry to slash costs, or to have more pricing power over customers or suppliers. But it's also true that all companies are understandably obsessed with keeping up with the times, or at least convincing their investors that they're keeping up with the times. So they are breaking out their checkbooks for technology takeovers that they hope will speed their digital revolution. Yes, everyone is a technology company now, or wants to be. It's also true that it can be hard to predict, especially by companies from outside the tech industry, when it's smart to make a technology acquisition. Anecdotally, nondigital technology companies haven't been the smartest technology dealmakers. Walt Disney Co., for example, has struggled with Maker Studios, the online video company it bought for nearly $700 million in 2014. The parent of Saks Fifth Avenue was forced to write down the value of its acquisition of e-commerce company Gilt Groupe. And General Electric Co. has dialed back its digital ambitions because of a cash crunch and earnings disappointments at other parts of the company.Of course, even technology companies aren't necessarily good at assessing the quality of technology companies they're trying to buy. And for sure, the investment bankers who officiate corporate mergers are glad for the flurry of tech deals by nondigital companies. Otherwise, technology acquisitions are a wasteland.Through Friday, the dollar value of purchased U.S. technology companies stood at about $72.5 billion -- about a third of the value of tech acquisitions in 2016. (There's a late entrant in the 2017 takeover game, but computer-chip maker Broadcom's $100 billion-plus bid for Qualcomm may not happen this year, or ever.) In all, global mergers and acquisitions have been relatively on par with the dollar value of corporate takeovers in 2016, which makes the falloff in tech dealmaking all the more surprising. Traditional companies are in a particularly tough bind when they hunt for technology deals. They have to thread the needle between buying a company with proven technology but not so proven that it's out of the price range of a company with a non-tech valuation multiple. And the most alluring assets are most likely too rich for the likes of Monsanto or General Motors.The rub for traditional companies is it's dangerous to do bad digital deals to try to future-proof themselves, but it's also dangerous not to do anything to stay relevant. So expect the old-school companies to keep shopping in the technology aisle. \"),\n",

       "  '2017-01-03',\n",
       "  'ILLUSTRATION BY SIMON ABRANOWICZWhat does the creator of Star Wars have to do to get a little gratitude?“I’ve been ready to retire for a few years,” George Lucas said. “The idea of going out and doing another Star Wars is something I’m not that crazy about. You know, it’s very consuming.” It was January 2013, and the creator of one of the highest-grossing movie franchises of all time was talking to this magazine about his decision to sell his company, Lucasfilm, to Walt Disney for $4 billion.Lucas, who was then 68, said he was tired of critics and fans who believed he’d mishandled the Star Wars saga over the years—especially a second trilogy, known as “the prequels,” which were scorned for lacking charm and thrills. “I’ll be kind of happy to leave a lot of that criticism and personal attacks behind,” he said. “I didn’t sign up to be a politician.” He vowed to spend his final years puttering around with his camera, making experimental films that might never appear in theaters or expose him to the barbs of cineastes who think his last good movie came out in 1983.Lucas has long been vexed by popularity: It’s the source of his riches, but also the thing that, he says, prompts elites to dismiss his work. It’s also an amplifier for discontent when crowds and critics complain that he has no taste. And yet in retirement, he’s mounted a legacy project that’s grand even by the standards of someone who thinks on a galactic scale. He wants to construct a Lucas museum to house and display his art collection—much of it proudly lowbrow, such as works by the sentimentalist Norman Rockwell; original Flash Gordon comic book art; Mad magazine covers; and memorabilia from his own Star Wars films. According to an early plan for the museum, his trove of Star Wars material includes 500,000 artifacts from the prequels alone. Lucas refers to such works as “narrative art,” the kind that “tells a story.” He believes they’ve been unfairly ignored by snooty critics and curators, and he wants his museum to rectify that.Lucas has offered to build his museum in a major American city for free. Including construction costs, an endowment, and the value of the artwork, his organization says the total value of his gift is $1.5 billion. “It’s an epic act of generosity and altruism,” says Don Bacigalupi, the museum effort’s president. “George Lucas, as with any person of great resources and great success, could choose to do whatever he wants to do with his resources, and he has chosen to give an extraordinary gift to the people of a city and the world.”But so far, Lucas hasn’t found a permanent home for his museum. The monumental project has brought him almost as much grief as Jar Jar Binks, the prequel creature from the planet Naboo with an oddly Jamaican accent that some found racially offensive. Lucas tried to build in San Francisco’s Presidio, which is a national park, and then on Chicago’s downtown waterfront, only to abandon both sites after being assailed by local forces. Some people derided his architecture. Others knocked the artwork. Lucas seemed to find most irritating those who said they didn’t mind his proposal but thought he needed to be more flexible about where he put his building. He had long suffered highfalutin critics as a nuisance when he was selling tickets to movies. Now they were thwarting his will when he was trying to give something away.In Round 3, Lucas is pitting San Francisco and Los Angeles against each other as potential host sites. “Call it hedging your bets, call it beefing up your odds, call it the architectural equivalent of quite publicly asking two people to prom on the same day: Lucas’s dual-track proposal is an unconventional strategy by any measure,” wrote Los Angeles Times architecture critic Christopher Hawthorne.The parallels between Lucas’s career as a filmmaker and his sideline as a curator are striking. With his movies, he never basked in the critical adoration enjoyed by his friends Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese, and Steven Spielberg. “I don’t really have a lot of awards,” Lucas said in a December 2015 interview with Charlie Rose, sounding glum. “I have an Irving Thalberg Award, and I get a lot of little awards. I’ve got two Emmys. But I’ve never had an Academy Award. I’ve been nominated, but I’ve never won. I’m too popular for that.” He pronounced the word as a pejorative, as if he’d been wronged. In the same interview, he called Disney “white slavers” for taking his Star Wars characters and doing whatever it pleased with them. He later apologized. (Disney must be doing something right: Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, the company’s second Star Wars movie, made $290 million globally in five days when it was released in mid-December.)Lucas has expressed similar bitterness in public about his difficulties in getting a city to say yes to his museum. He declined to comment for this story, but Bacigalupi defends his employer. “I find it sad that we live in such a society that can’t receive a gift in the way that it’s intended,” he says, “and instead throws up roadblocks and misunderstandings and sometimes willful misrepresentations to what a museum can be and what a gift really is.”Crissy Field is a grassy area on San Francisco Bay in the Presidio—a former army base transformed by the government into a national park 23 years ago. On a Tuesday afternoon in early November, it’s filled with bikers, joggers, and hikers enjoying the view of the Golden Gate Bridge, considered one of the city’s finest. “This is just a fabulous place,” says Nancy Bechtle, an energetic 79-year-old with short brown hair, wearing a gray fleece, black tights, and sneakers. “You can see why it’s so beloved by people in San Francisco.” In 2008, President George W. Bush appointed Bechtle to the board of directors of the Presidio Trust, the agency that manages the park, and she soon became chairwoman. “I lost more sleep over George Lucas,” Bechtle says, “than I did over my teenage children.”Lucas has a long history at the Presidio. In 2005 he constructed the headquarters of Lucasfilm on the site of an old Army hospital in the park. Five years later he approached the trust with an ambitious proposal to build a digital-arts museum on Crissy Field. “I wanted to build an iconic building like the Sydney Opera House or the Eiffel Tower or the Bilbao museum,” he told Rose in a 2014 interview at Chicago Ideas Week. “I wanted to get five of the top architects and have a contest and pick the best one.”Bechtle liked the idea of a cultural center on the site. But she and the Presidio Trust board wanted something that would blend in and preserve views of the bridge. They also wanted to conduct an open competition for the site—it couldn’t just be Lucas’s for the taking. “If it’s your land, you can do pretty much what you want,” Bechtle says. “But with public land, there is just a higher level of scrutiny.” The trust developed design guidelines for the site. The building could be no higher than 45 feet; as for looks, the trust didn’t want a building that replicated an old-fashioned architectural style.In March 2013 the trust announced it had received 16 submissions—including Lucas’s proposal for a Lucas Cultural Arts Museum chronicling the evolution of visual storytelling from primitive art to Renaissance painting to Rockwell to Star Wars. Bechtle thought it sounded rather nice. “I have a couple of grandsons who are very artistic,” she says. “I thought it would be just right up their alley to go and learn about makeup and design and costumes. They would have loved that.”But Lucas’s proposal topped out at 69 feet. “It was a big, hulking building,” Bechtle says. It also had a Beaux Arts design—not exactly contemporary. John King, the San Francisco Chronicle’s urban design critic, says, “It was like Lucas just came in and said, ‘I’ve got this great thing. You should bend the rules and let me build it, because I’m going to pay for it, and I’m George Lucas.’ That’s how it came off to a lot of people.” King also doesn’t think much of the design. “It just looked like a generic Spanish-themed shopping center,” he says.Rather than compromise, Lucas embarked on a PR campaign. The trust was inundated with letters of praise from such moviemaking colleagues as Coppola, Scorsese, and Jeffrey Katzenberg. A frequent donor to the Democratic Party, Lucas enlisted some of its local leaders, such as California Governor Jerry Brown, San Francisco Mayor Edwin Lee, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, and Senator Dianne Feinstein, to chime in. Feinstein argued that the museum’s height made sense in the era of rising sea levels.Lucas showed off his Rockwells in an exclusive segment on CBS This Morning to correspondent Bill Whitaker, who visited the filmmaker at his 5,000-acre Skywalker Ranch in Marin County, Calif. “Contemporary artists would say this is sentimental, this is schmaltz,” Whitaker said.“Well, in the end, you either look at the world through cynical eyes or idealistic eyes,” Lucas replied.In an interview with the Chronicle, he said he belonged to an esteemed line of creators. “As a popular artist, I hit the same chord with people that Rockwell hit, that Michelangelo hit, that the people who painted on caves in France hit,” he said. “I relate to art more as an emotional experience than as an intellectual experience.”Lucas seemed serene in these interviews, but he was growing impatient. The Presidio Trust declined to discuss its negotiations with Lucas in detail but provided Bloomberg Businessweek with three boxes of e-mail printouts and internal documents in response to a Freedom of Information Act request. The correspondence reveals that the Lucas team refused to supply details about the art that would be shown, saying it was “private” information. Lucas’s plans mentioned using technology in the museum’s educational component. The trust asked what kind. The Lucas group said the information was proprietary.Even so, Lucas made the cut when the trust narrowed the contestants down to three finalists, and it looked like the competition was his to lose if only he would bend. Nevertheless, in September 2013 his impatience boiled over in an interview with the New York Times. He accused the trust of purposely stalling in hopes of killing his museum. “They hate us,” he said, singling out Bechtle for making an issue of his Beaux Arts design. Lucas, who’d recently married Mellody Hobson, a glamorous Chicago mutual fund manager, said he was considering taking his museum to his wife’s city, where Mayor Rahm Emanuel was eager to have it.Three days later, Lucas FedExed Bechtle a contrite letter. “I’m afraid my frustrations got the best of me,” he wrote.“Is there an apology in there?” a board member asked Bechtle in an e-mail.“Yes, I think so,” Bechtle said. “Oblique, but maybe the best he can do.”Bechtle and the board didn’t want to lose the cultural center. They offered Lucas a site near his company’s old headquarters, with a lesser view of the bridge. His board members informed Bechtle that Lucas thought the site wasn’t important enough. “He’s bitter and he’s angry,” Bechtle wrote her colleagues. In February 2014 the trust canceled the competition.In Chicago, Emanuel was doing all he could to woo Lucas. He convened a site selection committee that considered more than 50 locations, and in May 2014 they chose a 17-acre plot occupied by two parking lots just south of Soldier Field, home to the Chicago Bears. It was close to other museums, and to hear the committee tell it, the Lucas building would have views comparable to those in the Presidio: “Framed by the cityscape on one side and an awe-inspiring expanse of water and shoreline on the other, the Museum would be positioned amid the ideal combination of physical and natural beauty.”Lucas happily accepted. The same day, Emanuel held a hastily convened news conference in Chicago City Hall. “I just got off the phone with George Lucas and Mellody Hobson to thank them for choosing Chicago, the most American of American cities,” he said. A reporter asked what the mayor was going to do about the Bears fans who used the parking area to tailgate. Don’t worry, Emanuel responded—he had it all figured out.In October 2014 a triumphant Lucas strode onstage in his usual jeans and plaid shirt to speak to Rose—his preferred interlocutor—before an appreciative crowd at the Chicago Ideas Week conference. He’d been spending a lot of time talking to architects, engineers, and politicians about his endeavor. “It’s a very big, expensive museum,” Lucas said.“Who’s going to pay for this thing?” Rose asked.“I’m paying for the whole thing, and the endowment, and everything,” Lucas responded.“OK,” Rose said. “You can afford a museum?”“Yeah, I can.”“Oh\\u2009…\\u2009my\\u2009…\\u2009God,” Rose said, laughing and amazed, as the crowd applauded.Lucas changed the name of his project to the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art. The museum’s website took on a more scholarly tone, quoting French semiotician Roland Barthes and 15th century humanist Leon Battista Alberti. And in November 2014, Lucas unveiled a design for the museum by architect Ma Yansong.Some thought it looked like a giant amoeba. Others saw a resemblance to Jabba the Hutt. Blair Kamin, the Chicago Tribune’s Pulitzer Prize-winning architecture critic, called it an unappetizing example of “blob architecture” and warned that it was too massive for the setting. “This is the Temple of George,” Kamin wrote, “a monument to its patron rather than a modest addition to a democratic public space.”Lucas courted directors of other Chicago museums. “It was exciting to hear his vision about the importance of narrative art in the world, in human history,” says Gary Johnson, president of the Chicago History Museum. “I found that very, very compelling.” But aside from his appearance at the Ideas Week festival, Lucas kept a low public profile, frustrating the Emanuel administration, which wanted him to help sell his museum—perhaps by exhibiting some of his art so Chicagoans would have a better idea of what would be on its walls.That left Emanuel, who declined several interview requests, as the museum’s primary champion. His approval ratings were falling, and in a runoff election in 2015 he was savaged by his opponent, who called Emanuel “the mayor for the 1 Percent” and assailed him for promoting “a monument to Darth Vader” on the waterfront, when other areas of the city were more in need of development. After Emanuel won reelection, he still had to contend with Friends of the Parks, a citizens’ group that wanted to halt the museum’s construction. Its executive director, Juanita Irizarry, argued that the lakefront site was “public trust land” and the city had no right to turn it over to Lucas. “Our lakefront is our jewel,” she says. “If we say yes to this, who says Oprah doesn’t come back to town and want to put a museum on the lakefront? We all love Oprah. But should that be OK?”Friends of the Parks filed a federal lawsuit. Illinois’ legislature was at the time weighing a bill to allow President Obama to build his presidential library on Chicago’s South Side, and it obligingly added language authorizing the city to lease such land to museums. The bill became law, and in October 2015 the city and the Lucas museum signed a 99-year lease in exchange for $10.Nevertheless, the Friends of the Parks lawsuit progressed, and Lucas again got restless. He started to flirt with other mayors. “We immediately got into contact,” says Los Angeles’s Eric Garcetti. Lucas was also approached by other cities, including Oakland, Calif.; Youngstown, Ohio; and Waukegan, Ill.In Chicago, Emanuel made one last push. Supporters of the museum picketed outside the offices of Friends of the Parks, carrying signs that depicted Irizarry as a Sith Lord of the Dark Side. Every time they did, Irizarry says, her group received more donations. Lucas remained conspicuously silent, but not his wife. After an unproductive meeting at her office with Irizarry, Hobson attacked the group in a scathing public statement: “As an African American who has spent my entire life in this city I love, it saddens me that young black and brown children will be denied the chance to benefit from what this museum will offer.” Chicagoans pointed out there were plenty of alternative sites besides the downtown waterfront. Obama’s library, for example, will be in Jackson Park, on the edge of a predominantly poor black neighborhood. “That was good enough for Barack Obama,” the Tribune’s Kamin says. “It wasn’t good enough for George Lucas and Mellody Hobson.”In June, Lucas announced he was abandoning Chicago and taking his project back to California.The Lucas museum continues to evolve. In August the Chronicle published a lengthy piece by its art critic, Charlie Desmarais, who’d been given what the newspaper called “an exclusive first look” at the filmmaker’s collection at his estate in Marin County. It seemed like a tactical shift for Lucas—an indication that he could see that the elites needed to be stroked rather than scorned. Desmarais, a former museum director himself, wrote that he made two visits to Skywalker Ranch and spent hours talking to Bacigalupi, an old acquaintance. As expected, much of Lucas’s trove was decidedly prosaic; along with Star Wars items, Desmarais found illustrations from Winnie the Pooh books, R. Crumb comic book art, Betty Boop drawings, Doonesbury strips, and a Rockwell assortment that now encompassed 147 works. The thread binding it all together might be hard for some to see, but Desmarais was impressed. “In fact, it may just be the core of a great museum,” he wrote.Meanwhile, Lucas was talking with the mayors of two of California’s largest cities. Los Angeles’s Garcetti concedes his town is the underdog, but he insists L.A. can offer a site downtown, in Exposition Park, with no delays. “We told George we have all the stars lined up to get this done and get it done quickly,” he says.However, Lucas’s preference is probably San Francisco, where he’s looking at a site on Treasure Island, a former U.S. Navy base on a man-made island with a magnificent view of the city skyline. There’s not much there, aside from a few former military buildings and some low-income housing. The island isn’t easy to get to; it can be reached only via the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge. But the city rather than the federal government controls Treasure Island, which means a smoother approval process than at the Presidio. And unlike the Presidio or Chicago’s Museum Campus, Treasure Island could use some help from Lucas. “George Lucas’s problem is that he keeps going after these premier urban sites,” says Mitchell Moss, an urban studies professor at New York University. “He needs to trade down. Treasure Island could be perfect for him. There’s not much there now. This would give people a reason to go.”And Lucas has creative connections to the Bay Area, notes Adam Van de Water, who’s overseeing the project for Mayor Lee. Lucas shot some Ewok battle scenes in The Return of the Jedi in nearby Muir Woods, Van de Water says, and segments of THX 1138 in the BART Tunnel. Some believe the cranes at the Port of Oakland inspired the AT-AT walkers in The Empire Strikes Back, though Lucas has denied that. Even Treasure Island had a cameo in a Lucas movie. “The Berlin airport in Indiana Jones 4 was the Treasure Island administration building,” Van de Water says.The island seems to have inspired a better design by Lucas’s architect, Ma. The Chronicle’s King didn’t like Lucas’s blueprint for the Presidio, and he dismissed the Chicago building as a “big lumpy mountain.” But he says the proposal for Treasure Island has a certain snazziness that defies description. “Is it a sports car?” he says. “Is it a stingray jumping out of the water? Is it a skull? If we’re all going to have to start looking at iconic, metaphorical architecture, this is a lot more interesting than a big lump.” '),\n",

       "  'ILLUSTRATOR: BENJAMIN BOURS; ANIMATOR: STEPH DAVIDSONPark West, the biggest art gallery in the world, knows how to sell at sea—where there’s bad Wi-Fi and plenty of Champagne.Among the passengers gathered for the art auction, the guy sitting in front of me seemed the most likely to have attended just for the free booze. The advertisements left in our staterooms had promised Champagne, and amid the smart polo shirts and sundresses, this middle-aged man stood out as exceptionally casual: a white tank top with a faded “Virginia Beach” graphic, black athletic shorts, and a blue baseball cap pulled down close to his eyeglasses. It was 11:15 a.m., and our cruise ship, the Norwegian Epic, was transiting the strait between Sardinia and Corsica, taking almost 6,000 passengers and crew on an eastward course to mainland Italy. As the auction staff ushered in potential bidders, a waiter approached with a silver tray of bubbly. The man in the tank top scooped up a flute. “Breakfast!” he said.Before bidding could start, the auctioneer instructed us to explore scores of artworks set up on easels around the room—impressionistic seasides, twee cottages by Thomas Kinkade, the Statue of Liberty as rendered by Peter Max, and a surreal composition featuring an anthropomorphic cocktail olive.My Champagne-sampling neighbor’s name was Chuck Bialon, from Pittsburgh. He said he’d been to dozens of these auctions over the years and whispered a warning: “It’s a shell game.” Gallery staff milled about within earshot, offering potential collectors special prebid prices at what they said were steep discounts. Bialon, his voice lowered, outlined the hidden danger. The spotty onboard Wi-Fi made it next to impossible to Google around for fair-market prices, he said—and also made it unlikely passengers would learn that the company running the auction, Park West Gallery, has long been accused by angry customers of selling overpriced art as investments.Still, Bialon added, there was that time he’d bought a Rembrandt. Paid almost $12,000 for it on a Carnival cruise of the western Caribbean. Hangs on his dining room wall. I wanted to ask more, but the head auctioneer had seen me taking notes. For the moment, I needed to move along and mingle with others. The whiff of scandal surrounding high-seas art auctions was the reason I was on the Epic.Park West was founded in 1969, is based outside Detroit, and boasts it’s the world’s biggest art gallery. It sells pictures and sculptures at thousands of live auctions held on more than 100 ships each year. Norwegian, Royal Caribbean, and Carnival all host Park West. And they all get a cut of the revenue. Park West has had annual sales as high as $400 million and counted more than 2 million customers.With those big numbers come bitter complaints. Starting in 2008, a series of lawsuits have alleged abusive sales practices, including forged Salvador Dalí signatures and promises of investment gains. At least 21 Park West customers filed 11 legal claims across the U.S., according to a 2012 court filing the gallery made in a separate insurance dispute. Six of those class-action customer lawsuits were merged into a single, multidistrict litigation at Seattle’s U.S. District Court, according to a signed 2013 declaration Park West’s founder made in the insurance case. The core claim was that Park West sold art at inflated prices by using high-pressure tricks, appraisals based on no valid methodology, and false claims of authenticity. Price lists in the court record show passengers spent tens of thousands of dollars on works that weren’t one-of-a-kind originals. “The scheme targeted individuals who, while unawares relaxing on their vacations, are wined and dined by Park West and Cruise Line employees and are subjected to Defendants’ art fraud scheme,” a 2010 plaintiffs’ filing in the lawsuit said. Park West called the suit baseless but in 2011 agreed to a settlement that it says included partial refunds and the return of some art. The auction house says it’s changed some of its practices, including offering returns within 40 days and exchanges within 40 months.Norwegian and the rest of the cruise lines have continued to give Park West access to their captive audience of bored, boozed-up, and broadband-deprived passengers. Fresh lawsuits against the gallery have followed. In one instance, Rane Mazzeo, a brow-and-body waxer from Las Vegas, thought she’d conquered the art market when she stepped off a Norwegian ship on a spring day in 2011. She’d spent $29,809 with Park West while at sea; the auction house had given her appraisals that claimed the works were worth much more. Three years later, Mazzeo got an independent appraisal that put the actual market value at a third of what she’d paid. Mazzeo, 55, sued Park West in September 2015 for fraudulent misrepresentation. The company disputed the claims and was awarded legal fees after winning a motion to compel arbitration. The lawsuit was dismissed, and the parties settled their dispute. (Mazzeo declined to comment.) Norwegian, Royal Caribbean, and Carnival say they’ve required more consumer protections from Park West.Despite the litigation, Park West says art sales have never been better. The gallery’s perseverance was either an amazing corporate rebound or evidence they’d never done wrong. To find out, I booked a windowless cabin on the Epic for a counterclockwise voyage around the Mediterranean, from Italy to France to Spain and back again. Yes, I would be drawing a salary while on a weeklong cruise. But there were certain risks: In 2009, the captain of a Royal Caribbean ship had ordered his security force to put a New York teacher ashore—in Oslo, in the middle of his cruise—after he printed a leaflet warning fellow passengers about the Park West lawsuits. “One minute I was playing table tennis with my son, the next I was being escorted away,” he told the Independent newspaper. Royal Caribbean said at the time it removed the passenger because he continued to be difficult after being warned he was violating the guest conduct policy. To avoid such a fate, I wouldn’t advertise my mission. But neither would I conceal it, if asked.The Epic, like most modern cruise ships, is a shopping mall embedded in a floating hotel. At the top is Deck 15, with swimming pools, three water slides, and the main buffet restaurant. Decks 5 through 7, linked by escalators and staircases, contain restaurants, casinos, an atrium lobby, a pub with a bowling alley, theaters, boutiques, and a Cavern Club that’s home to an excellent Beatles cover band. Park West had its gallery in the forward section of Deck 5, a wood-paneled space about the size of a tennis court, rigged with spotlights that shone on a set of pictures that changed daily. Positioned next to two banks of elevators, the space drew a constant flow of cruisers. The auctions themselves were conducted in various venues around the ship.One day at sea, just before I came aboard, Scott Bisset walked into a midday auction in the Epic’s Bliss Ultra Lounge, a disco and cocktail bar with chain-mail curtains for walls and a small karaoke stage at the back. Bisset and his wife, Sharyn Miller, later told me that his outfit—board shorts and a yellow tank top—was part of a savvy strategy. “You don’t want them to think you have money,” Miller said. “Prices can go up.” They are an international couple: Although they live in Dubai, he’s from the U.K., where they own a house, and she spends time tending cattle at her family home in New Zealand. With Park West, Bisset and Miller said they knew what they were doing. They’d bought at an auction on a previous cruise and were happy return customers.After registering for a bid card that would be their auction paddle, Bisset, 48, and Miller, 51, walked the perimeter of the disco, examining the 300 pictures on display. They spotted four they liked, including a “limited edition” Kinkade lighthouse and a landscape of a bridge in France by the Chinese-born, North Carolina-based Daniel Wall. According to Park West’s website, Wall is the founder of a movement called “intense impressionism.” Before the auction started, Park West offered to combine the four works into a single lot and negotiated with Bisset and Miller a starting bid of $5,100. The figure was a steep discount from the gallery’s suggested retail price.Everyone took seats so that bidding could begin. At a podium on the disco’s stage, the chief auctioneer, Dillon Cilliers, read highlights from the terms and conditions printed on each bid card, emphasizing Item 1, which said “all sales are final” in bold, capital letters.The bidding was fast-paced, with Cilliers, a South African in a snappy suit, speaking in auctioneer patter and banging a wooden gavel on the side of his podium. Bisset and Miller’s lot came up. To “win,” they would only need for there to be no competing bids—and there weren’t. Sold, for $5,100! “It isn’t an auction as such, is it?” Miller said afterward. Nevertheless, she added, “I think we saved three grand.” Bisset and Miller also bought another Wall, of New York’s Central Park ($570), and a second Kinkade lighthouse ($1,150).It was on canvas, but was it a painting? It was difficult to say. Up close, you could see daubs and brushstrokes that gave the picture three-dimensional texture in a few places. “I think they call them a serigraph,” Miller said. “He highlights and paints different parts of it.”Mostly, Park West doesn’t sell works that are unique in the sense that most casual collectors might understand. With a few high-end exceptions, it sells what are, essentially, reproductions with individual embellishments, such as a signature. The official terms include giclée, a type of inkjet print; serigraph, or silk-screen; and “mixed media,” which, in most of the Peter Max works, are paper lithographs with dabs of paint added. It took days of me hanging around the gallery and attending auctions to understand this—and I’ve covered art sales for years as a journalist, with the benefit of a Ph.D. in archaeology. Seeing actual brushstrokes threw me off. I finally saw in the Park West catalog, a copy of which is placed in every Epic stateroom, that the “intense impressionist” pictures were actually “hand embellished giclée on canvas.”In fact, according to the company, most of Park West’s art is mass-produced to some degree. Those Kinkades Miller bid on? She won’t be getting the exact ones. Instead, she’ll get others from the same series, sent from Park West’s Florida framing and shipping facility. That way, the shipboard floor samples can stay where they are. It’s spelled out in the terms and conditions, Item 16: If you buy an embellished or mixed media work, “you likely will instead receive a unique work that is a variation of the example displayed.” Bisset, who works as the finance director of a company in Dubai, had read the fine print. “I know these pictures are not originals,” he said. “I know they are limited-edition copies. I’ve either got to want them or not.”In all, Bisset and Miller spent $7,079 that afternoon. By evening, the rush had worn off. Reality hit as the couple sat on their stateroom’s balcony taking in the sea air, Miller sipping a Jack Daniel’s and lemonade while her husband drank Grolsch. “We suddenly thought, How much have we spent?” Miller said. “We need to start buying originals if we’re going to be spending that kind of money. Something where there’s not another copy of it.”We were anchored off Cannes when the good stuff went up on the walls of Deck 5. There was a signed, numbered Joan Miró lithograph of colored squiggles, a Henri Matisse print, and a few black-and-white Marc Chagall etchings. The biggest display was a set of six Salvador Dalí prints I immediately recognized—and couldn’t believe were being sold. In the 1940s, Dalí had collaborated with Walt Disney on a short film, Destino, for which the surrealist master drew some storyboards. The project wasn’t completed during either of their lifetimes but was later revived by Disney’s nephew Roy, whose animators turned out a seven-minute film in 2003. For the release, Disney created a set of numbered prints based on frames of the film. By 2008, Park West was offering a set of six Destino prints for $11,000, discounted from what it said was an appraisal value of $22,000.Years later, those valuations didn’t hold up. A quick Google check (we were in port, and I had phone reception) showed recent auction estimates of $200 to $300 per Destino print. On Craigslist, someone with a set that had passed through Park West was trying to offload five for $4,000, including the company’s frames and certificates of authenticity. The Destinos also showed up in the class-action litigation against Park West; the plaintiffs cited a Dalí expert who valued the prints at $100 each.On the Epic, I was eager to learn how much Park West was asking and returned that evening for a VIP reception. Park West galleristas and their guests were decked out in cocktail dresses, jackets, and ties. A table was laid out with crackers, cubed cheese, and more Champagne. Several times I heard a staff member say “I love your dress” to a potential collector.Bisset and Miller were there, invited because they’d been big spenders. As Miller checked out the newly hung pictures, her husband was at Cilliers’s desk in the back, watching a video on a laptop. It was a promo for artist Chris DeRubeis, with narration that described him as the pioneer of “abstract sensualism.” A little later, Bisset examined some serigraphs by Anatole Krasnyansky, pointing out the recurring Venetian carnival motif in each. Cilliers complimented his customer’s eye. “That’s what makes him him,” the auctioneer said.I asked a staffer for prices on the Miró, which I really liked, and the Dalí Destino set. She checked a price list in a binder. The Miró was $14,000, and the Dalí Destino set could be mine for $14,900.The irony of spending day after day examining hand-embellished giclées in the Mediterranean was that at every port, we could easily find some of the finest art humanity has ever produced. Before boarding the Epic in Rome, I’d caught the train to the port at St. Peter’s Basilica, steps from Michelangelo’s Sistine Chapel. The next day we hit Tuscany, where shore excursions included trips to Florence’s Uffizi Gallery, with Botticelli’s Birth of Venus. In Cannes, I took the train to Nice to see the Chagalls. And in Barcelona, I went to the hilltop Joan Miró Foundation’s museum, hoping to learn more about the lithograph of his I’d seen aboard. The museum gift shop had some similar pieces for about $400, but they weren’t signed.The next day, during the crossing to Naples, was the day I met Bialon, owner of the Rembrandt. He wasn’t there for the free booze after all. He was interested in a Kinkade on canvas for his house and had arranged a prebid for about $1,200, he said. That’s when my note taking finally became too obvious. Cilliers, the chief auctioneer, said he’d noticed I was writing a lot. I fessed up and waited for nautical security to swarm.Instead, Cilliers’s first reaction was to seem embarrassed that I hadn’t seen enough big sales. Americans are Park West’s target market, he said, and they made up only about 10 percent of the Epic’s manifest. If I wanted to see how well they normally do, Cilliers said, I should check out a cruise from New York. Otherwise, for any comment I’d need to contact headquarters. And that was it. I wasn’t sent to Oslo.About 40 people showed up to that day’s sale, in a lounge called Le Bistro. Wearing a dark suit and lime-green tie, Cilliers told newcomers that if they wanted the free Champagne or raffle tickets, they needed to sign up for a bid card. Once they were seated, he made clear he wanted buyers, not oglers. “If you’re here to watch the show,” he said, “you’re in the wrong place.” A waiter passed flutes of mimosas and Champagne. “This isn’t television,” Cilliers said, pointing to his eyes and then back at the audience. “I can see you.”Cilliers started with a Peter Max of a man holding an umbrella—a “one-of-a-kind” on canvas. Estimated retail was $23,800, he said, but he’d start bidding at $20,000. After a flurry of unintelligible auctionese, Cilliers banged his gavel on the side of the podium and asked for a round of applause for the Max. It hadn’t sold, but that didn’t seem to be the point. He’d conditioned the crowd into thinking anything under five figures might be a bargain.Soon, Cilliers racked up sales. A bronze statue of a cat, retail $6,400, went to a sole bidder for $4,900. Then a trio of pictures came to the block, valued at $19,150. An American couple had arranged a first bid of $9,790 and was hoping nobody pushed it higher. Cilliers searched the room for competitors, found none, and banged his wooden hammer. The room erupted with applause. The husband, the back of his buzz-cut neck flushed red, beamed with relief.Cilliers also sold a vellum manuscript page, with red and black Latin script on it that he described as “a piece of history,” to another lone bidder for $4,100, as well as a giclée of leopards by Andrew Bone to a man wearing a Yankees T-shirt for $1,025. (When I spoke to the Yankees fan later, he referred to the purchase as a “painting on canvas,” and I didn’t have the heart to tell him otherwise.)The American couple’s $9,790 purchase had earned them the close attention of Park West staff. One perched herself over their shoulders, whispering. Minutes later, Cilliers offered a Romero Britto picture, saying it was worth up to $4,200 but could be had for a bid of $1,390. The couple, now the toasts of Le Bistro, nodded. Cilliers banged the gavel as his assistant offered the couple more Champagne.Amid the auction lots came games. Park West is known for sprinkling in diversions like raffles and mystery items. (At one auction I won a gift box with a watch, pen, and case for business cards. I gave it to the Filipino man who cleaned my stateroom.) Another tactic is bidding by elimination. I watched as an assistant brought out a print valued at $300, and Cilliers asked anyone willing to pay $5 to raise his bid card. “If you don’t have $5,” he said, “I’ll give you $5.” Almost every card in the room went up. Cilliers started to increase the price, and a few cards went down each time. At $70, I counted eight bid cards still up, when he abruptly concluded the bidding, taking in a quick $560. It would’ve been confusing for anyone who didn’t understand that that exact picture wasn’t for sale—that Park West had hundreds, possibly thousands, of identical copies from the print run in its warehouse. (Some sore winners of such rounds later told me they’d thought the game would continue until there was a single remaining bidder, leaving them time to drop out.)To finish off with a bang, Cilliers filled the stage with five Peter Max pictures worth, he said, $31,460—but available for $9,999. No takers. He added a sixth image to the bargain. It was of the Statue of Liberty surrounded by votive candles, flowers, and an American flag.“What was yesterday?” Cilliers asked the crowd.“Monday!” they shouted.Cilliers, with a beleaguered look, reminded them that it had been the anniversary of Sept. 11. He continued sweetening the deal with more pictures, until there were 10 Maxes in all, still for $9,999. No one bid, and the crowd filed out toward the casino.When the Epic returned me to Rome, the first thing I did at my desk was research whether the Miró lithograph I’d admired was a good deal at $14,000. It turned out to be part of a set of 39 sold by Christie’s in London in March 2015 for the equivalent of about $96,000 at the time. Just 13 were signed. The most generous valuation I could come up with—assigning a value of zero to the unsigned ones—put the price of a single signed picture at $7,400. Later I found a precise figure: In 2011, Swann Auction Galleries in New York had sold one of the Mirós for $3,360, including fees. Sure, prices shift from year to year. But had I paid what could be seen as Park West’s 317 percent markup, I’d have joined their roster of unhappy customers.Being safely off the ship, I got in touch with Park West’s founder and chief executive officer, Albert Scaglione. “We’re not out there cheating people,” he said over the phone. Scaglione said that since the lawsuits he’s beefed up his compliance department, which reviews videos of every auction. He disputed that Park West’s prices are inflated, arguing they’re the market prices for his way of selling art. “We’re not Sotheby’s or Christie’s,” he said.Scaglione, 77, did say he was sympathetic about the confusion during auctions regarding whether works were original paintings. “It’s often garbled, it goes too fast,” he said, suggesting he might introduce better signs explaining things. The seemingly high prices for prints that went for less on land? “You might find one in an obscure auction in Austria that sold for a third,” he said. “These things aren’t always available.” The Dalí Destino prints? Park West had set its prices as the exclusive marketer of the prints, he said, and any other prices are, at best, from “people who bought from us, who are selling,” he said. He also said, “how do you know it’s not a forged Destino?”I told Scaglione that I’d noticed one reform on the Epic: Not once did I hear the auctioneers make promises of investment return. In fact, the two times I asked about price appreciation, separate staffers gave the same response: “We can’t predict the future.” Scaglione told me, “The place we’re at now is so nice. Did we ever have an auctioneer selling art as an investment? We did. We fired them.”One thing Scaglione didn’t want to discuss was Park West’s 2011 settlement. I had found, buried in the docket for a separate case, the amount the company had paid to resolve the matter, including legal fees and damages: $1,154,435.47. During a good year, that would be a single day of revenue. It explained a lot about the company’s durability.Rembrandt was the last Park West mystery to solve. Bialon had said he’d tell me the whole story when he got back to his house in Pennsylvania, where the retired computer systems analyst spends his time breeding tropical fish in 40 aquariums he keeps in his basement. By phone, he said he picked up the Old Master on a Park West cruise seven years ago. It was a self-portrait etching of the artist wearing a flat cap. It had been printed in the 1800s from copper plates that Rembrandt van Rijn made during his lifetime in the 1600s, according to the Park West appraisal that came with the picture. The document valued the etching at $11,800, the same Bialon had paid for it.But nowhere did the appraisal say where the etching had come from—its provenance. Now Bialon wanted to know. “The thing has been sitting around for a couple hundred years,” he said. “Somebody had it.” In late September, Bialon called Park West, gave them the registration number off the appraisal, and asked if they could send him the picture’s history. At first Bialon was told he’d get the information in the mail in a week. When nothing arrived, he called and got bounced around, only to be told he’d get a certificate of authenticity and nothing more.When I spoke to Scaglione, he was aware of Bialon’s case and was firm about refusing him the provenance. “We get things from families, we get them from clients,” he said. “We do not and will not provide the sources.”The day before this article went to press, Scaglione sent me an e-mail. It was another chance to observe how Park West operates. During our earlier phone call he had requested that I not use an audio recorder. Now he revealed that he’d been using a recorder on his end and suggested I submit for his verification “anything whatsoever that I said.” Scaglione also wrote, “[W]e have video tapes of all the auctions you attended” on the Epic. “We have a video of each work of art that came up and when you took notes and when you did not.” In at least this one respect, Park West has learned to value the art of authentication.The massive U.S. apparatus for holding immigrants has a long American tradition.

       "  'In September 2013, Marlien Rentmeester, founder of the fashion site Le Catch, was combing the racks at Shareen Vintage in Manhattan’s Chelsea neighborhood, when a fuchsia A-line frock caught her eye. “It was so shockingly pink, so cool and different, that I wore it out of the store,” she says. “On the street, women were giving me compliments left and right.” Rentmeester, the former West Coast editor for shopping magazine Lucky, had a sharp eye. In the months that followed, she started seeing pink everywhere: on streetwear blogs, in ad campaigns for Acne Studios and online beauty company Glossier, and in the pantsuits worn by Hillary Clinton.Fast-forward to 2016, and pink is an even greater phenomenon. Rentmeester long considered pink “fussy, dainty, babyish, or even weak.” Now she says the color is emblematic of women on the rise financially, culturally, and politically—even if Clinton’s pink pantsuits didn’t get as much attention as the pink pussy-bow Gucci blouse Melania Trump wore to the second presidential debate. (Some pundits suggested the bow was a subtle rebuke to her husband’s critics after the “grab them by the p----” tape leaked.) “We interpret our environment through the colors we wear,” Rentmeester says. “Pink is unapologetic, dramatic, and bold. We’re taking it back and making it our own.” That reclamation is a story that’s not just about skirts, pantsuits, and blouses, but about how fashion can upend larger cultural ideas about power and gender.Brands have long marketed pink in retrograde ways. Until recently, the NFL took a “pink-it-and-shrink-it” approach to women’s wear, making bubble-gum-colored jerseys in women’s sizes rather than offering choices in team colors, a strategy the league started phasing out early this decade. And pink products are often considered specialty items; as such, they’re routinely priced higher than identical products marketed to men, according to a 2015 report by the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs.Now, companies are imbuing pink with all sorts of positive associations, tapping into the same vibe Rentmeester felt. This fall, J.Crew—a struggling company but still a bellwether of mass tastes—promoted its new line around hundreds of custom-developed shades of pink. In an e-mail, Jenna Lyons, president and creative director, explained that pink was worthy of the same rebrand as a once-sidelined vegetable: “If kale can have its own marketing team, so can pink! We feel that color is a natural mood enhancer, and like kale, it is good for you.” Where J.Crew is promoting the color as a path to happiness, high-fashion brands such as Gucci and Chanel have recast it as funky and cool, with pink bomber jackets and bowler hats, respectively. Even cookware maker Le Creuset launched a series of hibiscus-hued pots and platters this year because it provided “vibrancy” and a “strong anchor” for the company’s spring line, says Will Copenhaver, marketing communications director.“A color becomes popular because it’s symbolic of the age we’re living in. These are turbulent times. People are looking for calm”The idea that the color could be something other than a feminine stereotype isn’t new. Historically, “there were no strong gender associations with pink,” says Michelle Finamore, curator of fashion arts at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. Until World War I, babies of both genders were dressed in white because stains were more easily bleached. Even when stores began to introduce “baby pink” and “baby blue” into kids’ departments, they weren’t divided by gender. A 1918 article in Earnshaw’s Infants’ Department, a trade publication, explained that “pink, being a more decided and stronger color, is more suitable for the boy, while blue, which is more delicate and dainty, is prettier for the girl.”J.Crew has created more than 300 different shades of pink in its clothing lines, including heather blossom (sweater), dusty dahlia (blazer), soft berry (pants), and coral rose (shoes).Jo Paoletti, author of Pink and Blue: Telling the Boys From the Girls in America, says modern associations with the colors “took generations” to sink in. It was only after World War II that brands began marketing pastels to women, largely as an antidote to the military-inspired fashions and textile rationing of wartime. Catalogs advertised pink appliances, wallpaper, and upholstery. Bathrooms and kitchens were painted “Mamie” pink, so named for Dwight Eisenhower’s wife, who wore a pink peau de soie gown to the 1953 inaugural ball. In 1955, Dodge introduced the pink and white La Femme, a two-door hardtop that came with a matching umbrella, purse, compact, and lipstick case. At the time, families were starting to buy multiple cars, and women were more involved in the decision.And yet the company stopped producing La Femmes a year later. “Pink as a marketing device was just too limiting,” says Virginia Scharff, author of Taking the Wheel: Women and the Coming of the Motor Age. “Buying a pink lipstick is not that big an investment. Buying a pink car is a different order of magnitude.” By the mid-1960s, brands were no longer exhorting women to “think pink.” The counterculture drove fashion, in particular, from the latter half of the decade through the ’70s; young people of both genders were more inclined to wear flowered patterns and vibrant colors.Fashion historians say our recent understanding of pink as an explicitly feminine color only emerged in the ’80s, when it became common for parents to learn the sex of their unborn babies. This created a marketing opportunity, says Paoletti, as stores could sell boy and girl versions of everything. And because pink had been associated with women in the ’50s, it became the de facto girl’s color. (See: the 1986 John Hughes classic Pretty in Pink, starring Molly Ringwald.) But, Paoletti says, there’s a distinction between how people viewed the color in the ’50s vs. the ’80s and ’90s. “In the 1950s, pink was presented as a fashion, a cultural choice,” she says, whereas later on “it was presented as part of [girls’] nature.” This happened with help from Walt Disney’s $5.5 billion princess empire. The irony is that Disney itself proves the nature argument wrong. Not one of the iconic princesses drawn prior to 1960 is known solely for wearing pink. Snow White (1937), Cinderella (1950), and the Sleeping Beauty (1959) are all featured in blue. In Peter Pan (1953), it’s baby Michael who appears in pink footsie pajamas.With the reappropriation of pink, millennial women have turned the dictate back into a choice. It’s why the cover of #GirlBoss, Sophia Amoruso’s best-seller about taking charge at work, is pale pink. It’s why Stephanie Danler, who wrote the hit coming-of-age novel Sweetbitter, was so excited when she first saw her book’s salmon-pink cover. “I know that women have an ambivalent relationship with pink because it symbolizes femininity and has been traditionally weak,” she says. “But I saw it as a statement color, as challenging.” She thought millennial women would feel the same way, and she was right. Since May the novel has sold more than 100,000 copies, and the cover has been tagged at least 2,500 times on Instagram—which Knopf told Danler is unusual for a book jacket. Some people at the publisher worried the cover would alienate male readers, she says, but in fact, pink’s cross-gender appeal is part of its popularity: “There’s so much androgyny and fluidity that I didn’t think people”—men or women—“would be scared of the color,” Danler says.The un-gendering of pink helps explain why Gucci, Off-White, and Pigalle all released pink menswear in 2016—and why the buzziest color of Common Projects sneakers, a favorite label among stylish men, was blush. It also explains why the Pantone Color Institute, which analyzes global color trends, named rose quartz a 2016 color of the year. Laurie Pressman, the institute’s vice president, says pale pink is associated with wellness and mindfulness. “A color becomes popular because it’s symbolic of the age we’re living in,” she says. “These are turbulent times. People are looking for calm.” She points to studies in which shades of pink have been shown to soothe unruly students or prisoners. Pantone found examples of companies that are “trying to help create balance for employees, reduce stress, and bring wellness-focused measures into the office space,” Pressman says, by using pink accents in décor. This year, for the first time, Pantone named a second color of the year: a pale blue called Serenity. As early as 2014, color experts began spotting an uptick in both shades across commercial spheres, often as complements to each other.Of course, now that pink has become chic among millennials, it’s fair to be skeptical of marketing that leverages the color. Are publishers and fashion houses interested in supporting a feminist cultural movement? Or are they just looking to sell books and footwear? How long until the backlash begins, if it hasn’t already? For now, those questions are less important than more practical ones. Historically, pink was marketed as a warm-weather color. “You’d never find it this time of the year,” Paoletti says. But that’s no longer true. A Le Catch reader recently asked if she could wear her pink Anne Fontaine moto jacket through November. Rentmeester’s answer was unequivocal: “Go for pink all winter long!”'),\n",

       "  'Surprise! Trump May Be Great for BusinessThe second-biggest surprise of November, after the election of Donald Trump, has been the warm reception the president-elect has gotten from businesses and investors. Before Nov. 8 the consensus was that a Trump victory would tank the stock market. Instead, stocks have risen. The dollar is up. Several economists have raised their projections for economic growth in 2017 and 2018. On Nov. 15 one of the most heeded figures in the investing world tiptoed up to the edge of saying something nice about the makeup of the embryonic Trump administration. “There’s a good chance that the ‘craziness’ factor will be smaller and play a lesser role in driving outcomes than many had feared,” Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, the world’s biggest hedge fund, wrote on LinkedIn. “Our very preliminary assessment is that on the economic front, the developments are broadly positive—the straws in the wind suggest that many of the people under consideration\\u2009…\\u2009probably won’t recklessly and stupidly drive the economy into a ditch.”Included in the new issue of Bloomberg Businessweek, Nov. 21-27, 2016. Subscribe nowEven some of Trump’s fiercest opponents are backing down from the equation that Trump equals calamity. In a Nov. 14 New York Times op-ed, Paul Krugman, the Nobel laureate economist, wrote that while he continues to believe electing Trump was a grave error, “don’t be surprised if economic growth actually accelerates for a couple of years.” Businesspeople who are weary of Washington gridlock are optimistic something might actually get done. This is the first time since Dwight Eisenhower was elected in 1952 that a Republican president will enter office with GOP majorities in both the House and the Senate. “It has been roses and sunshine,” Tom Cole, a Republican representative from Oklahoma, told reporters.How long will this honeymoon last? For American business, the positive scenario is that Trump appoints sensible people, matures in office, and puts most of his considerable energy into the pro-growth parts of his agenda. The negative scenario is that he goes back to being the inciter who flew off the Twitter handle so much during the campaign that his people temporarily seized control of his account.For now people are accentuating the positive, as this essay and several other stories in this issue reflect. Trump was presidentially gracious in his victory speech. He’s continued to talk up tax cuts, infrastructure spending, and deregulation. He named Reince Priebus—a conciliatory, conventional Republican—to be his chief of staff. He didn’t stand in the way of Paul Ryan’s reelection as speaker of the House. There was talk that he could name former Goldman Sachs partner Steven Mnuchin, who was his finance chairman, to be secretary of the Treasury. Part of that famous wall on the Mexican border will be a simple fence now, and the once-promised deportation force to expel undocumented aliens is gone from his rhetoric.Being positive about Trump means believing he won’t do many of the things he’s promisedStocks of financial companies in the S&P 500 jumped about 11 percent in the week after the election, presumably because investors believe Trump will dismantle the Dodd-Frank Act. Industrials rose almost 6 percent on hopes for infrastructure spending. The prospect of lower taxes on corporate profits is also good for stock prices.The market’s positive reaction might help steer Trump toward market-friendly measures. During the campaign, he basked in the adulation of his fans and emphasized the promises that drew the biggest applause and the most retweets, such as locking up Hillary Clinton. To Trump, the rise in the S&P 500 probably looks a lot like a standing ovation from Wall Street. If he’s true to form, he’ll want more applause from the stock market, which could lead him to adopt policies that are friendly to business.Despite being a billionaire, Trump never got much love from the business establishment. Through mid-October, just one chief executive officer of an S&P 100 company—David Farr of Emerson Electric—had donated to him. Eight gave to Clinton, including Apple’s Tim Cook, Verizon Communications’ Lowell McAdam, and Coca-Cola’s Muhtar Kent. But now that the election results are in, businesses are trying to accommodate to the new reality in Washington. There’s no percentage for a CEO in standing up against a president he or she doesn’t like. Transcripts of analyst calls compiled in Bloomberg’s Orange Book reveal the tone. Walt Disney CEO Robert Iger volunteered on Nov. 10 that the company has already prepared a bust of Trump to go into Disney World’s hall of presidents. Union Pacific Chief Financial Officer Robert Knight Jr. told analysts on Nov. 9, “I guess broadly said, I’m not pessimistic about where this is going to go,” even though UP is vulnerable to a trade war with Mexico because of its cross-border rail traffic.Business lobbyists, nothing if not politically agile, are soft-pedaling their differences with Trump over trade and immigration. They’d rather work out those disagreements in smoke-free back rooms than in the press. “What’s most important for the chamber and our members is that our country unites around a mission to have a stronger economy, not just for business but for our workers and the people of our country,” Myron Brilliant, executive vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said in an interview the day after the election.The bullish case for a Trump presidency is that corporate tax cuts will unleash investment in equipment, buildings, and software. Joseph LaVorgna, Deutsche Bank’s chief U.S. economist, predicted on Nov. 15 that the economy’s annual growth rate will accelerate from 2 percent in the first quarter to 2.5 percent in the second, to 3.5 percent in the third, and to 4 percent in the fourth, before ramping down gradually in 2018. “Last week’s election results were a seminal event and could have profound economic implications,” LaVorgna wrote. “Massive fiscal expansion could go a long way to restoring a much faster pace of economic activity.”It’s also quite possible that the Trump presidency will be an economic failure. The dirty secret of macroeconomics is that it’s actually easy for a sitting president to goose the gross domestic product higher for a year; increases in spending and cuts in taxes reliably do that, as Krugman conceded in his op-ed. The problem, which fiscal conservatives never tire of pointing out, is that a zap to GDP that’s achieved through deficit spending will have to be paid back with higher taxes that sap growth in the future. According to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, Trump’s plan, if enacted as written, would cause federal debt held by the public to swell to 105 percent of GDP in 10 years, up from 77 percent now. “The first principle is not to be fooled by increases in measured gross domestic product,” George Mason University economist Tyler Cowen wrote in a column for Bloomberg View.A higher tariff on imported goods is, of course, nothing more than a new taxCongressional Republicans resisted Keynesian economic stimulus when the unemployment rate was high and the economy could have used it more. Now that a Republican is entering the White House, markets are betting that the fiscal conservatives will set aside their principles and give Trump a victory. The spike in yields on Treasury bonds indicates market expectations of higher inflation resulting from stronger economic growth. But the economy could fall back into torpor if businesses and consumers lose faith that the spurt is sustainable.Trump’s expansion could end up benefiting the elites more than the masses. The Wall Street rally is enriching the stockholding upper-middle class, while the runup in interest rates is penalizing the people who need to borrow to buy the car that gets them to work. Meanwhile, the president who inveighed against trade deficits could actually cause them to expand by revving growth. “The boost to domestic demand from the fiscal stimulus will draw in more imports, counteracting the desired goal of shrinking the trade deficit,” write Macroeconomic Advisers economists Chris Varvares and Joel Prakken. Likewise, a tit-for-tat tariff war with Mexico or China would whack the poor and working class more than the rich because more of their income goes for goods, vs. services such as ballet tickets or tummy tucks. A higher tariff on imported goods is, of course, nothing more than a new tax.Trump won the election by making promises to his core constituents that were even more extravagant than the average candidate’s. He pledged to rebuild the military, protect Social Security and Medicare, and pay down the national debt, all while cutting taxes dramatically. Fulfilling any one of those four promises is possible, but doing all four at once defies logic. On the stump, Trump said he would at least double the economy’s 2 percent annual GDP growth rate and even talked about reaching 5 percent or 6 percent. But labor force growth is dwindling as boomers retire, and productivity growth depends on business investment and technological advances, which have been chronically weak. While growth-friendly tax policy could help, there’s no button in the Oval Office that says, “Press here for a stronger economy.” All of this is not what Trump’s supporters are prepared to hear right now: Gallup reported that the percentage of Republican voters who think the economy is getting better tripled, to 49 percent, from right before the election to right after.The collision of hope and reality is likely to happen as soon as March, just two months after Trump’s inauguration, when the suspension of the ceiling on the federal debt ends. Republicans in Congress who used the debt ceiling as a weapon against President Obama are unlikely to roll over for Trump, especially because many aren’t convinced he’s one of them. “Republicans control Washington, but the meaning of the term ‘Republican’ has never been less clear,” Nuveen Asset Management senior portfolio manager Robert Doll wrote in a note to clients.One of the first budgetary casualties could be Trump’s promise—a hit with business—to unleash $1 trillion in private infrastructure spending over the next 10 years. His economic advisers claim the spending wouldn’t raise the budget deficit because the only cost would be government inducements, in the form of credits against investors’ federal tax bills. The hope is that the loss on the credits would be offset by new taxes on the wages and profits of contractors. But the innovative formula might not pencil out with skeptical budget analysts.The mixed signals from Trump’s transition team are also unnerving to business. Politically, Trump can’t fill his cabinet and inner circle entirely with boardroom types—his supporters would feel betrayed. He offset the appointment of Priebus as chief of staff by naming Steve Bannon to be his senior counselor and chief West Wing strategist. “Crony capitalism has gotten out of control,” Bannon told Bloomberg Businessweek after the election. “Trump saw this. The American people saw this. And they have risen up to smash it.”One difficulty for business executives is that to be optimistic about a Trump presidency requires believing he won’t do many of the things he said he would do. If his positive agenda doesn’t produce results, he may be tempted to go negative, expelling millions of illegal immigrants or threatening trade wars with Mexico and China. Tech stocks have fallen slightly even as the overall market is up, a move that analysts attributed to fears of a trade war that would cripple supply chains and crimp sales.While plenty of analysts have asked whether Trump might cause a financial crisis, fewer have pondered how he will react to a financial crisis that isn’t his fault. Henry Kaufman, the former head of research at Salomon Brothers, says deregulation-minded Trump could find himself fighting a fire that begins with the failure of a bank that’s too big to fail. Kaufman, 89, known as Dr. Doom, began his Wall Street career in 1949. “We’re much more at the financial edge than we were then,” he says. Already, the jump in U.S. interest rates and the rise of the dollar are putting pressure on emerging-market economies where people borrow in dollars, says Quentin Fitzsimmons, a global fixed-income portfolio manager at T. Rowe Price. That could be the start of an international crisis that would entangle the White House. “It’s plausible to argue that the risks to the rest of the world are higher than to the U.S. economy itself,” Fitzsimmons says.The truth is that no one yet knows what Trump will do as president, not even Trump. After the election, Goldman Sachs’s index of U.S. economic policy uncertainty spiked to its highest level since it began in 1985. The enmity toward elites that Trump stirred up during the campaign may be stronger and more enduring than even he realizes, and it could impede his ability to get things done. “The rise of populism, the impact on sentiment, will continue far beyond the November election,” Henry McVey, head of global macro and asset allocation at private equity giant KKR, predicted before the election.For people who have turned optimistic on Trump, it’s a case of “shoot first, ask questions later,” says Steven Ricchiuto, chief economist at Mizuho Securities USA. “This is the first growth story they’ve had in eight and a half years, and they’re going to run with it.”Trump backer Peter Thiel, the billionaire venture capitalist, popularized an observation by writer Salena Zito of the Atlantic, which is that the press takes Trump literally but not seriously, while his supporters take him seriously but not literally. For business executives, taking him seriously but not literally amounts to believing in the parts of his message that make sense to them and discounting the parts that they think are beyond the pale.'),\n",

       "  'Hannah Harper is a harried businesswoman, obsessed with her career and her smartphone, who’s involved with the wrong guy and prioritizing the wrong things. After arriving in the upstate New York hamlet of Cookie Jar—yes, Cookie Jar—to arrange for the sale of the town’s beloved cookie factory to the National Foods conglomerate, she meets the plant’s reluctant seller, the handsome and affable Jake Carter. He’s in debt up to his chocolate chips, but he isn’t too thrilled with Hannah and her plans to move his family’s bakery to Buffalo. Two hours later, after a tour de force of sparkly seasonal tidings that includes but isn’t limited to snowman building, sled racing, town square tree trimming, cookie tasting, pie baking, gingerbread house decorating (Hannah judges the competition), Christmas Eve dancing, and the singing of O Christmas Tree by an angelic fourth grader, Hannah’s icy corporate shell melts. She persuades her Scroogey boss to keep the factory where it is, ditches her soulless tool of a boyfriend, and falls into Jake’s well-toned arms.So goes the plot of Christmas Cookies, a Hallmark Channel original movie premiering on Nov. 13. If you’re reading this and thinking, Sweet Jesus, I missed it!, fear not: It’ll be rerun, over and over, along with 18—yes, 18—other new movies in Hallmark’s Countdown to Christmas series, which started before Halloween and runs until New Year’s Day.“It’s very formulaic. But if you look at other successful programming in the marketplace, it’s all formulaic. It’s why there’s a\\u202fLaw & Order franchise”In a television landscape stuffed fatter than a Christmas goose, Hallmark’s original yuletide offerings are more popular than ever. A Wish for Christmas, which kicked off the series’ 15th year on Oct. 29, had 3.4 million viewers, up from the 1.1 million who watched 2015’s premiere, making it the most successful opening film in the countdown’s history. Well before the ratings were in, the Hallmark Channel was tapped by the National Park Foundation to broadcast the National Christmas Tree Lighting ceremony in Washington on Dec. 1, a first for a nonbroadcast network. And parent company Hallmark Cards announced this year that it would hand over the reins of its most treasured media brand—the Hallmark Hall of Fame anthology, at 65 years the longest continuously running franchise in TV history, with 80 Emmy Awards to its credit—to Hallmark Channel after most recently airing it on CBS.Michelle VicaryThe woman in charge of all this schmaltz is Michelle Vicary. As executive vice president for programming and publicity at the two Hallmark cable networks (Movies & Mysteries is the other), she’s responsible for everything that goes on the air—and can take credit for much of its success. “We tap into what’s happening in people’s lives,” Vicary says. “We tap into how they’re feeling, how they’re anticipating” the joy of the holidays. She talks at length about the public legacy of Hallmark and deploys the phrase “leaning into the brand” frequently and without irony. And she won’t apologize for the torrent of treacle she releases every holiday season: “Our audience says, ‘Not only can I spend two hours and feel better watching a Christmas movie, but I can watch it with my family, and I can feel safe that they are entertained as well.’\\u2009”Here’s what you won’t find in a Hallmark movie: sex, drugs, violence, leads of color (“Um\\u2009…\\u2009we are taking a look at that,” Vicary says), unattractive actors, a lack of snow, or unhappy people (unless they’re about to find love or the true meaning of Christmas). The formula is rigid; it’s the same thing, all the time—the video equivalent of a fast-food burger, fries, and a milkshake, which is why viewers eat it up. “On a Saturday night, people want to watch a movie where they know what’s going to happen, and it’s going to have a happy ending, and you’re going to need a tissue by your couch. People love that,” says Michael Law, executive vice president and managing director for Dentsu Aegis Network, a media planning agency. He places more than $4 billion in advertising for clients such as JM Smucker and Pfizer every year, including a good chunk at Hallmark. “It’s very formulaic,” he says. “But if you look at other successful programming in the marketplace, it’s all formulaic. It’s why there’s a Law & Order franchise.”Crown Media Holdings, the subsidiary of Hallmark Cards that’s home to the Hallmark Channel, decided six years ago to make the last two months of the year “all Christmas, all the time,” Vicary says. Then she was told to monetize it. In her 15 years with the company—which began with a stint as manager of programming and on-air promotion, then extended through positions in scheduling, administration, and acquisitions before she rose to her present role—she’s shown a talent for producing the kind of mawkish romances that resonate with Hallmark’s core audience of 25- to 54-year-old suburban moms. The genre has put the channel at or near the top of basic cable ratings every December for the past decade, and the network has had modest success with forays into original series, most recently with the G-rated soap Chesapeake Shores. “When I first got here, Lifetime was always beating us,” says Randy Pope, Hallmark’s senior vice president for original programming, planning, and acquisitions, who’s worked at Crown Media since 2002. “That started to switch under Michelle—reaching this real sense of what our brand is, staying focused on it.” Vicary calls it Hallmark’s “secret sauce.”With its output of original movies almost five times what it was just seven years ago, the network requires more resources to make that sauce; each film costs $2.1 million to $2.2 million. At a July status meeting at the Crown Media offices overlooking Los Angeles’s Hollywood Hills, Vicary ran down the list of in-progress productions with key executives. There was Christmas Cookies, for which the producers secured the rights to a Stevie Wonder song; A Wish for Christmas, a revised cut of which had just been delivered; My Christmas Dream, which was to begin filming the following week with Danica McKellar, best known as Winnie on The Wonder Years; A Worthwhile Life, which “needs more Christmas in it,” one exec lamented; and Finding Father Christmas, which “looks gorgeous,” Vicary gushed.Vicary’s success comes as Hallmark Cards reaches a crossroads. Owned and run by the secretive Hall family for more than a century, the $3.7 billion company employs fewer than half of the 22,000 who worked for it just six years ago. Revenue slid by more than $300 million from 2012 to 2015, a reflection of a world in which people send texts and emojis instead of cards to acknowledge birthdays and anniversaries. For the past 15 years, Crown Media had operated as a public company, with Hallmark Cards its majority shareholder; in March the parent company announced its subsidiary was going private. In a letter to Crown’s board of directors, Hallmark Cards Chief Executive Officer Donald Hall Jr. cited the company’s intent to leverage Crown’s success and “to strengthen the link between Crown’s channels and Hallmark’s businesses.” In other words, the company would ride Santa’s ermine-trimmed coattails.“We are going to be your Christmas destination”Hallmark faces the same daunting market pressures as other channels. As independents in a cable landscape dominated by media conglomerates that can cross-pollinate content among platforms, Hallmark’s channels have little sway as they negotiate fees with advertisers, carriers, and talent. “Obviously, we are not the size of Disney or Viacom,” says Bill Abbott, Crown Media’s CEO. “But we have assets they don’t, like retail outlets and consumer awareness, that are unique.” And the cord-cutting phenomenon threatens the long-term viability of many cable networks, independent or otherwise.Vicary knows the popularity of her syrupy movies is an invitation to imitation—this is show business, after all—and she keeps close tabs on such competitors as Lifetime and Freeform (formerly ABC Family), the latter of which has enjoyed success with its 25 Days of Christmas programming. It should be noted that the franchising of the Christmas cable movie didn’t actually start at Hallmark but at ABC Family’s previous incarnation, Fox Family Channel, developed by Abbott before he jumped to Hallmark. But Vicary is the one who’s run with it. There’s irony in the fact that Hallmark’s holiday movies, Crown’s biggest revenue generator, regularly use corporate greed as a theme.Look for ironies in Vicary’s success as a Christmas whisperer, and you’ll start to see them everywhere. The biggest one? Perhaps that she’s saving a parent company whose 1950s-style sentiments are out of fashion by making movies that make you feel like you’re back in the ’50s. “We put our stake in the ground, or whatever that cliché is, and said, ‘We are going to be your Christmas destination,’\\u2009” she says. “The more we’ve done, the more they want.”Chisel into the fruitcake, pour yourself some eggnog, and pull up a recliner.

       "  '2016-10-27',\n",
       "  'Big media distributors such as AT&T, which owns DirecTV and delivers movies and TV shows to 100 million subscribers of its wireless, internet, and video services, have argued for years over which can best withstand the disruption brought about by online services like Netflix: Content providers? Or cable and satellite operators? With his surprise $85 billion takeover bid for Time Warner, Randall Stephenson, AT&T’s chief executive officer, is betting that the companies that will thrive in a world of streaming and smartphones must be both. “The future of mobile is video, and the future of video is mobile,” Stephenson said on Oct. 22 after announcing the deal.AT&T wants to offer programming wherever consumers wish—streamed to mobile phones or broadcast on TV. That’s why Stephenson is so hungry to own HBO, CNN, and other Time Warner content. Time Warner, which has a vast library of movies such as the Harry Potter films and TV series like Game of Thrones, is among Hollywood’s most prolific producers, with annual revenue of $28 billion.There’s more at play than a pay-TV operator hedging its bets. If Time Warner didn’t see a future for itself as a standalone content creator, analysts say, that’s a troubling sign for its fellow cable channel owners. AT&T’s move “is likely to force a number of other management teams to act, even if they do not recognize the need to do so yet,” says Barclays analyst Kannan Venkateshwar.Both companies are aggressively promoting the megadeal by touting its supposed benefits to others: Consumers will be able to get TV everywhere on all their mobile devices, they say, and producers and advertisers will have more data from online viewing to deliver relevant shows and targeted commercials. But AT&T also needs this deal to help itself. The number of U.S. consumers getting cable or satellite service peaked in 2012 and has declined since, so sticking with the industry’s business-as-usual is a risky option.Already, AT&T and Time Warner have separately been working to make it easier for consumers to watch more movies and TV shows online. On Oct. 25, AT&T set a price of $35 a month for a web-streaming TV service, DirecTV Now, that will include more than 100 channels when it debuts in November. Time Warner’s HBO last year rolled out an online version of its service for people who don’t pay for cable.It’s all part of an industry push to bulk up. Pay-TV distributors have been merging to increase their negotiating leverage over the price increases media companies have been charging for their content. Earlier this year, Charter Communications bought Time Warner Cable for $55 billion. Last year, AT&T bought DirecTV for $48 billion, creating the biggest U.S. pay-TV service.The AT&T-Time Warner takeover, if approved by the Federal Communications Commission and the Department of Justice, could trigger a rush of consolidation as media companies jockey for position in the new order. CBS and Viacom, both controlled by billionaire Sumner Redstone and his daughter, Shari, are considering recombining after more than a decade as separate companies. Walt Disney briefly considered buying Twitter, as Disney seeks fresh ways to distribute its channels like ESPN directly to consumers online. And smaller media companies such as AMC Networks, Discovery Communications, and Scripps Networks Interactive could look for partners so they can get bigger and maintain their ability to command higher fees for their channels from distributors.Some analysts are skeptical of AT&T’s rationale, pointing to Time Warner’s disastrous merger with America Online in 2000. Others argue that Comcast’s purchase of NBCUniversal in 2011 has demonstrated few clear synergies between the businesses. While Comcast’s Universal film studio just had its best year ever, its cable business has lost subscribers, and some of NBC’s networks have seen audience ratings fall. The doubters also see a potential culture clash between a massive phone company and one with a flashy Hollywood studio background.“It’s easy to say that this is the beginning of an M&A wave, but when you poke at it, the strategy here is pretty thin,” Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson, says of the AT&T-Time Warner plan. “Ultimately, it’s more about diversification than about creating competitive advantage. It’s hard to see why this would trigger any follow-on deals.”Already, politicians, other media companies, and consumer groups are lining up in opposition. Last year federal regulators blocked Comcast’s purchase of Time Warner Cable (spun off from Time Warner in 2009), arguing it would have concentrated too much power in a massive internet gatekeeper at a time when online video is trying to flourish. And in 2011 they blocked AT&T’s bid to buy wireless rival T-Mobile. Netflix, whose opinion carries weight with industry regulators who want to protect the burgeoning online video business, says it won’t oppose the takeover if AT&T treats all content equally and doesn’t give preference to Time Warner’s HBO.AT&T argues its acquisition isn’t monopolistic because it’s buying a supplier, not a competitor—akin to Comcast’s purchase of NBCUniversal, which gave it control of the NBC broadcast network and cable channels including USA Network. The government approved that deal, but forced Comcast to agree to certain conditions to protect the online video market. At the least, many expect similar restraints on an AT&T-Time Warner deal.While Wall Street remains skeptical the takeover will be approved, AT&T is making promises the regulators want to hear: It won’t get exclusive access to Time Warner’s content, it won’t interfere with CNN’s independent journalism, and it will boost competition in the cable and online advertising markets. “The markets are too pessimistic,” Stephenson said at a conference on Oct. 25. “I feel pretty good about this deal.” If he’s right, the argument over who’s king—those who make shows or those who distribute them—may no longer matter.The bottom line: AT&T’s $85 billion buyout of Time Warner will give it a huge content factory to supply traditional TV operators or new online services.'),\n",

       "  'The Mermaid Swimming in (Sand) DollarsLife as a mermaid isn’t always glamorous. “You have to tolerate chlorine and salt in your eyes and keep them open like it’s no problem,” says Linden Wolbert, a self-described “entrepremermaid” in Los Angeles. “There are times when I get out of the water and I can’t even see to drive home.” Wolbert also has to hold her breath for minutes at a time, smile without swallowing water, and swim in a silicone tail that weighs almost 50 pounds. (She usually has spotters.) Other than routine physical torture, being a mermaid for hire is “merrific” and “mermazing,” she says. She’s been one for more than a decade, working private events for celebrities such as Jessica Alba, Jessica Biel, and Justin Timberlake. Her “merformances”—events at which she swims mostly in pools, though sometimes in the ocean or at aquariums—start at $1,000, and she says she earns “more, hourly, for some projects than many lawyers I know.” Her YouTube channel brings in four figures a month.Linden WolbertHiring mermaids has been popular for years, as has pretending to be one. Lady Gaga, Kim and Khloe Kardashian, Britney Spears, Paris Hilton, and Katy Perry have all worn tails for costume balls, music videos, or publicity shoots. Their passion has helped inspire a “mertailing” industry to support aspiring sea maidens, and it’s thriving: In October, Walmart Stores ordered 58,000 of the Mermaid Linden kids’ monofins—flippers like the kind you use to snorkel but fused together—Wolbert makes with outfitters Body Glove International. Wolbert and Body Glove also teamed up to make a spandex children’s tail that’s patterned on a parrotfish. (The tail doesn’t come with any kind of flipper attached.) “We think it’s going to be incredibly successful,” says Body Glove President Russ Lesser.The larger mermaid economy is as diverse as sea life itself. Schools teach aspiring sea maidens in the Philippines, France, Spain, and the U.S. (In Omaha, a two-day class for adults costs $210; a two-day teacher-training class at New York’s Coney Island is $375.) The three photographers and “host” mermaid who run the Mermaid Portfolio Workshop charge as much as $3,000 to shoot would-be mermodels in the Bahamas and Isla Mujeres, Mexico. “The classes are internationally popular,” says Chris Crumley, one of the photographers.Wolbert’s spandex kids’ tail (right) resembles a\\u202fparrotfish; it’s meant to be sold with\\u202fher $29.99\\u202fmonofin.Mermaid Melissa (her legal name), in Orlando, says she’s built custom tanks and hired a school of mermaids to meet party demand. “Clients want something specific,” she says. “Like, ‘We want an African American mermaid. We want her in a gold tail.’\\u200a” And in Crystal River, Fla., Eric Ducharme, aka the Mertailor, says he sells thousands of tails annually, charging $120 for a stock version and as much as $5,000 for custom. (Thirty percent of his customers are male.) His tails appeared in this year’s The Nice Guys, with Ryan Gosling. “When movies come out, people get obsessed,” says Ducharme, 26. “It’s a sexual thing, but not in a perverted fetish way.” The obsession lives on: A live-action Little Mermaid and a Walt Disney remake of Splash with Channing Tatum as a merman are in the works.Wolbert, who’s in her 30s, has always been a strong swimmer. After majoring in film with a minor in environmental science at Emerson College in Boston, she traveled with the Professional Association of Diving Instructors as a scuba diving model. She learned to hold her breath for five minutes and to free dive, plunging to 115 feet without an oxygen tank. While filming a documentary in 2005, she found her calling. “I was watching divers swimming up and down wearing monofins, and they moved like mermaids,” she says. One day she borrowed one. “I jumped into the water and took off.”All she needed was a convincing tail. But back then, they weren’t available commercially. Luckily, her friend Allan Holt, who works in Hollywood in special effects, helped her make one out of silicone. Seven months and $20,000 later, her scuba diving and film friends began shooting videos, which she posted online. She started booking gigs.On a recent Friday, Wolbert sits poolside in Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif., preparing for a Body Glove photo shoot. She slathers her legs with hair conditioner to help ease into her blue tail. “Oils dissolve the silicone,” she says. Lesser’s 9-year-old granddaughter and two of her friends will arrive shortly to take part in the shoot, and Wolbert doesn’t want them to see her tailless. “It’s important not to break the illusion.”The collaboration with Body Glove began in 2013 after she met Lesser, a fellow board member for the Reef Check Foundation, a nonprofit focused on saving the ocean. He was impressed with her skills and passion. “She’s not just a mermaid, she’s a super athlete,” he says. “I met with Michael Phelps last year and challenged him to have a 100-yard swim [against Wolbert] from a standing start. He declined.”'),\n",

In Saban’s telling, it wasn’t a big deal. “I called and asked, ‘Are you going to go?’\\u2009” he says, recalling his conversation with Clinton. “He said, ‘Yeah, I’m going.’ I said, ‘I’m going, too.

President Barack Obama invited Clinton to ride back on Air Force One, which idled on the same tarmac as Saban’s jet. Saban channels Clinton looking back and forth between the two planes: “It was like, ‘Air Force One, Saban Air, Air Force One, Saban Air? OK, I’ll go with Air Force One!’\\u2009” Saban says he understood.Gossip about powerful friends, a lot of uncheckable dialogue, and a punchline—that’s typical Saban. The 72-year-old Israeli-American speaks five languages and is a gifted storyteller whose ability to entertain has helped him become an almost royal personage in Hollywood. “He’s one of the most charming people I have ever met in my whole life, and he’s really funny,” says reality TV star and entrepreneur Simon Cowell, with whom Saban developed Univision’s La Banda, an unscripted show about the search for the “ultimate” boy band and, more recently, girl band. Disney Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger, another of Saban’s friends, says, “He’s perceptive and perseverant. All that wealth that he created for himself, he did on his own.” Jeffrey Katzenberg, the former CEO of DreamWorks Animation, pays Saban the ultimate Hollywood compliment: “It’s easy to be charmed by Haim. But underneath that, there is just a laser-focused, razor-sharp, take-no-prisoners killer.”Saban and Cowell’s band quest.Saban, who’s worth $3.7 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, has two targets at the moment. He wants to take Univision public. He and a group of private equity investors bought the network for $12.3 billion in 2007, when it was a solely Spanish-language operation, and have transformed it into a bilingual platform aimed increasingly at young, multiethnic viewers.His other goal is to elect Hillary Clinton president. It’s something that Saban, a longtime defender of Israel whom the Jerusalem Post recently named the world’s No.\\u20091 “most influential Jew,” has been pushing since 2004. Last summer he told Bloomberg TV that he would give “as much as needed” to ensure her victory, and so far this election cycle he and his wife have donated $10 million to Clinton’s super PAC, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Saban gives Clinton his unsolicited advice, too. Recently, he told her to stop shouting on the stump. “I think that she has gotten the message from a couple of people,” he says. “You can see in the last few weeks that the shouting is gone.” Saban says he doesn’t see Clinton much these days, but on the rare occasions that they’re photographed together, they look like confidants.Saban’s two crusades are converging in a way that recalls previous windfalls in his career, when he made big, early bets that paid off in both money and clout. The conventional wisdom has been that Clinton can’t win without strong turnout from Hispanic voters, who helped Obama reach the White House twice. Saban’s company boasts that it is “the gateway to Hispanic America” in the U.S., reaching 40 million people in the demographic each month. Since June 2015, when Donald Trump announced his campaign with a pledge to build a wall along the Mexican border and deport millions of immigrants, some of whom he said were rapists, Univision has taken an adversarial stance. Nine days after Trump’s comments, the network canceled its plans to broadcast his Miss USA pageant. Trump filed a $500 million breach of contract lawsuit, alleging Saban was interfering to benefit Clinton. (The suit was settled confidentially.) The next month, Trump had Jorge Ramos, Univision’s leading news anchor, tossed out of a news conference in Iowa when Ramos questioned his immigration policies and ignored Trump’s command to “sit down” and “go back to Univision.” If many English-speaking Americans had until that point been only vaguely aware of Univision, they were now paying attention.Since then, Univision has co-hosted a Democratic primary debate, sought to register 3 million Latino voters, and promoted a mid-October concert along the U.S.-Mexican border called “RiseUp As One.” The network’s growing influence comes as Saban waits for the right moment to do the initial public offering—a process that has dragged on longer than expected and might play out more favorably under President-elect Clinton than under Trump. Saban says he has nothing to do with Univision’s news coverage, but some Republicans find this hard to believe. “He has been quoted as saying he will do everything in his power to get Hillary Clinton elected,” says Sean Spicer, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee. “I take him at his word.” On Oct. 10, WikiLeaks published hacked 2015 e-mails that show Saban persuading the Clinton campaign to make more of Trump’s anti-Hispanic rhetoric. In another message, on the subject of Univision’s perceived Clinton “boosterism,” Saban wrote: “i NEVER tell our news dep. what to cover.,,,unlike some of my peers.”Featured in Bloomberg Businessweek, Oct. 17-23, 2016. Subscribe now.Saban lives in one of the Los Angeles area’s exclusive gated communities, high in Beverly Hills, in a compound with a winding, pebbled driveway, sculpted shrubbery, fountains, and his baronial residence. On a recent afternoon, he sits at a long table in his home office sipping cappuccino and munching on a salty Middle Eastern pastry. Saban wears a slim-fitting black shirt, black pants, no socks, and black slip-on shoes with a vaguely aquatic look. His dark hair is slicked back and falls over his collar. The cream-colored walls are decorated with pictures of Saban with various world leaders. There’s also a poster from the classic Mel Brooks movie The Producers, with the quote “If you got it\\u2009…\\u2009flaunt it!”Like so many of Univision’s viewers, Saban, who speaks English with a heavy accent, has his own immigrant story. He was born in Egypt in 1944. When he was 12 years old, his family was forced to leave after President Gamal Abdel Nasser sought to rid the country of Jews. Saban and his family ended up living in one room next to a bus station in Tel Aviv. He served in the Israeli army, where he says he fought in two wars and was a garbage man and a disciplinarian. “I know,” he says, sitting in front of a large picture window through which you can see the late afternoon sun reddening the lush grounds outside. “You’re looking at me and thinking, ‘You were in charge of discipline?’ Yes, I was.” (It’s so not hard to believe.)While still in the military, Saban entered the music business. He talked a local band into jettisoning its bass player and took the position himself, even though he couldn’t really play. Saban sometimes performed with his amp turned off until his musicianship improved. In time, Saban became the band’s manager, taking them to London, where they signed with PolyGram Records. He bounced from Israel, where he managed more bands and learned about promotion, to Paris and then the U.S., where music production led him into the cartoon business. During a visit to Japan in 1984, he saw a spasmodic TV show featuring teen superheroes in candy-colored outfits. To American eyes, it might have looked at best like trash and at worst a seizure risk. “I thought it was brilliant,” Saban says. “Kids in Spandex battling rubber monsters? It sounds beautiful. It does. I mean, I loved it. What can I say? I don’t know why.”He wanted to bring a version of the show to the U.S. It would come to be titled Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. But when he showed it to the executives at his production company, they told him he was “deranged,” he recalls. “No, seriously,” he says. “They said, ‘Look, I mean, you’re doing so well. Why in the world would you take a risk of spoiling your reputation with this piece of crap?’\\u2009”“Deranged”: Power RangersSaban shopped the show around Hollywood for years until one day he hosted a meeting at his office with Margaret Loesch, then head of Fox Kids. She told Saban she needed a weekday morning show that would appeal to young boys. Loesch remembers Saban saying, “Just a moment, dalink.” Then, “he ran down the hall and came back waving a Power Rangers videocassette.” Loesch told Saban it was perfect.Saban and Loesch split the $100,000 cost of an 18-minute pilot, which they tested in Burbank with a group of children, each of whom was furnished with a dial. If the kids liked the show, they were supposed to turn the dial to the right. Turning the dial left would mean they hated it. “Guess what?” Saban says. “It was to the right the whole show.” He says Loesch told him she’d never seen anything like it in her 20-year career. Power Rangers became a hit when the show made its debut in 1993. Saban says Fox soon moved Power Rangers to the afternoons, where it boosted the ratings for the local news shows of the company’s affiliates that followed because so many were watching.Afterward, Saban says, News Corp. Chairman Rupert Murdoch wanted to buy his production company. “I said, ‘Bubbie, forget about it, I don’t need your money. Let’s create a partnership. You put in the network. I put in my content.’\\u2009” Murdoch, Saban says, told him he was out of his mind—but eventually came to see the appeal. Together they formed Fox Kids Worldwide, a company they hoped would compete with Viacom’s Nickelodeon and Time Warner’s Cartoon Network.The quickest way to get the network into a lot of homes would be to rebrand an existing channel. Saban targeted televangelist Pat Robertson’s Family Channel, the home of The 700 Club. Mel Woods, Saban’s chief operating officer at the time, recalls what transpired next. “Rupert Murdoch had a conversation with Pat Robertson,” Woods says. “The message came back to Haim: ‘They’re not interested.’ Chase Carey [then News Corp.’s co-COO] had a conversation—came back to Haim and said, ‘No, I don’t think they’re interested.’ Haim said, ‘Is it OK if I ask?’\\u2009” Saban and Carey went to dinner with Tim Robertson, the televangelist’s son. “During that dinner, I spoke as a member of the top Fox management, even though I wasn’t,” Saban says. “I said, ‘We’ll give you movies. We’ll give you television shows. We’ll open the vaults. And Chase Carey is sitting there thinking, ‘What the heck is he saying?’\\u2009”In the end, the Robertsons sold the Family Channel to Saban and Murdoch for $1.9 billion. “I said, ‘Hallelujah, praise the Lord,’\\u2009” Saban recalls.The new owners renamed their prize the Fox Family Channel. It never caught up to Nickelodeon, and in 2001, Saban and Murdoch decided to sell the network. Murdoch, a dealmaker of the first order, and his executives scoffed when Saban said it could sell for $5 billion. “They were kind of like, ‘Yeah, really? Good luck,’\\u2009” says former News Corp. President Peter Chernin. But the following year, at the annual Allen & Co. retreat in Sun Valley, Idaho, Saban persuaded then-Disney CEO Michael Eisner to make a bid.As Saban tells it, he brought Murdoch to the meeting and told him to sit quietly while Eisner made his offer. Instead, Murdoch started to laugh when Eisner said he was willing to pay $5.3 billion. Saban called for a break and took Murdoch aside. “I said, ‘What’s so funny about this?’ Rupert said, ‘He’s crazy. It’s not worth that.’ I said, ‘But you’re on the receiving end, so it’s not crazy.’\\u2009” Murdoch declined an interview request for this story. So did Eisner, who was widely thought to have overpaid for the network, which became ABC Family.As a billionaire, Saban has lavished money on causes and candidates, reaping the resulting friendships. Politically, he’s for Israel, abortion rights, and universal health care. In 2002 he and his wife, Cheryl, attended a presentation by Terry McAuliffe, then chairman of the Democratic National Committee, at the Clintons’ home in Washington. McAuliffe lamented that the Republican National Committee had much nicer headquarters than his organization’s. Saban says, “Cheryl bent over to me and said, ‘We’ve got to do something, and we’ve got to do it big.’\\u2009” Saban gave $7 million to fund a new building. (McAuliffe didn’t respond to an interview request.)The same year, Saban contacted Martin Indyk, the U.S. ambassador to Israel under Bill Clinton, and told him he wanted to start a think tank devoted to the Middle East. Indyk remembers the conversation well. “I said, ‘Well, you know, I already did that. I set up the Washington Institute for Near East Policy before I went into government, so why don’t you just give your money to them?’\\u2009” Indyk says. “Haim said, ‘No, you don’t understand. I want my own.’\\u2009” Indyk suggested that Saban establish his think tank at the Brookings Institution, a D.C. fixture for almost 90 years. Indyk recalls that Saban asked: “What’s Brookings?” That’s true, Saban says now, mocking himself. “Yeah, I didn’t know what Brookings was. Are you guys to the left? Are you to the right? Are you in the center? What are you? What do you do? I don’t know nothing.” He endowed Brookings’s Saban Center for Middle East Policy in May 2002. Its annual forum let its namesake rub shoulders with heads of state from America, Israel, and the Arab world. (It’s now called the Center for Middle East Policy.)Saban could easily afford it. In 2003 he and a group of investors won the bidding for ProSiebenSat.1 Media, a German TV company that Saban describes as the equivalent of a combined ABC, CBS, and CNN. Saban learned the deal had gone through while he and his family were touring Dachau, the Nazi death camp in Germany. “I’m standing in the crematorium, and the phone vibrates in my pocket,” he says. He stepped outside to take the call. Saban and his partners bought control of the company in a deal that valued it at $3 billion. Four years later, they flipped it in one worth $8 billion.In 2006, Saban testified before the U.S. Senate about how he, along with several other wealthy businessmen, used an offshore shelter to lower his taxes. He handled it as smoothly as everything else, pleading ignorance. “I am neither a lawyer nor a tax expert, in fact my formal education ended when I finished high school,” Saban said, adding that he was in the process of settling up with the IRS.Soon after, he and some of the same partners bought Univision. It was the most popular TV network among American Hispanics, the country’s fastest-growing ethnic group, who devoured the network’s prime-time telenovelas, soapy dramas often about life in rural Mexico. The shows were produced south of the border by Televisa, Mexico’s largest TV company. It was lucrative for Univision, which was buying content produced for pesos and collecting ad revenue in dollars.Univision also had a genuine bond with its audience, many of whom were new immigrants. Unlike many English-speaking viewers, who DVR’ed shows and bypassed ads, Hispanics tended to watch live. They also seemed to trust Univision more than the U.S. government. “They call us to find out where to send their kids to school, what the best hospitals are to send their kids if they get sick,” says Randy Falco, Univision’s CEO. “They’ve actually called us when their houses are on fire.”If the value of a Latino-focused media company seems obvious now, Saban gets credit for realizing it a decade ago. He was similarly ahead of the curve on the presidential prospects of Hillary Clinton, whom he encouraged to run in 2004. She demurred and then lost the Democratic primary in 2008 to Obama. Saban was devastated, refusing to write Obama checks for the general election. “It took me a couple of years to heal, because I was so passionate about Hillary,” he says.Things weren’t going much better at Univision. When the financial crisis struck in 2008, advertising revenue plummeted, and Univision took a $3.7 billion write-down that year. Meanwhile, Televisa, its main programming supplier, believed it had been historically underpaid by Univision and had gone to court to sever ties. Saban persuaded Televisa CEO Emilio Azcárraga Jean not only to extend his company’s programming agreement with Univision until 2020, he also got Televisa to contribute a much needed $1.2 billion in exchange for 5 percent of the company. “Haim Saban is one of the toughest and most persistent negotiators I have met,” Azcárraga said in a statement. And like so many others, he came away smitten, extolling Saban’s charisma and “great sense of humor.\\u2009…\\u2009We not only became partners, but also great friends,” he said.Saban spent the next few years overseeing his company’s expansion. Univision created cable stations such as Univision Deportes (sports) and Univision TLnovelas (all-telenovelas-all-the-time). In 2013, Univision announced a venture with Disney to create Fusion, a cable network for young English-speaking Hispanics. Univision would provide the programs, and Disney would handle ad sales and get the network into major cable companies’ listings. But Fusion’s premise was flawed. In focus groups, young Hispanics said they “didn’t want to be treated as a tribe,” says Isaac Lee, Univision’s chief news, entertainment, and digital officer who oversees Fusion. “They also didn’t want to consume content that was only about Hispanic things.” Univision shifted Fusion’s target audience to what it describes as “multicultural millennials.” Disney pulled out of the venture last year. Fusion, which lost $64 million in its first three years, has yet to be picked up by Comcast, America’s largest cable operator.Prime Time: El Hotel de los SecretosUnivision was also losing its own touch with programming. Its average prime-time viewership tumbled from 3.6 million people in the 2012-13 season to 2 million three years later, according to Nielsen, as its audience tired of Televisa’s pastoral fare. “I don’t want to see a novela with a hacienda,” says Lisa Torres, head of ad agency Publicis Media’s multicultural division. “I don’t know what a hacienda is. I have never been on a hacienda. I don’t know how to raise horses. That’s not my lifestyle.” Spokespeople for Univision and Televisa say their top executives met in Mexico City on Oct. 4 to discuss how to make better shows.Saban has used acquisitions to bolster the Internet audience of the Fusion Media Group, recently formed to run the company’s newer TV and web ventures. Last year, Univision purchased The Root, a website aimed at African American audiences co-founded by Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates. In January it bought the Onion’s satirical empire. And in August it won an auction for Gawker Media, whose flagship website was known for scabrous takedowns, one of which led to a courtroom loss and bankruptcy. Gawker founder Nick Denton says he’s pleased Univision has picked up the remnants of his company. “Hipsters and Hispanics,” he says. “Two of the fastest-growing demographics in the U.S.”Lee says Univision plans to create TV shows around its recently acquired websites. “At the end, it’ll be all of them, but we have to start with the most important,” he says. “There’s a Gawker property called Kotaku. It’s about gaming. The fandom in the Hispanic community about gaming is crazy.” He says the more Fusion can deliver an audience of young African Americans, Hispanics, and other groups, the better chance it has of pressuring Comcast into carrying Fusion.Not everybody believes Univision’s strategy to court millennials regardless of language will pay off. Some analysts suspect that Saban is just trying to pretty up the profitable but heavily indebted Univision for the IPO. “They did it to get a higher [price] multiple,” says Harold Vogel, a New York-based media analyst. “It was going to make them cool and sassy and, you know, attractive to the market. And I’m saying, wait a minute, there’s nothing there.”If Saban and his partners do take Univision public—the company notified the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission of its intent a year ago but hasn’t yet set a date—they may already have a buyer for a significant block of shares. Last year, Univision disclosed that it had a plan to enable Televisa, which now owns almost 10 percent of the company, to increase its position to as much as 40 percent. But that would require the approval of the Federal Communications Commission, which must review any proposal to raise foreign ownership of a U.S. broadcast company beyond 25 percent. To pull this off, Saban needs a supportive administration in Washington. “Hillary is more likely to bless any expansion of foreign ownership between the two than Trump is,” says veteran media analyst Porter Bibb. “If Trump should win, Jorge Ramos really is dead in the water. I think Trump would probably figure out a way to ban him from the airwaves.”Anchor—and Trump antagonist—Ramos.It’s hard to overstate the influence of Univision’s top news anchor in the Hispanic community. Years ago, English-language networks had iconic news anchors such as Walter Cronkite and David Brinkley, whose Olympian utterances swayed millions. Their modern counterparts aren’t nearly as powerful, but in the world of Hispanic media where so many people still watch broadcast television, it’s different. “Jorge Ramos is one of our most beloved journalists,” says Torres of Publicis Media. “I mean, he is our Walter Cronkite.”Ramos, whose daughter works for the Clinton campaign, says he’s just a journalist asking tough questions, but he’s a crusader on matters like immigration. “If you have a candidate like Donald Trump who made racist remarks about Mexican immigrants, we cannot stay silent, impassive as journalists,” he says. “We saw a couple of weeks ago that the L.A. Times, Washington Post, New York Times, and Politico decided to call Donald Trump a liar,” he says. “But we did it in August of 2015.”In a recent column in Time, Ramos warned that anybody who doesn’t take a strong stand against Trump’s transgressions will be judged in the future for being on the wrong side of history. But what Ramos sees as principle, others see as evidence that he can no longer report the news objectively. “The problem with him is that he doesn’t realize that if you’re a hard news reporter, you cannot give opinion,” says Alfonso Aguilar, head of the Latino Partnership for Conservative Principles in Washington and a political analyst for Univision’s chief rival, Telemundo. “He has a right to give us his opinion, but he can’t be the anchor and provide hard news. Because you are biased.”Jorge Bonilla, a contributing writer at MRC Latino, a conservative watchdog group that tracks what it perceives to be liberal leanings in Spanish-language media, says he considers Ramos just one part of a broader problem at Univision. “When you look at the softball interviews that have been given to Hillary Clinton over the last couple of years and Haim Saban’s public statements, it is very evident that the network is committed to the election of Hillary Clinton,” Bonilla says.That’s not true, says Saban. He notes that he was in the front row at a Democratic primary debate in March that Ramos moderated. The anchor’s first question to Clinton: “Would you drop out of the race if you get indicted?” Saban winces at the memory. “I’m thinking to myself, Could it be the second question, the third question? Why the first question?” he says. “For crying out loud! I had a friend with me. He said, ‘I thought you were supportive of Hillary.’ I said, ‘I am supportive of Hillary, but I don’t tell this guy [Ramos] what to say. You know, he says what he wants to say.’\\u2009”Election forecasting models give Clinton more than an 80 percent chance of winning the White House. It might be the right time for Unvision to go public, too. “The stock market is very buoyant, and the prognosis for the next 12 months is pretty strong,” says media analyst Bibb. “If I was Saban, I’d pop that thing right now.”At his Beverly Hills home, Saban says he’s not looking for anything if Clinton is elected—not even a chance to be a back channel between the White House and the Israeli government, as some have speculated. “I will tell you exactly what I want,” he says. “And no one in the world, be it the president of the United States or the prime minister of Israel or whomever, can give me that. Only I can give me that. I just want to be Haim Saban. That’s all. I don’t want to change anything in my life.”'),\n",

       "  'Inside an art deco building on the edge of London’s Soho district are hundreds of programmers and graphic designers working on Rogue One, the Star Wars spinoff film due out in December. As you enter, a large photograph of kids playing in Darth Vader and Stormtrooper masks is the only obvious hint that this is the London outpost of Industrial Light & Magic, the visual-effects company founded by George Lucas and now owned by Walt Disney. Based in San Francisco, ILM opened the London office at the end of 2014, hoping to tap into the city’s growing band of digital artists as it prepared to tackle effects for a new Star Wars trilogy.The U.K. has produced three of the world’s five biggest visual-effects companies, turning London into a global hub for film production. Its status recently got an unexpected boost: The 10 percent drop in the pound after the U.K. voted to leave the European Union has made it even cheaper for Hollywood studios to outsource film production to London. “There’s a lot more interest now in moving work to the U.K.,” says Sue Lyster, the executive in charge of production at ILM London, which employs more than 300 people.The British government first introduced tax breaks for film production in 1997. Two years ago, it made the incentives more generous: Any film with at least 10 percent of its production in the U.K. gets a 25 percent cash rebate on the amount it spends there, capping out at 80 percent of a film’s budget. Brexit could make that deal even sweeter. EU rules against state aid forced the government to cap tax credits at 80 percent. If the U.K. leaves the single market, the government could extend the break to 100 percent of film production costs if it wants.Britain’s three leading visual-effects houses—Double Negative, Framestore, and Moving Picture—are centered around Soho, London’s cramped creative heartland. Together they employ more than 5,000 people globally and generate an estimated £250 million ($332 million) of annual revenue. U.K.-based production houses have won the last three Oscars for best visual effects—for 2013’s Gravity, 2014’s Interstellar, and 2015’s Ex Machina.For The Martian, Framestore turned Matt Damon’s performance before a studio green screen into a harrowing scene above the Red Planet.Even before the pound’s recent slide, London-based houses had amped up this summer’s biggest blockbusters. Double Negative, which won an Oscar in 2011 for Inception and in 2014 for Interstellar, labored over the wild Las Vegas car chase scene in the latest Jason Bourne installment while also reimagining the Enterprise in Star Trek Beyond. Framestore perfected the jungle and gorillas in The Legend of Tarzan. And Moving Picture is already generating Oscar nomination buzz for its work on Disney’s update of The Jungle Book, which filmed the Mowgli tale entirely in a computer-generated world without any outdoor locations.Hollywood’s reliance on mega-spectacles has made the green screen central to today’s moviemaking. The top-10 box-office list of 2016 is dominated by films with heavy visual effects. Digital artists can do everything from removing a crane from a sloppily filmed scene to designing a 10-shot action sequence that can cost upwards of $10 million for visual effects alone.Computer-generated imagery accounts for about a third of the cost of the average $100 million-plus blockbuster, double what it was a decade ago, according to William Sargent, co-founder of Framestore, London’s oldest visual-effects house. “The nature of filmmaking has changed over the past 5 to 10 years, and it’s accelerating as directors mix and match physical and digital,” Sargent says. “Our market is growing, because the computer-generated component is going up.”Tax breaks have enabled British houses to undercut U.S. rivals on price. As a result, many of the leading Hollywood visual-effects companies have struggled. In 2013, Rhythm & Hues Studios, based in Los Angeles, filed for bankruptcy after 25 years in business. Eleven days later, it won an Oscar for best visual effects for Life of Pi.It was British author J.K. Rowling’s works that ignited London’s visual-effects industry. The eight Harry Potter films generated a steady stream of work for U.K. companies, allowing them to expand. “Over eight years, the whole industry shifted from the West Coast of the U.S. to London,” says Tim Burke, the visual-effects supervisor on Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, a Potter spinoff that will be released by Warner Bros. in November. All three of the big London effects houses are creating computer-generated creatures for the film.Before the Brexit-induced drop in the pound, Canada had been stealing work from the U.K. with even bigger tax breaks. Vancouver reduced its tax breaks in May, but studios can still get a mix of provincial, federal, and visual-effects credits covering 53 percent of labor costs if they shift work to the city. Montreal’s tax incentives are even more generous.Those benefits have led London’s visual-effects companies to set up Canadian offshoots. In 2013, Framestore opened an office in Montreal, where it now employs 350 people. The following year, Double Negative sold itself to India’s Prime Focus World to get the cash to expand to Vancouver, where it has 450 staffers. “We were missing out on work, because it was being done in Vancouver,” says Alex Hope, co-founder of Double Negative. “To stay competitive, we wanted to expand both in the U.K. and Canada.”While the pound’s slump may put a brake on work drifting to Canada, ILM’s Lyster is worried about the ability to hire junior talent to feed the industry if the U.K. imposes visa requirements on EU citizens. Senior visual-effects artists would easily pass a skills and income test for U.K. work permits, while new graduates from Europe may not. Still, until Brexit becomes a reality—which could take years—Hollywood will likely be looking at London as a bargain.The bottom line: The British pound’s post-Brexit drop has made London-based visual-effects houses even more attractive to Hollywood.'),\n",

       "  \"LeeThe following is a condensed and edited interview with Stan Lee, chairman emeritus, Marvel Entertainment.\\n \\nYou went into the comics business when you were 17. How did that happen?\\nI heard there was an opening in this publishing company. I didn’t know it was in the comic book department. They published movie books, sports books, romance books, and a few comics. It was only a two-man department, Joe Simon and Jack Kirby, who worked as a team.\\n \\nI filled the inkwells. In those days, they used ink, and that’s how I started. Little by little, I would read some of the things, and I would say, “You know, that’s a mistake. It ought to be worded this way.” So they’d let me change the wording. Before I knew it, I was writing some stories for them.\\n \\nWhat was the inspiration for Spider-Man?\\nFirst of all, I wanted him to be a teenager, because there were no teenager heroes. Then I wanted him to have personal problems. He didn’t have enough money. Nobody ever asked if super\\xadheroes had money or didn’t. But this guy, he lived with his aunt who had no money. He had to help pay the rent and so forth.\\n \\nI wanted each character to be interesting, so that the reader would care. Each had to have his or her own personality, his or her own hang-ups and quirks and problems. I thought of them as actors.\\n \\nSteven Spielberg met me at a party, and we were talking. He said, “You know, Stan, you and I do essentially the same thing, except my pictures move.” I thought that was kind of nice of him to say.\\n \\nWhy do you think it took so long for Hollywood to get Marvel movies right?\\nThe film studios, they just didn’t see it until finally Disney did. Disney has done a wonderful job. I mean, they’ve made these characters the biggest things in the world. They’ve made me seem better than I am by making the movies so good.\\n \\nYou’ve done cameos in all the movies. Is there any particular role that you've liked the best?\\nMy favorite was the one, Avengers: Age of Ultron, where Thor warned me not to take a drink and I did anyway, and then the next scene I was dead drunk. They were carrying me out. [Laughs]\\n \\nYou didn't like playing the disc jockey in the strip club in Deadpool?\\nOh, I loved that, except they didn't shoot that in the strip club; very frustrating.\\n \\nWhat was the message you were trying to send with the X-Men?\\nIt was an anti-bigotry story. People hated and feared the X-Men because they were different. And I wanted to show that everybody is different in some way or other, and it's wrong to hate somebody because of the difference.\\n \\nWhat’s the worst advice you ever got?\\nListen to what your boss tells you. My boss never liked the idea of Spider-Man. He didn’t want to do it. I had to sneak Spider-Man into another book, over my boss’s head. Experts really know nothing. \"),\n",

       "  'VestagerThe following is a condensed and edited interview with Margrethe Vestager, European commissioner for competition. \\nWhy are U.S. technology companies getting so much scrutiny from you?\\nIt goes for every industry, not only the tech industry. Just as we would congratulate any business while they grow and flourish and invent new things, if we see that they start to misuse their size and power to prevent others from growing and flourishing and investing in new things, then you have an issue with us.\\n \\nCan companies gain an unfair advantage over competitors based on the data they hold?\\nIt depends. If you merge two businesses, and by merging the sets of data it becomes de facto impossible for somebody to enter that business space, then you have an issue. We haven’t had those concerns yet, but we’re very much concerned that they will occur.\\n \\nThere’s an implicit contract with internet services. A person hands over data in exchange for the service. Is the collection of people’s data an area that deserves more government regulation?\\nIt deserves a lot more attention, for people to realize that as always there is no such thing as a free lunch. There is no such thing as a free app. Obviously, you pay. And now you pay with your data.\\n \\nThe problem when it comes to paying with data is, it’s very hard to see what the exchange rate is. The reason I don’t use loyalty cards is that I find the exchange rate is very bad for me, because they get all my data—they know what I buy, they can figure out the age of my children, if I entertain guests, etc. But what I get is maybe a discount on washing powder that I don’t even want to buy. Why would I want that? Or I get customized shopping, which in my opinion limits my focus of attention, because maybe I would like to try something different than what an algorithm would suggest.\\n \\nGoogle has been the subject of intense scrutiny by the European Commission. What would you like to see the company do differently?\\nWe only open a case if we have strong evidence that a company is misusing its dominant position—that Google is promoting itself in neighboring markets [such as shopping] and not applying the same penalties [in its search rankings] to its products that it does to its competitors’ in those neighboring markets. From my point of view, I want the competitors to have a fair chance of making it. If you can’t present your innovations to customers, why innovate?\\n \\nWhat if the competitors’ products just aren’t as good? People don’t seem to have a problem with Google’s quality.\\nThat’s not the question. You don’t know if someone can come up with something better. Just because something is good doesn’t mean it’s the end of innovation. If it was, well then, we’d still be in horse carriages.\\n \\nBut isn’t there a choice? You’re investigating Google because people need to sign up for its services when they use Android. Can’t somebody download another search or e-mail app for their phone?\\nIf everything is presented to you, then your impetus to look for something new is so much smaller. Android is a very good operating system—open source. But how Android is used seems to place customers in a lot of instances on a one-way Google Street. That’s because you want an out-of-the-box experience, and even before you start thinking there is something else, you’re in a 100 percent Google experience. \\nThere’s a fresh generation of technology firms that have quickly become dominant in new markets. Uber in particular has raised record amounts of money, and it’s been accused of unfair business practices.\\nNot only have they raised a lot of money, but they have raised a lot of hostility. You can hardly find a European member state where there is not a lawsuit. What we have been trying to do from the European Commission side is to say it is very important to have a market that’s open to new ways of doing business, but it’s completely legitimate to have demands on those new businesses—taxation and consumer protections, maybe social issues of working, environment—that are in line with the European way of thinking.\\n \\nIs Uber, or are others such as Airbnb, acting anti-competitively?\\nNot necessarily. The complaints the commission has received have been more from labor unions and people who worry about whether taxes are being paid. It’s no surprise either that in some markets they cause hostility, because it’s an obvious threat to people’s jobs. That, of course, is not necessarily a competition law enforcement issue. It’s an issue in the marketplace and, sometimes, an issue for the regulator, to make sure we have a level playing field.\\n \\nYou’re fairly active on Twitter. Do you attract the hostility and the trolling many women experience?\\nYes, but it seems to be much harder to be really angry in just 140 characters. I like Twitter much more than Facebook. For me it’s a personal challenge, because I tend to talk a lot—so to be confined to 140 characters is a challenge.\\n \\nAs you’ve investigated the technology sector, have you changed how you use the internet?\\nI’ve become slightly more obsessed with data security and much more reluctant to give away my data.'),\n",

       "  'Mini taste arbiters select favorites at Target’s head office.Marquan Harper arrived at the Minneapolis head office of Target dressed as if he were coming to work. The St. Paul 10-year-old had approximated the store uniform—a red shirt and khaki pants—and persuaded his mom to do the same. He checked in at reception, put on his lanyard, and joined 16 other kids to weigh in on a new line of children’s and babies’ clothes called Cat & Jack.The group, demographically correct and temperamentally diverse, piled into Room 445, transformed for the day into a giant walk-in closet the kids could ransack. They styled one headless, child-size mannequin in a striped neon dress and brown suede boots and another in blue leggings, blue suede boots, and a gray T-shirt that read “Inventor.” With its playful layers, boho-chic cuts, and muted shades juxtaposed with hits of neon, Cat & Jack looks a lot like Crewcuts, J.Crew’s adventurous line for young fashion plates (or their aspirational parents). New for Target is a focus on graphic T-shirts with feel-good contemporary slogans such as “Change the World by Being You.”Marquan says he’s mostly outgrown graphic tees, though he might wear one when he records gaming videos for his YouTube channel, as long as the shirt doesn’t seem braggy. Finnegan Wambay, also 10 and from Chicago, is more receptive: “My favorite T-shirt here is ‘Periodically Genius, But Always Cool,’\\u200a” he says. “I would wear that every day.” Featured in Bloomberg Businessweek, July 11 - 17, 2016. Subscribe nowAnybody who’s been around young families knows that parents solicit their kids’ opinions about all kinds of once-adult decisions: where to go for dinner, what kind of car to buy, even what to wear. In keeping with the times, Target’s designers have been listening to kids, too, about 1,000 of them from the ages of 4 to 12—in their homes, online, at daylong fairs, and in focus groups—to create what could become one of the company’s biggest brands and maybe one of the country’s biggest kids’ brands.For two decades, Target’s two mainstay kids’ labels were Cherokee and Circo. These togs were noteworthy for their ordinariness, as easy to throw in the shopping cart as granola bars or juice boxes, and for how consistently they sold, accounting for roughly a billion dollars a year in sales. Now, Target is taking what amounts to a great leap of faith for a lumbering, 1,800-store retailer: throwing out what’s worked and opening its sales to the winds of trends and the whims of children.Cat & Jack is a crucial step in a long-term plan to revitalize Target, the second-largest discount retailer in the U.S. Executives are funneling their attention and resources into four broad areas—babies, kids, style, and wellness. These signature categories, as they call them, account for $25 billion in annual sales, one-third of the company total, and have higher margins than essentials such as groceries and appliances. Once reimagined, these areas are expected to generate sales that will grow two to three times faster than the store’s other staples.When Cat & Jack replaces Circo and Cherokee in mid-July, Target executives will need these (somewhat) groovier cuts and colors to continue to appeal to already satisfied customers. They’re also betting that sales will increase at twice the rate of children’s lines at such competitors as Walmart Stores, Kohl’s, the Children’s Place, and Old Navy. But enthusiasm for Cat & Jack goes deeper than the bottom line. Target has thrown money, time, and reams of research into tutu dresses and dancing robot shirts because the company’s future is supposed to look the way Cat & Jack is supposed to look: optimistic, modern, wholesome, inclusive, fun. That’s a lot like what people thought of Target before it lost its cool. For years, Target had pulled off a feat that made it the envy of retailers and “Tar-zhay” to its customers. It sold high design at low prices and gave big-box shopping some luster. Remember? In 1999 the architect Michael Graves introduced his witty postmodernism to the masses there. His stainless-steel teapots capped with a whistling bird for Alessi usually sold for $100; Target’s version, with an actual whistle in lieu of a bird, went for $39.99. Isaac Mizrahi designed clothes not only for Bergdorf Goodman, but also for Target. Long before H&M, Target galvanized the designer collaboration craze, selling limited-edition collections from Jason Wu, Rodarte, Proenza Schouler, and Missoni. To draw in high-minded and deeper-pocketed shoppers, it bought up all the ads in an issue of the New Yorker. In 2005 it staged a fashion show in New York where gymnasts rappelled down the face of 30 Rockefeller Center. The chain’s mascot, Bullseye, an English bull terrier, is in Madame Tussauds wax museum.Target came into being in 1962, the same year as Walmart and Kmart. Walmart claimed global domination, Kmart puttered along, and Target became the standard-bearer for cheap chic. Its clever marketing campaigns—“Hello Good Buy,” a Beatles song remake, is one of the most memorable—made people feel better about shopping there instead of Walmart for essentials, even if the products sometimes cost more. Necessities, such as Method, the minimalist housecleaning products that distinguish Target’s fluorescent-lit shelves from its competitors’, account for almost half of its revenue. “Target was the world’s best-merchandised discount store,” says Howard Davidowitz, who runs a retail consulting firm in New York.As consumers traded down during the recession, Target did too. It focused on lower-priced, lower-quality goods rather than the high-concept clothes, teapots, and garlic presses it was known for. That decision brought it more directly in competition with Walmart, dollar stores, and Amazon.com. Trying to out-cheap them in a low-margin business proved a losing proposition.In 2008 sales at existing stores fell 2.9 percent for the year, the first decline in at least three decades. After another bad year, sales slowly improved until December 2013, when news surfaced that hackers had stolen the credit card or personal information of some 70 million customers. Holiday profit was almost halved, and the breach eventually cost the retailer $200 million and singed its faltering reputation. That same year the company ventured outside the U.S. for the first time, opening stores in Canada at second-rate locations vacated by a failed discounter and stocking them with merchandise priced higher than in its U.S. stores. Huffington Post Canada reported to resentful locals that, for example, a set of two Riedel Vivant Pinot Noir Tumblers sold for C$24.99 (about $24 in 2013) but were listed at $19.99 on Target’s U.S. website. Then, a new distribution system introduced there broke down, leaving warehouses full and shelves empty.The situation had become desperate enough that the board of directors hired the first outsider to run Target in its 52-year history. When Brian Cornell, formerly a senior executive at PepsiCo and head of Sam’s Club, became chief executive officer in August 2014, his first major decision was to shut down the Canadian operation; the company took a $5.4 billion writedown. (Former CEO Gregg Steinhafel had told Women’s Wear Daily in June 2012 that he expected “Target Canada to deliver $6 billion or more in sales and 80¢ or more in earnings per share by 2017.”)Perhaps the biggest issue was that under Steinhafel, the once groundbreaking retailer had become bureaucratic and insular while the industry had become hypercompetitive. Target didn’t take online shopping seriously, missing out on the emergence of the millennial shopper and the mighty swing to e-commerce. Amy Koo, an analyst at Kantar Retail, says the percentage of U.S. families at the end of 2007 who had shopped at a Target within the past month was 53.2 percent, vs. 31 percent in May.Executives say they’re through the worst and agree on how to talk about the dark years. They start with their slogan “Expect More. Pay Less.” “We pulled back on the ‘expect more’ and focused on the ‘pay less,’\\u200a” Cornell says. “As soon as we uncouple that idea, we’re no longer Target,” says Jeff Jones, the chief marketing officer. “There are lots of places where you can pay less and lots where you can expect more.” Target had become neither.“We had lost some of our edge,” Cornell says. “We had to modernize.” Target also had to downsize: It’s let go 2,600 people and eliminated an additional 1,400 open positions, reducing its staff at headquarters by 30 percent. Of Cornell’s 12 senior executives, nine are new to the company or to their job.Cornell is trim and compact, holds an iPad on his lap, and wears a crisp, blue-checked shirt and blue suit pants, an outfit that would’ve violated the previous coat-and-tie executive dress code. Target was always a more conventional company than its savvy design and ad campaigns suggested. These days, everyone at the office can wear jeans and T-shirts.Cornell likes to give interviews on the 26th floor, a bright, airy space where the design team displays its favorite products, such as a marble tea-candle holder and a bedsheet with a pocket for a mobile phone. He roams around, eats at the company cafe, and sometimes conducts impromptu in-store focus groups. He regularly invites executives from modish tech companies such as Pinterest and Snapchat to give talks.In meetings early on, Cornell says, he had to encourage “more conversation, fewer slides.” He asked staff to call out problems in areas other than their own. “It is sometimes uncomfortable. We’re a Midwestern company. We didn’t say the hard things before,” says Joshua Thomas, a spokesman.Consider that until two years ago Target didn’t use mannequins or that until this year it didn’t have visual merchandisers, the group of creatives devoted to store displays. Executives didn’t think they needed either. Even when they were at their best, Target’s stores never quite lived up to the expectations of those coming for the designer “collabo” products which were often sitting forlornly between plastic tumblers and jumbo pretzel bags. The thrifty approach served to keep budget-minded customers from feeling alienated, but now that Whole Foods Market makes even lettuce look lush and H&M has introduced the velvet rope to discounters, Target has to step up.Executives are pleased to report that clothes displayed on mannequins sell 30 percent more than when they’re on racks or shelves. Even in downtown Brooklyn at Target’s busiest, and often messiest, store, the mannequins are dressed neatly in red, white, and blue before the July 4 holiday. One is wearing a Cherokee red tulle miniskirt, a navy vest with ice pops, and a navy T-shirt. Another has stars-and-stripes leggings and a blue T-shirt emblazoned with a map of America. Although the rest of the girls’ department is subjected to fluorescent lighting, there’s track lighting above the mannequins. It helps.Target is also redesigning the front area of its stores, aka the Bullseye Playground. Before, shelves there looked like bargain bins—with three-ring binders, socks, math flash cards, jute twine, and marshmallow skewers jumbled together—although bargain bins that brought in more than half a billion dollars a year. Most items are still less than $7, but the shelves are streamlined and cheerier. In one Minneapolis store in late May, LED string lights, candles, American flags, paper lanterns, tote bags, and seed kits are lined up in their proper spots, their prices easy to see. Sales have increased 30 percent.Target’s typical customer is changing, too. Executives used to describe her (always her) as a boomer mom who drives a minivan and lives in the suburbs. Now, Target says it has more Hispanic, millennial, and urban shoppers. Which is why it ran ads featuring Hispanic celebrities during the Billboard Latin Music Awards, created its Cartwheel app to offer special deals, and plans to open two stores in New York City this year.All families shop for kids’ clothes, though, making it one of the most reliable categories for retailers. It’s a $30 billion market in the U.S. that grew 1.8 percent last year, split among such companies as Children’s Place, Gap, Gymboree, H&M, Kohl’s, Walmart, Zara, and many small boutiques, some online only, according to Euromonitor International. “The good thing about the kids’ business is that it is a little more stable” than women’s and menswear, says Susan Anderson, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets. Because growth in the kids’ clothing business is modest, “it’s really just a battle for market share,” she says. Target is second to Walmart among the mass merchants, which together account for about 40 percent of children’s apparel sales, according to market researcher NPD Group.   Amanda Nusz is Target’s head merchant for kids’ clothes and Nadine Steklenski is head designer. They’ve worked together for almost 10 years and really do finish each other’s sentences. Whatever tension exists between them as they balance taking risks and making the numbers, they’re equally adept at hiding it. They’re both energetic, though Steklenski, in a tight black dress with a faux-leopard coat and a big, turquoise necklace, is the more boisterous. Nusz wears a white lacy shirt from Adam Lippes for Target and pants from Target’s Merona brand. While everyone else labors in typical cubical farms, the 270 designers work in an open space with art studios, glass-walled showrooms, lots of natural light, and even two balconies where they can enjoy the brief Minneapolis summer.Nusz and Steklenski say they’d been eager to try something different for kids but could never persuade Steinhafel to back them. Early on, Cornell said he wanted Target to be “famous for kids.” Nusz and Steklenski argued for scrapping Circo, the in-house kids’ brand; ending the licensing agreement with Cherokee, which Target designs; and creating a line for newborns to preteens. “That was a big decision, because Circo and Cherokee were successful,” says Julie Guggemos, head of product design and development, who’s been at Target for almost 26 years. “The kids’ business wasn’t broken. It was strong.” It was sort of invisible, though, and hadn’t evolved much from the look of the Olsen twins on Full House. “If you only put hearts and flowers in an assortment for girls and it sells, you think that’s all they want,” Guggemos says. “Girls love science. People know that, but that unfortunately wasn’t the take we had.”Last year, Target stopped separating toys into boys’ and girls’ aisles. This year it announced that transgender customers could use the bathroom of their choice. Cat & Jack isn’t gender-neutral, but there will be an online-only collection of shirts under the name, Tees for All, with words like “Athlete” or “Smart & Strong” available for boys and girls in a unisex fit. Clothes in the stores will remain separated by gender. Cat & Jack will still offer sparkles and glitter, pink and purple, frills and ruffles, and, at least at some point, kid-size butterfly wings and a long tulle skirt with glow-in-the-dark stars. The prints on Cat & Jack dresses won’t be wildly different from what’s been in stores, but they’ll be more sophisticated, the color combinations less typical. The polka dots will be bigger, the stripes neon. There will be a short-sleeve dress with boldly drawn flowers and leaves on a black background; another dress will have a pale pink sweatshirt on top and an orange tulle skirt. Boys will still get dinosaurs and astronauts on their T-shirts and slouchy pants with drawstring waists.Cat & Jack is geared for a generation of kids that’s more collaborative than competitive. “They’re not about positivity that makes themselves feel good but someone else feel bad,” says Mandy Daneman, who conducts research for Target. She and her team interviewed hundreds of kids, dug into academic studies, and talked with companies such as Walt Disney and Nickelodeon. “The kids told us: I don’t want shirts that say, ‘I Win, You Lose.’ I want shirts that say, ‘We Got This,’ or, ‘Game On.’\\u200a” The team changed a shirt from “Play to Win” to “Play for Fun.”Nusz and Steklenski noticed that kids have a finely developed and widely shared sense of humor. “Now it’s cool to be the funny one,” Nusz says. Especially for boys, says Steklenski. “I see boys walk around with unicorns on their shirts—if there are butterflies coming out of the butt.”“We’re not in the self-esteem business, but we are in the self-expression business,” Nusz says. Adds Daneman: “The kids are saying, ‘I want to stand out in my pack.’ Think about it. That means ‘I want to be unique but not unique enough that I don’t have a place.’\\u200a”Target listens, to a point. Kids change their minds, and parents ultimately pay. That’s why although 10-year-old Finnegan loved the “Periodically Genius, But Always Cool” graphic, the designers changed it, because they mostly heard that kids care more about being smart than cool. Now it’s simply “Genius” written with elements from the periodic table.When one group of parents and kids saw a boys’ T-shirt with the saying, “Lost in Space—No Wifi Out Here,” the adults thought it was funny and the kids thought that seemed like a very scary place. Nusz decided to keep the shirt in the collection. Then there was the tee with camouflage made of kale. It was a favorite of the designers, but no one else cared for it. The most polarizing shirt said simply, “OMG.” The kids loved it, but “parents don’t really want sass on the T-shirt when they are already dealing with it at home,” Nusz says. They cut it. “If it was going to be our No.\\u20091 seller, we’d have to think about it.”Target’s design staff used to browse competitors for inspiration. Now, Steklenski says, “I don’t want a derivative of a derivative. Don’t go to Topshop, go to Morocco,” the country that’s the source of the djellaba chic swirling through the pages of Vogue. They went. They drew pictures of the mosaic tiles to create patterns for some of the dresses. They also traveled to Bali to visit the Green School, which says it’s the world’s only completely sustainable school. When talking to the kids about social issues, Target’s merchants and designers thought hunger or homelessness among children would come up. Instead, the kids talked about saving animals. Afterward, the designers went to an aquarium and a zoo; images such as a human with a lion’s head now pop up on the clothes.Cat & Jack will be more up-to-the-minute than the Circo and Cherokee labels, but the clothes have to cost the same, from $4.50 to $39.99. Executives also want to highlight Target’s one-year guarantee on its own brands of clothes; no surprise that the promise tested well with everyone, especially, they say, Hispanic customers.To make the math work, Target is signing longer-term contracts with its apparel suppliers, which are concentrated in Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, and Indonesia. Nusz and Steklenski introduced suppliers to Cat & Jack early in the design process and solicited ideas for materials, such as one they’re calling Tough Cotton, a cotton-and-spandex blend softened by a chemical that Steklenski claims is safe enough to drink and makes the cotton fibers stronger with every wash. “And we have tough negotiation tactics,” Guggemos says. Target, like other price-conscious retailers, requires its suppliers to justify every cost for every item each year, rather than start with the budget from the prior year. The new executive in charge of the supply chain is Arthur Valdez, who used to work at Amazon.“Target is operating at the low end of the market, and they put pressure on the contract manufacturers to reduce cost by any available means,” says Scott Nova, executive director of the Workers Rights Consortium. “Target is typical of a mass-market retailer, but that’s not good.” Thomas, the company’s spokesman, says: “Target is committed to responsible business conduct and this includes respect for workers’ rights.” The retailer publishes a list of the factories it uses for its brands and pledges not to work with vendors who hire child labor or require more than a 60-hour workweek. It says it regularly audits suppliers to make sure they’re complying with the company’s social responsibility requirements.Cat & Jack wasn’t the favorite when the marketing team tested three names for the line last summer. Another name—which executives don’t want to share in case they find a use for it later—was the most popular, but that was because the group thought it sounded like “a basic brand with really great value,” says Michelle Mesenburg, vice president for style marketing. In other words, like the Target that Target doesn’t want to be. So they went with Cat & Jack, which sounds upscale, maybe a little vintage, while still, they hope, leaving a lot to the imagination. It may also sound a little familiar: There’s already a Janie and Jack brand, a Jack & Jill, and a Jack & Lily.Like contemporary parents who give children so much decision-making power, Target is also learning about the institutional confusion that comes when children are really seen and heard. Kids will be involved in the Cat & Jack marketing campaign. Their photos will be in ads and in stores and when Target’s back-to-school promotion begins in late July. Some of those ads and social media spots will be written and directed by kids, too. The professionals are figuring out when and how much to be involved. At first, “we didn’t want it to be ‘made by kids,’ with us giving them all kinds of direction,” Jones, the chief marketing officer, says. Now he says he’s worried that “if these kids are really good, will it look like it’s made by kids?”—in other words, Cat & Jack can’t look too grown-up. A few weeks after that conversation, Target decided to also make its own, adult-directed Cat & Jack TV commercial to air in July.Cat & Jack will be the second brand Guggemos and her team will have introduced this year. The first, Pillowfort, is for kids’ bedrooms and includes bunk beds, desks, sheets, and accessories. Target sold all those items before, but didn’t put a lot of design effort into them. Now there are lots of prints and patterns to be mixed and matched for boys and girls. Pillowfort is selling 15 percent better than the old stuff was, and Cornell says it could double the kids’ home business line over the next three years.The attention, investment, and pressure on new brands such as Pillowfort, part of Cornell’s signature categories, are so far paying off. Sales for the brands and categories rose more than three times as fast as the company average in the first quarter of 2016. But overall, it was an underwhelming start to the year. Target’s same-store sales rose 1.2 percent for the period, less than expected. Cornell, like executives at many other retailers, blamed “an increasingly volatile consumer environment” and bad weather in the Northeast. He says that figure could be flat or down as much as 2 percent in the second quarter. It would be the first time sales have declined since he took over. Still, Cornell says, “the elevated focus we’ve applied to our signature categories is proving out, but we’re just at the beginning of the journey.”Customers and the economy will decide whether Target bought the plane tickets to the most profitable final destination. “Those signature categories have been growing quickly,” says Kantar Retail’s Koo, “but there’s only so much of that stuff you can get people to buy. They still have to get the basics, like groceries, right.” Those are what bring people into the stores regularly. Cornell knows that families don’t need new clothes as often as they need food, but they need new clothes more frequently than industrial-chic filament-bulb string lights and stuffed giraffe heads for a child’s bedroom wall. Cat & Jack, then, is supposed to exist somewhere between the granola and the giraffe.Back at Target headquarters in May, Steklenski says she’s started working on a “truly fashion aesthetic” line for kids that will arrive in stores in 2017. Everyone likes to feel they can control their destiny. Cat & Jack won’t be all that determines Target’s future, but the brand might help it, as the T-shirts say, “Dream Like a Unicorn.” Or at least “Run Hard,” and maybe “Win Big.”—With Shannon Pettypiece '),\n",

       "  'A scene from the Star Trek episode Spock’s Brain, which aired on Sept. 20, 1968.As Paramount Pictures prepares to celebrate Star Trek’s 50th anniversary with the release of Star Trek Beyond in July, the studio has reason to thank the franchise’s fans. Since almost the first Star Trek TV episode, Trekkies have fueled interest in creator Gene Roddenberry’s science fiction fantasies, spawning their own works, holding conventions, and spurring the creation of 12 movies and five follow-up TV series. “They realize that their fans are their biggest assets,” says Rebecca Tushnet, an intellectual-property expert at Georgetown University Law Center.Now, the studio says, one fan has gone too far. Alec Peters has made a 20-minute Star Trek docudrama called Prelude to Axanar, recounting a confrontation between the Federation of Planets and the Klingon Empire. Created with $100,000 raised on Kickstarter, the video has generated more than 2 million YouTube views since Peters posted it in August 2014. Paramount Pictures and CBS, the owners of the Star Trek movie and TV franchise, have filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against Peters, saying he copied numerous elements from their properties.The lawsuit, which on May 9 survived Peters’s motion to dismiss, argues that the video infringes Paramount’s and CBS’s copyrights, “which, of course, we will continue to vigorously protect,” the studio and CBS said in an e-mailed statement. They’re asking the judge to rule that their work has been used without permission and to order Peters to stop the alleged infringement. The studio and network are seeking $150,000 in statutory damages for each copyrighted work they claim has been infringed. Peters says he’s not using any main Star Trek characters; the studios, he responds, haven’t shown that they’ve been harmed by his video.The studios are taking a risk by going to court. “You don’t want to go after your own fans, because it can create a backlash,” says Rollin Ransom, an intellectual-property lawyer in Los Angeles. Some copyright holders, such as Lucasfilm, the Walt Disney unit behind the Star Wars movies, encourage fans by holding an annual contest for the best short-form fan videos. “These are the people who are watching, buying, and reading your products,” says Steve Sansweet, former head of fan relations at Lucasfilm.Inexpensive digital video equipment and easy-to-use editing tools have helped fuel the fan film genre. Video sites such as YouTube are filled with tributes to and parodies of TV shows, movies, and video games, including Game of Thrones, Doctor Who, Batman, and Call of Duty. Copyright holders were more aggressive in the early days of the Internet, according to Tushnet. Today, studios such as Paramount “rarely interfere with what fans do” online, she says.Why sue Peters and not other fans? Paramount doesn’t offer an explanation. Tushnet and Ransom say they know of no comparable suit filed by a studio over a fan film. They speculate that the professional nature of Peters’s work and the money raised may have alarmed Paramount and CBS. “Previous Star Trek fan films have been self-funded,” says Tushnet. “The concern for the studios would be that if this is going to be a big deal, they need to get out in front of it,” says intellectual-property lawyer Aaron Moss, who has represented Japanese movie studio Toho over the unlicensed use of its best-known character, Godzilla.Prelude to Axanar, which includes interviews with Starfleet commanders played by professional actors, is the precursor to a planned feature-length film for which Peters has raised $638,500 on Kickstarter. The movie will tell the story of Garth of Izar, a Starfleet captain who appeared in the original TV series as an inmate at an insane asylum and a hero of Captain Kirk’s.Peters, who was 6 when the TV series premiered in 1966, has had a lifelong fascination with Garth. “If Garth is Kirk’s hero, I want to know who this guy is,” he says. He and his lawyer, Erin Ranahan, say the works break new ground. “What we’re doing is cutting-edge,” Peters says.The outcome of the suit will likely rest on whether Ranahan can convince the judge that Prelude to Axanar is transformative, adding new meaning to the original works. The case could ultimately provide guidelines for how to make the longer movie without running afoul of the studios, Ranahan says. For now, Peters’s feature film is on hold until the lawsuit is resolved.The bottom line: The writer-director of a Star Trek fan film captured Paramount’s and CBS’s attention after raising more than $600,000 on Kickstarter.'),\n",

       "  'When Captain America bursts back onto the big screen on May 6, audiences will likely be thrilled by his much anticipated fight with Iron Man. The outcome of the battle, however, is a foregone conclusion: Walt Disney will emerge victorious. Box-office analysts say Captain America: Civil War—the eighth Marvel film from Disney since it bought the company in 2009 and the third Captain America film—could rival the biggest hits in the franchise. The reviews are overwhelmingly positive, and advanced ticket sales have eclipsed those of other superhero movies, confounding naysayers who were warning that moviegoers might be tiring of the genre.The likely blockbuster kicks off a potentially record-breaking summer for ticket sales and what analysts say could be Disney’s best year at the movies in its history. Disney, with a 25 percent market share this year, is dominating the film business to an unprecedented degree. In the first half, Disney will have the No. 1 movie for 13 of those 26 weeks, predicts Barton Crockett, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets. “They will have the highest share in a generation, or maybe of all time,” he says.The studio also is scoring points with a mix of nostalgia flicks such as its Star Wars sequel and technology-driven hits like The Jungle Book, Crockett says. “They seem to have a finger on the pulse of what the public wants at a level that I haven’t seen before.”Disney’s advantages lie in its storytelling ability and the strength—and number—of its brands. Time Warner’s Warner Bros. has DC Comics, and Comcast’s Universal Pictures has a strong animation arm, but Disney has unparalleled scale. This is largely because of an acquisition spree by Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger, which included Lucasfilm, Marvel, and Pixar. That built the studio into five potent film brands while competitors weren’t investing in the risky business.Playing catch-up, rival studios are digging into their archives to remake films with new twists, such as Sony Pictures’ all-female Ghostbusters. Or they’re having to find franchise properties, such as Paramount Pictures’ venture with Hasbro to bring to the screen a universe constructed around action figure G.I. Joe. The pressure to compete will probably encourage acquisitions. “Smaller firms with unique content will continue to be takeover targets,” says Christopher Marangi, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds, an investor in media stocks. But some analysts worry that industry pressure could lead to expensive acquisitions that destroy value as movie companies chase—and overpay for—targets like Lions Gate Entertainment, creator of Twilight and The Hunger Games.Disney’s multibillion-dollar investment in production companies since 2006 has come to fruition in 2016. The five film units could this year release a record number of movies that break $1 billion in ticket sales. “We have talked for 25 years about the big six global entertainment companies, [but] maybe we are starting to see the stratification among them,” says Jonathan Kuntz, a film historian and professor at the UCLA School of Theater, Film & Television. “\\u2009‘Supermajors’ might be a good term for what Disney, and maybe Comcast and Time Warner, aspire to be.”For much of the 20th century, Disney, Paramount, Sony Pictures, Warner Bros., Universal Pictures, and 20th Century Fox dominated film production and distribution globally. But Disney’s three acquisitions, along with its two other labels, Walt Disney Animation and Walt Disney Pictures, has left it with some of the best franchises in Hollywood. That’s allowed the studio to map out a combined film slate into 2020.“That is the future for the next decade,” with Disney and Warner Bros. having laid out superhero movies and other sequels, spinoffs, and reboots for years to come, says Jeff Bock, a box-office analyst at Exhibitor Relations. Bock figures that Disney alone will have six or seven of the top 10 grossing films this year and potentially four movies each generating $1 billion worldwide: Captain America: Civil War; The Jungle Book; Rogue One: A Star Wars Story; and Finding Dory, a sequel to Finding Nemo.“The Pixar acquisition saved Disney Animation,” says Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Jessica Reif Cohen. “That was the beginning.” Disney is “the only company right now that has a branded film strategy,” she says, with each of its sub-brands churning out its own string of reliable, predictable fare. “Consumers know what they are going to get, which makes marketing easy and efficient.”John Lasseter, one of the original Pixar animators and director of the megahit Toy Story, is the creative leader of Pixar and Walt Disney Animation. That’s allowed him to help reinvigorate the animation unit and produce more modern hits, such as Frozen and this year’s Zootopia.Universal is aping that approach with Chris Meledandri, creator of the hugely successful Despicable Me films, who will oversee his Illumination Entertainment, Universal’s animation partner, and the DreamWorks Animation studio Comcast agreed to acquire in April. The buyout is seen as Comcast’s attempt to lock in intellectual property—including the characters from DreamWorks’ Shrek and Kung Fu Panda—that Universal can exploit in its theme parks, the way Disney does. “The industry looks at Disney with envy,” Reif Cohen says. “It is a highly successful and unique strategy, well-executed and hard to duplicate.”Summer is the most lucrative time of year for studios, and analysts predict this season could beat 2013’s record. A slew of highly anticipated releases including Finding Dory and Warner Bros.’ Suicide Squad could, along with Captain America, push the summer season to about $5 billion in ticket sales in North America, estimates Geetha Ranganathan, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.With breakout hits such as Fox’s offbeat antihero Deadpool and the unexpectedly strong turnout for Disney’s The Jungle Book, 2016 could see recently set annual box-office records broken again—especially because Disney’s second Star Wars-related release will hit theaters in December. Crockett estimates 2016 will outstrip the $11.1 billion annual record generated at the domestic box office in 2015 and Disney’s studios will generate more than $3 billion in profit, its largest ever. For now, at least, Hollywood’s biggest star is Disney itself.\\n \\n—With Christopher PalmeriThe bottom line: Disney’s acquisition spree under CEO Iger has positioned the company to dominate the movie business—and give rivals headaches.'),\n",

       "  'Surrounded by security, activists against North Carolina’s “bathroom bill” protest outside the office of House Speaker Tim Moore at the State Legislative Building in Raleigh, N.C., on April 25.In early March, Salesforce.com dispatched its general counsel, Amy Weaver, and its top government affairs executive, Jim Green, to Georgia to lobby against a bill that would have given businesses the right to deny service to lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender customers on religious grounds. Like other so-called religious freedom bills, the Georgia legislation was designed to offer a legal shield for social conservatives. Georgia Governor Nathan Deal wound up vetoing the bill, but Green knew the win in Atlanta would be temporary.Almost 200 bills have been proposed this year in more than 30 states that would limit or prohibit protection against discrimination for LGBT individuals, according to the advocacy group Human Rights Campaign (HRC). Five have passed into law; three have been vetoed; and 144 have died or been withdrawn. “We were like, ‘Whoa,’ and started to realize the scope of the issue,” Green says.In response, large companies that have already contributed millions of dollars to HRC and other advocacy groups to combat anti-LGBT discrimination have been taking steps to coordinate their lobbying activities. “There’s going to be an increasing level of cooperation among companies,” says Kevin Kolevar, vice president for government affairs and public policy at Dow Chemical, who’s been involved in discussions with his counterparts at other corporations. “It’s a strengthening collaboration, but loose. You’re going to start to see the corporate community refining those efforts quite a bit, and it’s going to make more of a difference than it has.”Corporate leaders say they’re primarily motivated not by politics but by business concerns. They need to protect their own employees, create work environments attractive to younger workers, and eliminate the headache of dealing with a patchwork of differing rules for LGBT workers across the country. Companies that support gay employees do better in the stock market, according to research released on April 15 by Credit Suisse. The study found that a group of 270 companies that supported LGBT employees outperformed a global index by 3 percent annually over the past six years.The power of the business lobby on LGBT issues attracted attention last year after Indiana proposed legislation that would have allowed private businesses to deny service to gay people for religious reasons. “We frankly weren’t aware of it before our employees brought it to our attention,” says Salesforce’s Green. Over a period of several weeks, Green flew from San Francisco to Indianapolis to pressure legislators, without success. After the bill was signed by Republican Governor Mike Pence, Green says, “that’s when we became very active.”The bill was ultimately amended in response to the corporate outcry from Salesforce and others. Pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly, which has about 25 percent of its employees in the state, made contributions to Freedom Indiana, an advocacy group supported by HRC, and to Indiana Competes, a coalition of more than 350 mostly small employers opposed to anti-LGBT laws.Most companies are focusing their efforts on states where they have major operations, allowing them to divide the work. Salesforce and Eli Lilly were joined in Indiana by Dow Chemical; its AgroSciences seed and pesticide subsidiary is based in Indianapolis. Disney helped lead efforts in Georgia, where the company and its Marvel Entertainment subsidiary shoot movies. MGM Resorts is helping spearhead opposition to a bill signed into law on April 5 in Mississippi, where the company has two casinos. MGM told state officials the law would increase discrimination and harm tourism and the economy.Apple and Facebook, which have data centers in North Carolina, teamed up with Bank of America and others to pressure Republican Governor Pat McCrory to undo the “bathroom bill” he signed in late March. PayPal executives convened to review the law and discuss its implications on the day it passed, fearing it could hurt the company’s ability to recruit talented workers. Chief Executive Officer Dan Schulman decided to hold off on plans for a $3.6 million operations center, which would employ 400 people, until the law is repealed. On April 12, McCrory signed an executive order partially rolling it back. State Democratic lawmakers filed a measure on April 25 to repeal it entirely, but it’s unlikely to proceed in the Republican-controlled legislature.Some companies are pushing to extend civil LGBT protections, rather than reacting to efforts to curtail them. Hershey spokeswoman Jennifer Sniderman says the chocolate maker has been active in encouraging lawmakers in its home state of Pennsylvania to pass proposed legislation expanding the umbrella of existing anti-discrimination laws.Setting up an effective state-level lobbying operation costs from $25,000 to $100,000, including staff expenses and support for local grass-roots groups, says Matt McTighe, a veteran of fights for same-sex marriage across the country who’s now executive director of Freedom For All Americans, which helps organize companies and local groups. “We can’t keep playing whack-a-mole every time some new anti-LGBT bill gets filed,” he says.HRC also coordinates letter-writing campaigns and local rallies on behalf of large corporations. The group raised almost $54 million in the fiscal year ended March 2015; it doesn’t disclose details on individual contributions, but Apple, Bank of America, Microsoft, and Starbucks are among more than 40 companies it lists as corporate sponsors. (Bloomberg LP, the owner of Bloomberg Businessweek, is also an HRC sponsor; company Chairman Peter Grauer has signed letters opposing religious freedom laws in North Carolina, Missouri, and Mississippi.) In an April 17 appearance on NBC’s Meet the Press, North Carolina’s McCrory acknowledged the influence of HRC’s corporate donors: “They are putting on a lot of pressure.”Proponents of religious freedom measures say they’re representing the interests of small-business owners who don’t want to be forced to accommodate LGBT clients. Matt Sharp, legal counsel for the nonprofit legal advice group Alliance Defending Freedom, has visited Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, and South Carolina this year, consulting with small businesses that serve gay people but want the right to draw the line at participating in same-sex weddings.“We don’t want to be forced by the government to produce speech, to produce expression, uniquely designed floral arrangements, cakes, and photographs that violate our faith,” Sharp says. The group raised $45 million in the fiscal year ended June 2014, according to its most recent publicly available tax filings; like HRC, it’s not required to disclose its donors.Salesforce’s Green says one goal of the lobbying undertaken by his company and other large employers is to make it easier for small businesses to speak out against potentially discriminatory bills. Part of the strategy developed by McTighe, inspired in part by same-sex marriage initiatives, involves using funds donated by big corporations to get local employers involved. Hundreds of smaller companies in Tennessee and Mississippi signed recent letters opposed to anti-LGBT laws, as did local employers in Indiana last year. “Equality is a core value, and where we see negative legislation, we have to take a stand,” Green says. “We want to be a spark for others to get involved in areas and states that are considering these types of legislation.”—With Craig Giammona and Spencer SoperThe bottom line: Some large U.S. corporations are banding together to combat state laws that would block civil LGBT protections.'),\n",

       "  'Charlton Heston as Moses in The Ten Commandments.David A.R. White was raised in a Mennonite household outside Dodge City, Kan., and went to the movies only one time in his first 18 years. “I was at a friend’s house, and he took me to Grease. I was 8 years old. I didn’t know what we were doing,” the 45-year-old filmmaker says, laughing. “And then Olivia Newton-John showed up in her black leather pants, and I thought for sure I was going to hell.”In the years that followed—after playing Kurt von Trapp in a school production of The Sound of Music—White became fascinated with the entertainment industry. At 19, he moved to Los Angeles and found his niche in acting, first in the Burt Reynolds sitcom Evening Shade and eventually in independent Christian productions. In 2005 he co-founded Pure Flix Entertainment, what he calls a “Christ-centered” production-distribution company; he spent close to a decade churning out films that were popular with the Christian bookstore market but failed to score at the multiplex.Everything changed two years ago. In 2014, White produced and starred in God’s Not Dead, an unapologetic, unsubtle Christian drama that became a word-of-mouth hit, earning $62 million against a shoestring $1.2 million budget. Today, the film—about a college student whose faith is challenged by an atheistic philosophy professor—is the fifth-most-profitable movie by percentage in cinema history, with a return on investment of 2,627 percent (positioning it, ironically, directly behind Grease).God’s Not Dead was part of a miniwave of faith-based films that year. Now we’re seeing a flood of biblical proportions. When its sequel—God’s Not Dead 2, about a public school teacher on trial for mentioning Jesus in her classroom—hits theaters on April 1, it joins a conspicuously crowded market of Lent season releases, including Miracles From Heaven, the story of a sick child whose recovery defies medical science, and Risen, which approaches the Resurrection from the perspective of a Roman centurion.Miracles From HeavenIndustry watchers assumed that Miracles and Risen would earn money slowly and steadily leading up to the Easter holiday. Instead, they surged in their opening weekends. Risen out-earned buzzy horror flick The Witch and Jesse Owens biopic Race, trailing only Marvel’s Deadpool and DreamWorks Pictures’ Kung Fu Panda 3. Miracles recouped its $13 million production budget in just four days, knocking the J.J. Abrams-produced 10 Cloverfield Lane out of the top three earners for the week. Explain it however you want: savvy positioning or divine intervention. But when it comes to box office returns, God is good and only getting better.There’s nothing new about Bible films attracting rapturous audiences. After all, the movies are as old as the silver screen itself. Cecil B. DeMille’s The Ten Commandments was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture in 1956, and it’s still the sixth-highest-grossing movie of all time domestically when adjusted for inflation. “What’s different is people calling [these films] faith-based,” says director Cyrus Nowrasteh, whose film The Young Messiah, produced for an estimated $16 million and distributed by Focus Features, premiered last month. “When I was a kid, we went to see The Bible and Ben-Hur. They were just big movies, and people went.”Hollywood’s view of Christian films grew more agnostic in the ensuing decades. A 1977 international production of Jesus of Nazareth became a small-screen success. Martin Scorsese’s The Last Temptation of Christ (1988) was a heretical lightning rod. But for the most part, spiritual subject matters were ignored. Then in 2004, with the religious market largely relegated to the low-budget, direct-to-video format, Mel Gibson’s The Passion of the Christ banked $83 million in its opening weekend, on the way to a mammoth $611 million worldwide gross, shattering expectations of what a Christian production could earn.“All of a sudden, everyone was interested,” says White. Some major studios cranked out a stream of high-profile commercial hits, from the allegorical (Walt Disney’s The Chronicles of Narnia, 2005) to the traditional (New Line Cinema’s The Nativity Story, 2006) to the feel-good inspirational (Warner Bros.’ The Blind Side, 2009), while others—including 20th Century Fox, the Weinstein Co., and Lionsgate—announced faith-based labels or right-of-first-refusal partnerships with Christian filmmakers. But appealing to Christian audiences turned out to be more complicated than simply making movies about Jesus. If you’ve never heard of The Ultimate Gift or The Last Sin Eater—both put out by FoxFaith, Fox’s faith-based unit—there’s a reason for that. Within a few years, most of those divisions and deals had withered and died.“Pointing at The Passion and saying, ‘This is a great model of what faith-based films can do’ is like pointing at Star Wars and saying, ‘This is what a sci-fi movie can do.’ It’s the ultimate example of a particular genre,” says Rich Peluso, senior vice president of Sony’s Christian shingle, Affirm Films, which has fared better than most. (Affirm is behind both Miracles and Risen, as well as 2014’s Heaven Is for Real, which grossed more than $91 million in the U.S.) “But it did cause people to pay attention to the fact that the faith community will respond to a film and come out in droves.”The most successful Christian films of the last few years have largely defied Hollywood convention. Star power takes a back seat to a loud-and-clear message. Many of the leads in God’s Not Dead and its sequel—Kevin Sorbo, Dean Cain, Melissa Joan Hart—reached peak fame in the mid-’90s. Independent producers and distributors like White’s Pure Flix have found a foothold in the space by providing supplemental study material for church groups and launching a home-streaming service in the Netflix mold. Another outfit, EchoLight Studios—whose chief executive officer is former Pennsylvania senator and onetime presidential candidate Rick Santorum—has experimented with a distribution model in which films are first released to church audiences to drum up grass-roots support.Ultimately, conventional wide-release engagement is still the goal. “We’re looking for the same thing that Sony and Warner Bros. are looking for,” says EchoLight President Jeff Sheets. “That’s ubiquity. We want our movies to be available as soon as possible to as many people as possible.” If Tinseltown values a great story above all, how can it resist the Greatest Story Ever Told? “There’s an audience out there for these films that isn’t necessarily Christian,” The Young Messiah’s Nowrasteh says. “It’s not as if secular people can’t appreciate them.”Chasing crossover appeal can be risky, though. Take Exodus: Gods and Kings, director Ridley Scott’s 2014 Moses-Pharaoh showdown, which went heavy on Christian Bale and light on actual Christianity and failed to recoup even half of its $140 million price tag domestically. Darren Aronofsky’s Noah, starring Russell Crowe as the Old Testament ark builder, did better at the box office the same year but drew protests from faith groups for not being true to Scripture. “Aronofsky is a self-proclaimed atheist,” White says. (Aronofsky has described himself in interviews as a humanist, not an atheist.) “The studio heads aren’t really interested in this market, nor do they really know it, so they’re thinking, We’re spending a hundred million, so let’s try to make it a crossover movie—a disaster epic. Let’s do the least amount that we have to do to gather the faith audience, because they’re stupid; they’ll come to anything that has the Bible in it. But the problem is, the faith audience isn’t stupid. They’ve been treated by Hollywood for years and years as if they are, and they’re tired of that.”A dozen years after the post-Passion boom, Hollywood is starting to learn from the sins of the past, scaling back gluttonous budgets and vowing not to bear false witness in production and promotion. “Studios like Sony have seen that these movies are low-cost, and, if marketed correctly, they can be very profitable,” says Matthew Belloni, executive editor of the Hollywood Reporter. “It’s hit-and-miss, but the downside isn’t big. If one thing works, everyone will try to copy it.” Paramount Pictures has two faith-based films on its calendar: a remake of Ben-Hur, for which it enlisted Mark Burnett, the TV super-producer behind 2013’s most-watched miniseries, The Bible; and Same Kind of Different As Me, an inspirational love-thy-neighbor drama starring Renée Zellweger, based on a best-selling memoir that got 4.5 out of 5 stars on Christianbooks.com. In May, upstart distributor Broad Green Pictures will try its luck with Last Days in the Desert, with Ewan McGregor as Jesus and three-time Oscar winner Emmanuel Lubezki as cinematographer.“Success begets success,” Affirm Films’ Peluso says. “As these films make a bigger impact, they start to attract other producers, directors, and talent who say, ‘Wow, this can really work.’\\u200a” White’s grateful to have the zeitgeist on his side, but he’s not depending on it. “God’s Not Dead talks a lot about religious freedoms and liberties. It’s very current to what’s happening in our society,” he says. “And it was a great story—a classic story of David overcoming Goliath. It’s our hope, certainly, that [the sequel] will go above and beyond, but we’ll serve our audience first.”EchoLight’s big play for mainstream success will come in September, with the release of Vanished: Left Behind—Next Generation, a young-adult Rapture drama. Starring a crop of MTV talent, it invites comparisons to HBO’s The Leftovers and dystopian feature films like Divergent. While the Christian base may be more than enough to make the film a righteous profit, Sheets is banking on engagement beyond the Sunday school crowd. “One of the greatest compliments I received was from a Lionsgate executive” who saw an early cut of the film, he says. “She told me, ‘In the same way that you don’t have to believe in vampires to watch Twilight, you don’t have to be a follower of Jesus to watch Vanished.’ She’s exactly right.”'),\n",

       "  'From left: Andrea Barber, Jodie Sweetin, and Candace Cameron Bure on Fuller House.“Whoa, I’m having an acid flashback,” says wacky next-door neighbor Kimmy Gibbler upon entering the Tanner home in the first episode of Netflix’s Full House reboot. Fans of the sitcom, which aired from 1987 to 1995, will feel the same déjà vu seeing the Tanners together again around the kitchen table. When Kimmy (Andrea Barber) corrects herself and says she’s actually having an antacid flashback, viewers old enough to have watched the show on Friday nights in the ’80s may identify with that, too.Hollywood studios have banked on the nostalgia-inducing power of revived franchises for years; now TV networks are committing to the practice with the glee of a live studio audience. Already this year, Fox brought back The X-Files for a six-show miniseries. New Twin Peaks and Gilmore Girls episodes are being plotted, too.This model isn’t exactly revolutionary. Star Trek, Doctor Who, and Battlestar Galactica were all successfully rebooted; Charlie’s Angels, Beverly Hills 90210, and Knight Rider were—let’s be generous—not. In these cases, networks tried to revive a series and see if they could replicate their initial success. Netflix has committed to 13 episodes of Fuller House, and Disney Channel is all in on Girl Meets World, but many of the second comings are designed to last only a dozen or fewer episodes, with as much reminiscing as possible jammed in.Fuller House, which premieres Feb. 26, is a gender-swapped version of its parent series. In the original, widower Danny Tanner (Bob Saget) recruits his best friends, Jesse and Joey (John Stamos and Dave Coulier, respectively), to help raise his three daughters. On Fuller House, eldest daughter D.J. (Candace Cameron-Bure), now a veterinarian, returns home following her husband’s death—it seems you don’t want to marry a Tanner—and enlists best friend Kimmy and younger sister Stephanie (Jodie Sweetin) to move in and co-parent her three sons. High jinks ensue.The humor is essentially unchanged, though characters repeat catchphrases (like Uncle Jesse’s “Have mercy!”) with a wink and a nod in the same way they make references to the ’90s: “My moves are all that and a bag of chips, so talk to the hand,” Kimmy says after doing the Hammertime dance. Fuller House is fun not because of plot twists and turns—it’s hardly trying to compete on that front—but because it takes us back to when a lame gag about how boys are more focused on sandwiches than girls could get a laugh.The absence of Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, who were cast as youngest sister Michelle on Full House, is glaring. But playing a grown-up toddler can’t be a good look for women who’ve become a big deal in the fashion world. This is addressed in the first episode when Danny says, “Michelle sends her love, but she’s busy in New York running her fashion empire.” The cast looks into the camera, as if to echo a Stephanie catchphrase: “How rude.”And you know what? It is rude. What we want with a reboot is to pick up where we left off, like nothing’s changed. But that’s hard. The casting for Twin Peaks hasn’t yet been confirmed. Gilmore Girls will go forward without the now-very-famous Melissa McCarthy, though. As the Full House theme song—which is also the Fuller House theme song, covered by Carly Rae Jepsen—asks, “Whatever happened to predictability?”'),\n",

       "  \"Robert Arnold, 68, worked for AT&T for 35 years, testing phone lines and cables for its TV service. While he worked there, he used his employer’s cell plan. After retiring, he didn’t want to pay AT&T’s rates—or Verizon’s, for that matter, or T-Mobile’s or Sprint’s. Paying $35 a month for one line with no data or texting was too expensive, he says. He’s still using AT&T’s network, but he’s not giving the company a cent.Instead, he pays $38 monthly for two lines’ worth of phone, text, and data from Consumer Cellular, a much smaller operator that rents capacity from AT&T’s network. “I’m getting exactly the same service for less money,” says Arnold, except the customer service is better.Companies such as Consumer Cellular are known as mobile virtual network operators, or MVNOs. Essentially they’re marketing and customer service operations, leasing network capacity from the Big Four U.S. carriers and reselling it under their own brands. Switching carriers typically saves customers at least $20 a month (some base their charges on use), and MVNOs often target niche audiences—seniors, kids, immigrants.Years ago, the iPhone killed a lot of these companies, which couldn’t keep up with consumer demand for increasingly data-hungry smartphones. Times have changed: It’s a lot cheaper and easier to run an MVNO than it used to be, and more customers are seeking an alternative to the Verizons and AT&Ts of the world. MVNOs account for 36 million (1 in 10) U.S. wireless subscriptions, estimates researcher Strategy Analytics, roughly double their 2009 numbers. During that time, subscriptions at the Big Four rose 28 percent.Arnold’s Consumer Cellular plan includes 750 minutes, 500 megabytes of data, and 3,000 texts; overage runs to 25¢ a minute. AT&T’s cheapest monthly phone plan, with unlimited talk and text and 300MB of data, costs $45.In the old days, when the 150 U.S. MVNOs had names like Amp’d Mobile and Voce, most didn’t turn a profit. Even with brands like Walt Disney and ESPN backing them, many failed in a matter of months, often squeezed by the cost of network capacity. Today the U.S. has about 300 MVNOs, 60 percent of them profitable, estimates Alex Besen, chief executive officer of consulting firm Besen Group. Driving their rise are some fundamental changes in the way the wireless industry operates.Three years ago, T-Mobile led an industrywide push away from the two-year service contracts familiar to U.S. wireless customers, making it easier for people to comparison shop and change providers. Making a switch cheaper still, the Big Four providers announced last year they’d stop the practice of “locking” their phones, meaning that for the first time you could move your iPhone from Sprint’s network to AT&T’s without having to buy a new one. (Sometimes, of course, there are technical difficulties.) “The shift in how handsets are purchased has been hugely beneficial for MVNOs,” says Susan Welsh de Grimaldo, an analyst for Strategy Analytics.Behind the scenes, the big guys were getting a lot more reasonable with MVNOs, too. Wholesale rates for network capacity have fallen as much as 65 percent in the past five years and are expected to keep dropping. Partly, that’s because the maturing U.S. market offers carriers a shrinking number of ways to increase the number of people using their networks. “The success and growth of our MVNOs is success to Sprint,” says Scott Kalinoski, a vice president at Sprint, which sells capacity to more than 100 MVNOs.Many MVNOs have begun pitting carriers against one another. When signing a new customer, Consumer Cellular, which works with AT&T and T-Mobile, picks a network based on which has better coverage in the person’s area. A handful of MVNOs, including Red Pocket Mobile, work with all top carriers. “We see this as an important part of our value proposition,” says Red Pocket President Joshua Gordon. “You can bring any phone, keep your number, and save money.”Three MVNO brands—Consumer Cellular, Ting, and Republic Wireless—sit at the top of Consumer Reports’ latest industry rankings for customer service satisfaction. The giant names score the worst. Mike Gikas, senior electronics editor at Consumer Reports, says people who use MVNOs often report better call quality than they did for the carriers that provide the actual capacity.Based largely on popular demand, MVNOs are starting to take up more space on retail shelves. Three-year-old Ultra Mobile is in about 25,000 U.S. stores, including Target and 7-Eleven. Pure TalkUSA, which markets to older consumers and young families, expanded into more than 1,600 Sears and Kmart stores last year, and Chief Operating Officer Norman Klugman says about 20 percent of subscribers were referred by existing customers.Consumer Cellular’s revenue rose about 30 percent last year, to $620 million. From 2012 to 2015, rival Ultra Mobile saw its sales rise from less than $1 million to almost $200 million, placing first on Inc.’s list of America’s fastest-growing private companies. TracFone Wireless, the largest U.S. MVNO and a subsidiary of América Móvil, is “a cash machine,” says CEO F.J. Pollak.Cash machines, of course, have withdrawal limits. TracFone’s revenue rose just 2.6 percent, to $5.1 billion, over the first nine months of 2015. The company blames more price competition from bigger players. “Carriers don’t seem to care too much how much they spend on acquiring customers,” says Pollak.Another factor: The success of the new generation of MVNOs imposes a ceiling on how much each can grow. The Besen Group estimates that 50 to 60 MVNOs will be launched in 2016, including one from Comcast. The flip side of customers’ preference for unknown carrier brands, Welsh de Grimaldo says, is that it’s tough to make them stand out. Kalinoski says the companies that appear to be having the most success focus on specific groups of customers, like people interested in donating a portion of their bill to women's-rights groups.Good customer service and low prices have a pretty broad audience, says Michael Goldstein, a vice president at Ting, which claims about 200,000 subscribers. “Those of us who are hungry and are doing back flips,” he says, “are doing a better job pleasing people.”The bottom line: The U.S. MVNO industry has doubled since 2009 as costs have fallen and dissatisfaction with bigger companies has grown.\"),\n",

       "  'His Holiness the Venerable Abbot Shi Yongxin would deliver the money himself. Five thousand miles from the Shaolin Temple, the ancient Buddhist monastery and wellspring of kung fu that he oversees in the mountains of central China, a city council in Australia had approved his purchase of some land. Attuned to the power of symbolic gestures, Yongxin wanted to seal the deal in person, so in February the cherubic, saffron-robed abbot journeyed from Henan province to Shoalhaven, New South Wales, and handed the mayor a check for $3 million. Yongxin smiled and pressed his hands together, as if in prayer. “It is destiny,” he said.Yongxin had negotiated for the property for nearly a decade. He wanted to build a complex there called Shaolin Village, where Australians and international tourists could learn about Chan Buddhism and the temple’s famed warrior monks. But to think of Shaolin Village as a temple would be like calling Versailles a house. In addition to a monastery and kung fu academy, the development Yongxin envisioned included a four-star hotel with 500 beds, residential villas, and a 27-hole golf course, at a cost of more than $270 million.Yongxin, in his 16 years as head of the Shaolin Temple, had presided over many business ventures and was known across China and the world as the “CEO monk.” Since taking his vows of piety in the early 1980s, he had transformed the Shaolin Temple—a picturesque compound of prayer halls, tree-dabbled courtyards, and Buddhist shrines set against a lush mountainside—from a poor and relatively unknown outpost into a global brand. He became a symbol of the successful intersection of church, state, and commerce in China, a kind of anti-Dalai Lama who enjoys political favor as well as spiritual status.Yongxin first drew national attention in China in the mid-1990s, when he filed a lawsuit against a company that produced Shaolin brand sausages—a product that was not only unauthorized but also, given the Buddhist monks’ vegetarianism, particularly off-message. To prevent further brand dilution, he created the Henan Shaolin Temple Industrial Development Co. and registered the name Shaolin as a trademark. While abbots had traditionally overseen only the temple grounds, Yongxin got the shabby warren of shops and martial arts schools outside the complex demolished, in the name of preserving its character, and he clashed with the local government over ticket sales to the region. He also created the Shaolin Kungfu Monk Corps, a touring troupe that performs for paying audiences from Thailand to Canada.For centuries, the monks of the Shaolin Temple mostly prayed and practiced martial arts, while living off the land and the donations of worshippers. Under Yongxin, their activities expanded to include food and medicine sales, construction, entertainment, and consulting. In 2006 the temple teamed with a Shenzhen media company to produce Kungfu Star, an American Idol-style TV competition. Shaolin announced last year that it would begin developing mobile apps, including instructional kung fu software. The Shaolin Village project in Australia was only the next logical step in the abbot’s expansionist theo-corporate empire. “If China can import Disney resorts,” he said in March, “why can’t other countries import the Shaolin Monastery?”Yongxin had a knack for politics as well as business. He was both vice chairman of the Buddhist Association of China and a member of the National People’s Congress, the country’s legislature. He met with luminaries, including Nelson Mandela, the queen of England, and Tim Cook, the head of Apple. Within the temple, he commanded a loyal following among its 400 or so monks. “He’s the person I respect the most,” said Shi Yanlu, one of Yongxin’s most trusted disciples, at one point. “He really dares to dream.”Then, on July 25, a message about Yongxin appeared on a Chinese Internet forum. Its authors claimed to be Shaolin disciples and used the pseudonym Shi Zhengyi. Shi is a title taken by all Shaolin monks, and zhengyi means “justice” in Mandarin. Borrowing the language of President Xi Jinping’s ongoing anticorruption campaign, which promises to target both “tigers” (high-level officials) and “flies” (low-level ones), the post asked, “Who will supervise the big tiger Shi Yongxin?” To “protect the hall of our ancestors” and “revitalize Shaolin,” the self-proclaimed whistle-blowers were “bravely stepping forward to reveal the rule-breaking and lawbreaking of Shaolin Temple Abbot Shi Yongxin.” His misdeeds, they charged, included raping a nun, fathering two children, embezzling funds, and generally “staining the reputation of the Shaolin Temple.” The accusers posted photos of a nun and a small child who were supposedly Yongxin’s mistress and daughter.Over the next few days, Zhengyi released new material. Side-by-side photos seemed to show that Yongxin had not one but two housing registrations, which is illegal in China. A police report included handwritten notes from the interrogation of a Shenzhen businesswoman who claimed she’d slept with Yongxin and had been threatened by his disciples; one of them “told me he’d let me have a comfortable death,” she told the police. A social media user, posting under the same woman’s name, uploaded a photo of dirty underwear supposedly worn during a sexual encounter with Yongxin and claimed to have saved a condom used by the abbot. Letters bearing the official stamps of former Shaolin abbots said that Yongxin had been expelled from the temple—twice. The documents’ authenticity wasn’t confirmed, but those inclined to believe the charges saw in Yongxin a classic portrait: the outwardly pious religious leader exposed as a hypocrite, abusing his authority to commit sins of the flesh and the purse.Yongxin made a show of proceeding with business as usual. On its website, the temple dismissed the charges as “vicious slander” and called for the government to investigate and prosecute the accusers. Yongxin taunted them in an interview with Global Times, a Chinese newspaper, published on Aug. 3. “If I really had a problem, you wouldn’t have to post accusations about me on the Internet,” he said. “You could go directly to the relevant departments.”He might have regretted the challenge. That week, six Shaolin disciples traveled north to Beijing and, on Aug. 8, walked into the Supreme People’s Procuratorate, the central government agency that handles investigations. The group included a former head of the Monk Corps, several other senior monks, and, leading them, Yongxin’s trusted disciple, Shi Yanlu. Within a week, government investigators were visiting the Shaolin Temple and scrutinizing the Yongxin empire. The Shaolin Temple was founded in 495 A.D. by the monk Buddhabhadra, who had traveled from India to China. It’s considered the birthplace of Chan Buddhism, a precursor of Zen Buddhism. At the foot of Mt. Song, the temple became known for its warrior monks—a contradiction, given their commitment to nonviolence, but an advantage during wartime—when, in the year 621, a group of Shaolin monks came to the aid of the Tang emperor in battle. The temple thrived during the Ming dynasty, as government officials recruited its monks for 16th century military campaigns, including several battles against Japanese pirates. One account describes a group of 120 monks killing more than 100 “dwarf pirates,” while suffering only four casualties.The Shaolin fared worse under the Qing (1644-1911), as the new rulers, questioning the monks’ loyalty, tried to curb their military activity. In 1928 the temple was torched by a Nationalist general. The rise of Mao Zedong and the Communist Party caused damage first spiritual—monks were forbidden to wear robes or practice Buddhist rituals—and then physical, when the Red Guards destroyed many of the temple’s relics during the Cultural Revolution.A 16-year-old named Liu Yingcheng arrived in 1981. Growing up on a farm in Anhui province, he’d often heard stories about Buddhist monks, and was taken with the idea of, in his words, “living a carefree life, coming and going like the clouds and the fog.” Liu’s parents opposed him becoming a monk, so he waited until they were traveling to take some money and sneak away to Shaolin. He found the place in a shambles. The temple was falling apart, and only two dozen monks lived there, eating little but maize paste and steamed buns. There hadn’t been an official abbot for more than 300 years. Still, Liu sought out the acting abbot, an old man named Xingzheng, who agreed to take him on. Liu cooked and grazed cattle while beginning his studies. He was an unremarkable martial artist, but he was smart, and Xingzheng took a liking to him. During the young man’s vow ceremony, the abbot gave him the dharma name Yongxin.Any sense of tranquility was about to end. In 1982 the film The Shaolin Temple, shot on location and starring a 19-year-old kung fu phenom named Jet Li, became one of the first Chinese-made international blockbusters. Inspired by the story of a slave boy fleeing to Shaolin to learn kung fu and avenge his father’s death, would-be monks made pilgrimages to the temple and offered to join its ranks. Children flocked from around the country to study martial arts, and dozens of training schools opened. Tourism spiked from roughly 50,000 visitors per year in the late 1970s to 2.6 million in 1984.Yongxin fought the local government over ticket revenue.Yongxin watched this explosion with some trepidation, but mostly excitement—it was an opportunity to spread Shaolin beliefs to more people. At the same time, the central government’s grip on religion was starting to relax. Xingzheng took advantage of the “reform and opening” policies of Deng Xiaoping to push for greater independence for the temple, traveling frequently to lobby officials in the provincial capital and Beijing. He would often bring along Yongxin, who became known as Xingzheng’s “walking stick.”In his memoir, Shaolin Temple in My Heart, Yongxin remembers traveling on the cheap, eating bread they’d packed themselves and staying in bathhouses. (Yongxin, through a spokesman, declined several requests to be interviewed.) He met officials and learned the importance of political connections. Xingzheng successfully persuaded the government to let the monks wear robes again and to allow ticket sales, which generated an income for the temple. In this radically open economic landscape, Yongxin saw firsthand how the temple could leverage the Jet Li miracle into security, autonomy, and growth.Some accounts suggest Yongxin became too keen a student of power. According to a recent report by Sina News, a Chinese news portal, in 1986, as Xingzheng was preparing for a ceremony that would officially make him abbot, he couldn’t find a necessary scroll. Xingzheng accused Yongxin of stealing the sacred object out of a desire to become abbot himself. At first Yongxin denied the charge, then reportedly admitted guilt and gave the scroll back. Xingzheng also learned that Yongxin had been referring to himself as Shaolin’s “second in command,” and sometimes even as “abbot,” according to Sina.Xingzheng expelled Yongxin from the temple, according to documents posted by Shi Zhengyi and statements by people who were at Shaolin at the time. But Yongxin refused to leave, even when, per one account, some monks took his bedding and personal items and threw them out of the temple. A year later, documents released by Shi Zhengyi appear to show, a new “honorary” abbot, Shi Dechan, again tried to kick Yongxin out. He wrote a letter to the Buddhism Association of China enumerating Yongxin’s alleged offenses, including inciting monks to beat up an electrician. Again, Yongxin refused to be dismissed. The farm boy who had come to Shaolin wishing to come and go like the clouds and the fog had learned the power of staying put. He built his own base of supporters and, with higher-ranking monks either too ill or too unpopular to take charge, eventually emerged as the de facto leader of the temple, the monk with the clearest ability to continue the modernization that Xingzheng had begun.In 1995, Yongxin organized a celebration of the Shaolin Temple’s 1,500th anniversary, inviting government officials, Buddhist leaders, and thousands of guests from around the world. In a clever bit of political theater, he put on display a memorial tablet commemorating the 50th anniversary of China’s victory over Japan. The five-day celebration got extensive media coverage and helped establish the Shaolin Temple as the preeminent monastery in China. “It was exceptionally successful,” Yongxin wrote in his memoir. Four years later, he went through the official induction ceremony and was named 30th abbot of the Shaolin Temple. He was 34 years old. “I always persist in things that I am determined to do,” he wrote. “People might not understand for the moment, but everything will become clear at last.”I’d heard a lot about the commercialization of the Shaolin Temple, but nothing could prepare me for my first encounter with Buddhism Inc. I paid the steep $16 entrance fee and walked the long, tree-lined path from the front gate of the Songshan Shaolin Scenic Area to the temple. The lilting theme song from Shaolin Temple, the movie, played from speakers in the trees. Tour groups congregated in front of the temple, snapping photos of its front steps, sloping tile roofs, and, despite a rule against it, the occasional monk. A man in a puffy jacket offered to sell me a Photoshopped picture of myself with Yongxin and Vladimir Putin flanking me like bodyguards. I shelled out $30 to see the 400-person nighttime Shaolin Zen Music Ritual, and caught a kung fu performance where the stage was emblazoned with the name of a tire company. In the mall-like gift shop, I bought a toy gun.One evening I was sitting in a nearby guesthouse, reading a copy of Yongxin’s memoir, when an old man with a long white beard shuffled over. His son accompanied him and said his father had studied at the temple long ago. The old man stepped to the center of the room and performed an elegant kung fu routine, striking and kicking invisible enemies. Here it was, I thought: living heritage, unsullied by crass commercialism. When the man finished, I applauded and went to shake his hand. “Now give me some money,” he said.In his book, Yongxin describes his goal for the temple not as commercialization, but rather the preservation and spread of authentic Shaolin culture. To do that, he argues, requires that monks be engaged in the secular world. “It seems that in people’s minds, monks worthy of respect should do nothing but chant prayers,” he writes. “I do not think that way.” He rejects the CEO Monk nickname, but based on past statements, his aim isn’t radically different from that of a Fortune 500 company: growth. Yet growth requires efficiency, rational management, and creative destruction, which don’t always suit religious leaders.If Shaolin is commercial now, it used to be worse—or at least tackier. In the mid-1990s, the area surrounding the temple was filled with souvenir shops selling prayer beads, figurines, swords, and Tasers. There was a roller coaster simulator and a house of horrors with a petrified cadaver. One of Mao’s private planes stood on display. The dirt road to the temple was lined with competing martial arts schools, where students trained to become, typically, kung fu coaches or military personnel, and occasionally Shaolin warrior monks. “They were dazzling, in a weird way,” says Gene Ching, a Shaolin disciple and associate publisher of Kung Fu Tai Chi magazine who first visited in 1995. “My favorite was watching two kids assigned to clean up the street. They got in a fight over a dustpan. At first it was typical push-pull, then one kid trapped the other kid’s hand on the dustpan and put him in an armlock, and the other kid did a tornado kick to disarm him.”Upon becoming abbot in 1999, Yongxin decided to clear out the dreck. “Who would want to visit this filthy and chaotic place?” he wrote. He lobbied the local government to approve demolition in the area and helped pay for it with what he said was the majority of the temple’s savings. Villagers, whose livelihoods were jeopardized, picketed and held banners denouncing the abbot, but in 2002 the forced relocation proceeded. Yongxin was pleased. “Now it possesses a little bit of the poetic charm that I have long cherished for the Shaolin Temple,” he wrote. The project dovetailed with his trademark-protection litigation, as he sought to control the temple’s image locally and abroad. When Yongxin first tried to lay exclusive claim to the name Shaolin, he found that 57 other parties had already registered the trademark in China, as well as 18 in the U.S. and 228 in Japan. After numerous lawsuits, all rights to the name were transferred to the temple in 2009. Yongxin was instilling the modern tenets of brand discipline on a 1,500-year-old faith. But he was also creating a long list of enemies who had been cut out of the Shaolin economy.As Yongxin’s fame grew, his critics accused him of living an increasingly extravagant lifestyle—especially for a monk. In 2006 the government of Dengfeng gave him a Volkswagen SUV worth $125,000 as thanks for his contributions to tourism. “I dream of getting a bigger prize next year,” he said at the time. Three years later, he was again denounced for showing off a cloak with gold thread worth $25,000. He said it was a gift from a brocade company in Nanjing as an example of their shared “intangible cultural heritage.” Allegations of more serious misbehavior began to appear in 2011, when someone claimed online that Yongxin had been caught visiting prostitutes during a police raid. The State Administration for Religious Affairs issued a statement saying the report was only a malicious rumor. Whatever controversies surrounded Yongxin, they never stuck. When he addressed them, it was only in koan-like utterances. “If these things are problems,” he once told a reporter, “they would have become problems by now.”In November, I visited Qian Daliang, the general manager of Shaolin Intangible Assets Management Co. Ltd., which Yongxin had established to oversee the temple’s many subsidiaries. In his spare office inside the temple walls, Qian—the surname means “money”—turned on a small, ineffectual space heater and made tea while he told tales of the Shaolin monks’ greatest financial battles. “Religions should be independent, and economic independence is the most important part,” he said. One of Yongxin’s most significant stands had been with the local government over the issue of allowing the temple to sell tickets—the campaign Abbot Xingzheng had started. Eventually, Qian said, the government agreed that the temple would receive 30 percent of the revenue from ticket sales to the Songshan Shaolin Scenic Area, in which the temple is the main attraction. Temple insiders suspect the local government is trying to reduce its financial dependence on Shaolin. In 2010 the city of Dengfeng started developing plans for a competing temple, to be called Tianzhong. Construction began but was soon delayed. According to a report in Caixin magazine, although Yongxin expressed outward support for the project, many locals believe he played a role in stalling it by raising objections that the construction would damage old relics. Work was halted in May, two months before Shi Zhengyi launched the public crusade against Yongxin.The highway connecting Dengfeng to the Shaolin Temple passes a dozen martial arts schools—tall, gray buildings crowned with almost identical red lettering, most containing the name Shaolin and many run by former monks. Some relocated there after Yongxin’s demolition; others have been erected since, sometimes with temple funds. The schools, which bring in tens of thousands of students every year, including wealthy foreigners, have over the years turned into gold mines for their owners. In 1997, Yongxin reportedly dispatched his disciple Shi Yanlu to found the Shaolin Warrior Monks Training Base and invested 15 million yuan ($2.3 million) in the school. Yanlu, a sinewy specimen, especially compared with Yongxin’s melted-candle figure, had grown up poor in Shandong province and came to Shaolin in 1987. He eventually became a respected warrior monk and one of Yongxin’s loyal aides. During the abbot’s 1999 induction ceremony, Yanlu stood behind Yongxin, holding his umbrella.Yanlu’s school became one of the most successful in the region. It maintained close ties with Shaolin: Yanlu would send his best students to perform in the temple’s kung fu shows, as well as in the lucrative Shaolin Zen Music Ritual song and dance show. Yongxin allowed Yanlu alone to maintain a recruitment office inside the temple.Over time, the relationship frayed. Yanlu began to receive his own high-profile visitors, including the prime minister of Hungary and the king of Cambodia. Temple leaders suspected that Yanlu was no longer sending his best pupils to participate in Shaolin performances, keeping them instead for his own school’s shows. Yanlu further distanced himself from Yongxin when he bought a piece of land and began advertising an ambitious new program called Shaolin Soccer, without involving the temple. Yanlu and Yongxin would squabble over money. According to Yanlu’s report to the government, starting in 2005, Yongxin began asking Yanlu for money. “He was insatiable,” Yanlu’s spokesman told Caixin. Yongxin denied this, saying he “never asked for a cent.” Yanlu also claimed that Yongxin forced him to pay 2 million yuan to the Shenzhen businesswoman with whom the abbot allegedly had sex. “He was the abbot, so I had to do what he said,” Yanlu wrote. “After that, he warned me not to raise the issue of the money or else I’d be kicked out of the temple.”Yanlu has faced his own charges of sacrilege. Several years ago, a photo reportedly circulated in the Shaolin community of Yanlu with his month-old son. As Qian Daliang explained it to one news outlet, Yongxin confronted Yanlu and told him to stop wearing the monastic robes. From then on, when they met in person, Yanlu would dress in everyday clothes, but he still wore the robes at school events. His role as headmaster depended on his image as a pious Shaolin warrior monk—without that, he could lose everything. Yanlu didn’t respond to requests for comment sent to his spokesman.Tensions exploded one day in 2013, when a group of Yanlu’s students tried to enter the Shaolin Temple without tickets. A fight broke out between the students and the Shaolin monks guarding the gate, and the police arrested two of the guards. After that, Yongxin closed Yanlu’s student recruitment office and, according to reports, officially expelled him from the temple. In November, the year’s first snowfall blanketed the monastery. Nearly four months had passed since the charges against Yongxin went viral, and the results of the state investigation still hadn’t been announced. The initial blast of chatter about his fate had quieted to a low hum. No one wanted to talk on the record: Those who had already voiced support for Yongxin had nothing to add, while those who had denounced him didn’t want to say more in case he kept his job after all. As time went on and nothing changed, the locals were beginning to consider the possibility that the abbot, as he had survived past crises, would weather this one. That would be an astonishing anticlimax, given the dynamite nature of the charges, but one that they had to consider—knowing the extent of Yongxin’s power, the thinness of the evidence, the bias of the accusers, and the capriciousness of the Chinese legal system.Then, on Nov. 28, the Henan government released partial results of its investigation. The authorities had split their probe into two parts, one focusing on “disciplinary” charges and the other on “economic” ones. Yongxin was cleared of the former. The claims that he fathered two children were false, according to the report: One of them was in fact adopted by the nun with whom Yongxin had allegedly fathered the child, and anyway the woman had become infertile after an operation; a paternity test revealed that the other was the child of Yongxin’s younger brother. The state’s report also rejected the claim that Yongxin had been expelled from the monastery in the 1980s. In an interview with a Henan newspaper, a member of the investigation team said the expulsion had been “a personal matter” and was “invalid” because it was not approved by the proper government authorities.The results of the “economic” investigation haven’t yet been released. (Nor have investigators explained their unusual choice to publish in thematic installments.) But the findings so far suggest that Yongxin may be headed for exoneration, or at the most a slap on the wrist. The “disciplinary” results are conspicuously incomplete: They fail to address the rape accusation, as well as the charge that Yongxin slept with the Shenzhen businesswoman. Verdicts on these charges don’t appear to be forthcoming.The public response has been predictably cynical. One Chinese netizen spoke for many when he wrote, “He’s a good Party monk, of course he can’t have problems.” The point being, whether he’s guilty or not, Yongxin is too big to fail. If he did, given the gravity of the charges, he would take countless others down with him.It’s true that many party leaders have lost their jobs in recent years because of the anticorruption campaign, and those who fight their accusers rarely win. But those officials have been targeted by the upper rungs of the party. The small group that fingered Yongxin included rogue disciples who had axes to grind. From a stability perspective, his ousting would cause more problems than it would solve. Moreover, he’s a powerful symbol for the Chinese government. His success showcases not only China’s tolerance for organized religion but also the country’s soft power. Shaolin has reached new audiences through every manner of pop culture, from Stephen Chow movies to The Simpsons to the Wu-Tang Clan, whose latest album is titled Once Upon a Time in Shaolin. At a time when China can’t seem to win an Oscar or produce literature that travels well, the fact that American teenagers know the name Shaolin is a source of pride.During my visit to the temple, I went by the office of Wang Yumin, the head of foreign affairs, and told him I wanted to write about how the temple had become so successful under Yongxin. “Successful?” Wang said. He laughed bitterly and gestured around him as if the allegations dogging Yongxin were physical objects in the room. “We don’t think it’s very successful.”'),\n",

       "  'Masha and the BearThe bear has long been a ferocious projection of Russia’s power at home and abroad. Lately, a Russian bear that’s more like a kindly uncle has been winning hearts from Baltimore to Berlin: the affable and patient companion of a mischievous girl in the cartoon Masha and the Bear. The series, which has won accolades worldwide, is one of the top-rated channels on YouTube and made its debut on Netflix in August. The producers are planning a licensing push into everything from yogurt to burgers to plush animals.Moscow production company Animaccord has released 52 six-minute episodes in which the hyperactive Masha typically annoys her long-suffering companion, who’s more interested in fishing or playing checkers. In one story, she wakes him up from hibernation and demands that he teach her to ice skate; in another, he must repeatedly launder and mend her dress after she’s covered in mud, food, and ashes. “Our six-minute series suits the YouTube format very well,” logging a total of more than 5.5 billion views, says Dmitry Loveyko, co-owner of Animaccord. “No amount of promotion could have gotten us to that level. The Internet is a very honest thing.”Loveyko started Animaccord in 2008 with Sergey Kouzmin, a friend from his time at Novosibirsk State University in the 1990s. They teamed up with animator Oleg Kuzovkov, who had the idea of adapting the traditional Russian stories of Masha and her bear to a world of TVs and cell phones. They sought to do for television animation what Pixar Animation Studios and DreamWorks Animation were doing for the big screen. The company uses software from Pixar and Autodesk but also developed its own programs to render images such as water, the bear’s fur, and snow (in abundant supply in stories set in Russia). Animaccord says the show costs about $50,000 per minute—expensive for TV—and that the first 52 episodes took seven years to make. An additional 26 are in the works, to be released over the next three years.Animaccord has grown from about 60 employees two years ago to more than 100, including 70 animators. It’s developed two spinoffs from the series, one in which Masha narrates fairy tales but confuses the details, and another called Masha’s Spooky Stories, aimed at kids slightly younger than the original’s primary audience of 3- to 9-year-olds. Loveyko says he doesn’t have the production resources for a feature-length film or a series with new characters, but he doesn’t rule them out.The series in February won the best animation award at Kidscreen, an annual children’s entertainment conference in Miami. In October it was the No.\\u20095 channel on YouTube, with 383 million views for the month, according to researcher Tubefilter. The most popular episode, “Masha + Kasha,” has had almost 1 billion views, far ahead of anything from the likes of Walt Disney or Nickelodeon. Masha has been translated into 25 languages and airs in more than 100 countries. An English-language YouTube channel, introduced in September 2014, has garnered more than 240 million views. Animaccord hired Elsie Fisher—the voice of Agnes, the youngest of the three girls in the Despicable Me films—to dub Masha. Netflix shows Masha in North America and says it’s considering adding it in other countries.Animaccord doesn’t release details about its finances, but researcher Social Blade estimates the series earns as much as $1.5 million a month from advertising on YouTube. The real money, though, is in licensing, which Animaccord says accounts for about two-thirds of revenue. Loveyko expects retail sales of licensed goods globally to jump next year by about 25 percent, to $300 million, which would mean about $15 million in profit for his company. Last year, Italian confectioner Ferrero sold 37 million chocolate bars with Masha and the Bear on the label in Russia, and Danone sold 33 million licensed yogurts in Ukraine. Burger King has been offering a Masha-branded kids menu in Russia since January, and German toymaker Simba Dickie is introducing Masha-themed plush animals and construction sets. Masha has “proven that it works perfectly for merchandising, not only for toys but apparel, school bags, and sweets,” says Michael Sieber, Simba Dickie’s chief executive officer. “It has great potential. It won’t be just a short hype but a long-term story.”The bottom line: Sales of licensed goods from Masha and the Bear could reach $300 million next year as the Russian cartoon’s popularity soars.'),\n",

       "  'How Hasbro grabbed the lucrative Disney doll business from Mattel.FromJuniper Keithler is 3 years old and wants to be a princess. Her parents aren’t thrilled. “It started a year ago. She went to a friend’s house for a play date and saw the Elsa and Anna dolls, then came home singing Let It Go from Frozen,” says her mother, Athena Lutton Keithler, who lives with her husband and daughter in Denver, along with princess-themed bedsheets, T-shirts, dresses, sleeping bag, lunchbox, and backpack. Juniper would have even more if her parents hadn’t asked family members to stop buying the stuff. Every morning, Juniper asks to wear a princess dress and “loud shoes” with hard plastic heels. When she puts them on, she declares, “I’m becoming a woman!”“I really didn’t think this would happen. She’s not even in preschool yet,” Keithler, 31, sighs. She knew about the so-called princess phase that little girls go through, but, she says, “I assumed it was something girls do when it’s thrust upon them.”Keeping a 3-year-old girl away from Disney’s princesses is a lot like trying to get through January without hearing about the Super Bowl. Since Walt Disney lumped Sleeping Beauty, Belle, and its other poofy-dressed ladies together under the brand Disney Princess in 2000, the market for all things pink and sparkly has skyrocketed. Princess merchandise—dolls, clothing, games, home décor, toys—is a $5.5 billion enterprise and Disney’s second-most-profitable franchise, after Mickey Mouse. (Disney’s new Star Wars movie might change that.) That doesn’t even include Frozen, which came out in 2013 and which Disney measures separately. The movie spawned the top toy brand in the U.S. last year, selling $531 million worth of dolls and dresses, according to NPD Group.Disney doesn’t manufacture most of the Princess products. It licenses them to all sorts of companies: Glidden makes pink and purple wall paint, Stride Rite makes sparkly shoes. In toys, the most lucrative Disney Princess license is dolls. Specifically, 12-inch Barbie-esque figurines that girls can dress and undress until the dolls’ hairdos get tangled, they’ve lost their shoes, and it’s time to buy another.Mattel has worked with Disney since 1955, when it became the first sponsor for the Mickey Mouse Club, and it’s been the company’s go-to dollmaker since 1996. Last year, Mattel put the size of its Disney Princess doll business at $300 million, though analysts at Needham say it’s closer to $500 million. With sales of Mattel’s most famous toy, 56-year-old Barbie, tumbling 20 percent from 2012 to 2014 and still falling, Princess dolls have been a much-needed revenue stream.But not for long: The princess business disappears on Jan. 1, when Disney packs up its glass slippers and takes them to Mattel’s biggest rival, Hasbro. “Disney Princess was probably the greatest coup that Hasbro has had in the last three decades,” says Gene Del Vecchio, a former Ogilvy & Mather executive who has worked with Mattel and Disney in the past and helps Hollywood studios translate their movies into what he calls “merchandise opportunities.” Adweek likens Hasbro’s achievement to the Chicago Cubs winning the World Series.Disney is taking a risk turning to Hasbro. Mattel owns the doll market, and despite her recent stumble, Barbie is still the best-selling doll of all time. Hasbro, meanwhile, has traditionally kept to the boys’ side of the toy aisle, with brands such as Nerf and Transformers. But it has big plans for the princesses. Hasbro and Disney are redesigning and rereleasing every Princess doll, even Pocahontas, which few stores carry. Hasbro hired a few dozen people, mostly designers and developers, who work out of its newly expanded production studio in Burbank, just minutes from Disney. “We’re going to make the Princess brand far bigger and more ubiquitous than it has been in the past,” says Brian Goldner, Hasbro’s chief executive officer. If Athena Keithler thinks she’s got princess overload now, a lot more pink is headed her way.Disney used to market movies, not characters. Jasmine dolls were on store shelves only when Aladdin was out—either during its initial run or when it was rereleased. (The studio releases its animated films for just a few years at a time, then takes them out of rotation to drive up anticipation and demand.)That changed in 2000, when a newly hired Disney executive named Andy Mooney went to a Disney on Ice show in Phoenix. “I saw these girls ages 5 and 7, waiting to go see the show in full regalia—tiara, shoes, the works,” says Mooney, who is now CEO of Fender Musical Instruments. “I asked the mothers, ‘Where did you buy this?’ They said, ‘Well, we had to make this. You don’t sell it.’ I said, ‘If we made this, would you buy it?’ They said, ‘Loads of it.’\\u2009”That year, Disney started selling products that featured all eight princesses, many from movies that weren’t in theaters. Hasbro made games, Mattel made the dolls and plastic Fisher-Price figurines. Disney had never before sold or marketed merchandise picturing princesses from different movies together. “The prevailing wisdom at the studio was that somehow having the princesses gang together would destroy their individual mythology and therefore the value of their films,” says Mooney. To guard against this, Disney invented marketing rules: The princesses couldn’t look at each other. Their dresses had to be different colors. Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella both wore blue, so Sleeping Beauty, marketed under her first name, Aurora, changed into bubble-gum pink.Even with almost no formal marketing plan in place beyond a few toy commercials, the Disney Princess brand surpassed $1 billion in sales within three years. “This was unheard of,” says Mooney. Disney made more movies and now has 11 princesses—13 if you include Elsa and Anna from Frozen. The next, a Polynesian named Moana, will make her debut in her own film next year.As Mattel was raking in money from the princesses, Hasbro underwent a transformation. The company, headquartered in a series of squat buildings in Pawtucket, R.I., hadn’t had a hit since the 1980s, when it came up with Transformers and My Little Pony. During the Pokemon craze, it survived on licensing fees. When that ended, Hasbro found itself selling a bunch of outdated toys. It barely survived a takeover attempt by Mattel in 1996. Transformers, once worth hundreds of millions of dollars, made only $25 million in 2000.“We’d let our brands lie fallow, and were losing a lot of money,” says Goldner, who came to the company that year as Hasbro’s president of U.S. toys and in 2008 became CEO. At 52, with thick brown hair and a youthful face, he has a sense of credibility when he talks about toys, as if he’s not too far removed from childhood himself. “I still remember a conversation about a cost-saving initiative, and someone asked me if we should close the FunLab,” he says, referring to the room at Hasbro’s headquarters where research teams watch children play with toys through a two-way mirror. “I said, we’re not going to close the FunLab, we’re going to use it to build back our own brands.”Goldner sent a team of 25 to travel the country, talking to parents and kids about their toy-shopping habits. They found that children still liked playing with Transformers, they just hadn’t seen them on TV. (The original Transformers series ended in 1987.) The toys they really wanted were all connected to movies and shows. “Kids respond to characters and stories,” says John Frascotti, president of Hasbro’s brand division. If Hasbro wanted to get children to embrace its toys again, it would have to give them something to watch.This wasn’t a new idea. The toy industry has known about the power of movie-based merchandising since 1977, when the first Star Wars came out and Han Solo and Darth Vader action figures became so popular that Kenner Products, a now-defunct toy company, resorted to selling empty boxes with IOUs inside. But what had changed was that toy tie-ins had gone from something associated with a few smash hits to the near-universal requirement that toys come with a movie or TV show. Today, the $23 billion U.S. toy industry fluctuates a few percentage points every year, but sales of toys that don’t have their own movies or shows are flat or declining.“Five years ago I would’ve told you that technology was hurting toys because kids were watching their iPads instead. Now I think it’s helping—even preschoolers are engaging with brands,” says NPD Group’s Juli Lennett. Hasbro stopped calling itself a toy company. Today, executives prefer to describe their business as “creating play experiences.”In 2007, Hasbro co-produced Transformers, directed by Michael Bay, with Paramount Pictures. The movie made $710 million worldwide and was such an astounding hit that Hasbro opened its own film studio in Burbank. It has since made three more Transformers movies, each more successful than the last. Whenever a new one opens, toy sales double. Hasbro transferred a handful of toy designers from Rhode Island to Burbank to “work with the filmmakers to ensure that the characters you see on the screen can be turned into toys,” says Patrick Marr, director for model development. It also collaborated with the Discovery Channel to launch the Hub television network (later Discovery Family) to serve as a home for shows based on its brands. Hasbro used the network to revive My Little Pony. It’s become one of Hasbro’s top-selling lines, with nearly $1 billion in sales last year, thanks to its My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic show.Not everything Hasbro touches has been a hit. Battleship, the 2012 movie based on the game, flopped. Jem and the Holograms, released in October, has yet to earn back its $5 million budget. But the successes have more than offset the bombs.Unlike Hasbro, Mattel didn’t think it needed movies to sell toys. “I wouldn’t say there’s been a major sea change,” says Tim Kilpin, Mattel’s former chief commercial officer, who left the company in November. “The way we were selling toys in the ’70s and ’80s is the way they’re selling toys today.” Talks of a Barbie movie cropped up internally from time to time—Del Vecchio, the former adman, says he saw scripts 15 years ago and once wrote a draft himself—but nothing ever came of it. Instead, Mattel preferred to go small. A 2012 Netflix series starred Barbie and her Dream House, complete with a talking closet. A Barbie YouTube channel posts three-minute videos once a week. None of it’s very good. But it’s safe. “If you make a big movie about Barbie and it bombs, it could have long-term repercussion for Mattel’s toy business,” says Del Vecchio. “You have to be extremely careful with the golden goose.”When Mattel started to make Disney Princess dolls 15 years ago, they came with their own sleek, sparkling movies, and it was basically creating competition for its best-selling brand. It didn’t help that the dolls were the same size and shape as Barbie, giving the impression that Barbie had just gotten a job as a Cinderella or Belle impersonator.Things got more complicated in the late 2000s, when Mattel released a line of princess-themed Barbie DVDs and dolls, essentially pitting them against Disney’s line. When Barbie’s sales started to fall in 2012, she became Mattel’s problem child. “Barbie is going to continue to be a brand that we spend a lot of time and attention on to make sure she [improves],” Mattel’s then-CEO, Bryan Stockton, told investors last year. Mattel’s focus on Disney’s Princesses waned. “Disney essentially said, ‘Yo, Mattel, you have a Barbie problem—in the process of fixing that problem, are you going to [still] pay attention to my brand?’\\u2009” says Sean McGowan, toy analyst at Oppenheimer & Co.In 2013, Disney set up a meeting with Hasbro, which already had Disney’s Star Wars and Marvel licenses, and its FunLab ran regular tests for the company. Before each Star Wars movie, for example, Hasbro tested kids’ familiarity with the franchise. They discovered that parents—“dads mostly,” says Frascotti—passed down their love of Star Wars to their kids in the same way that they taught them which sports teams to root for. “We have a fancy term for it that we made up,” says Frascotti. “We call it trans-generational emotional resonance.” Disney liked Hasbro’s FunLab reports. “They’d seen them work quite well for Star Wars and Marvel,” says Goldner. “Then they asked us what we knew about girls.”Hasbro researchers found that girls—young girls, particularly—weren’t nearly as into clothes and boys and happily-ever-after as they thought. “What we found was that girls loved the idea of a brand that embraced friendship and kindness,” Goldner says. Impressed with Hasbro’s analysis, Disney gave it a small license for Descendants, a made-for-TV movie it was developing about the teenage kids of its princesses.Meanwhile, Mattel made what, in hindsight, seems like a pretty dense move: In 2013 it released its own line of princess-themed dolls, Ever After High. Unless you’re a girl under 10—or the parent of one—you’ve probably never heard of them. Designed to be the teen children of Cinderella, Snow White, Little Red Riding Hood, and other characters, they wear platform shoes, bodices, and short, sometimes see-through skirts: tarted-up versions of Disney’s Princesses. Stephen Sumner, a former Barbie designer now at Hasbro, did early sketches of the line. He says Mattel envisioned a line of witch dolls, then realized another company already had one. “So they had to turn it into princesses, even though there was kind of an overlap,” he says. Because the dolls were based on traditional fairy tales, Mattel didn’t have to pay Disney licensing fees. Disney didn’t like the competition.Several former Mattel employees point to the 2013 release of Ever After High as the last straw for Disney. Chris Sinclair, a Mattel board member who took over as CEO in January, agrees. “We got too competitive with them on Ever After High,” he says. According to Mattel’s annual report, Ever After High accounted for just $53 million in added sales last year.Hasbro was busy working on its Descendants line when Disney called in early 2014 with a new proposal. “They said,” Goldner recalls, “\\u2009‘What would you do if we gave you the entire Disney Princess business?’\\u2009”Disney explained that it was reimagining its princesses. Its license agreement with Mattel was coming up for renewal, and it was shopping for a new dollmaker. The company was starting to hear you’re-sending-the-wrong-message-to-our-daughter complaints from parents. The most biting criticism came from New York Times Magazine writer Peggy Orenstein, author of the 2011 book Cinderella Ate My Daughter. She often opined about the time her daughter’s dentist asked her to sit in his “princess chair” so he could “sparkle” her teeth. “Parents were talking about the ‘princess phase’ as if it were an actual stage of development,” says Orenstein.Disney decided to try to portray the princesses more as heroines than damsels. The company worked with Jess Weiner, a branding consultant who helps companies rethink the way they market to women. “Disney wanted to reach girls and women in more authentic ways,” says Weiner. “We looked at the Princess products. On backpacks and things, these princesses had always been fairly homogenous-looking and in passive poses. Anyone who’s spent time with a 5-year-old knows they’re not into passively posing.” In new movies, Disney was able to create courageous, independent women from scratch. In Frozen, the princess Elsa winds up without a prince. Star Wars: The Force Awakens focuses on a female warrior named Rey, who runs and fights and at no point becomes enslaved in a gold bikini. But the older princesses needed some work. “The Princess franchise has to evolve,” says Josh Silverman, executive vice president for global licensing at Disney Consumer Products, the division that handles all the brand licenses. “The focus will be on empowered heroines.”To win Disney’s Princess license, Hasbro had to figure out how to translate this lofty vision of “empowerment” into a plastic doll. Hasbro’s researchers talked to thousands of girls at the company’s Pawtucket headquarters, as well as in Hong Kong, London, and Los Angeles, and found that girls thought about princesses in much the same way that boys viewed superheroes. Sometimes they liked a character because of her dress; other times they focused on her abilities, such as archery and sword fighting (Merida, from Brave) or the ability to conjure ice and snow (Elsa). “Sometimes they want a prince, sometimes there is no need for a prince,” says Frascotti. Disney didn’t have to reimagine the princesses, it turned out. Girls had already done it themselves. The dolls had just never been marketed like that.“Every girl knows Cinderella, but there are 11 princesses,” says Andrea Hopelain, a former Disney marketing director who’s vice president for global brand strategy at Hasbro. In toy stores today, at the end of Mattel’s reign, the available Disney Princess dolls almost always come from one of four movies: Cinderella, The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, and Frozen. Toys “R” Us’s flagship store in Times Square is 110,000 square feet and sells toys to millions of children every year, but right before Christmas this year, it had only one Tiana toy (Disney’s only African American princess, from The Princess and the Frog). That will change with Hasbro. “We can reintroduce Mulan,” says Hopelain. “We can play up that Tiana is a great cook.”Hasbro’s ideas impressed Disney. “It was pretty late in the game last year when we became aware the loss was a potential,” Sinclair says. “It deteriorated in about three or four weeks.” Disney officially gave the Princess license to Hasbro in September 2014. Mattel is tight-lipped about how and when it found out, but Sinclair was surprised when Stockton, still CEO, called him to say they’d lost the business. “We took Disney for granted. We weren’t focusing on them,” Sinclair says. “Shame on us.”Three months later, Stockton was out and Sinclair was in; one of his first moves was to call Disney and apologize. Disney executives drove across town in Los Angeles to Mattel for several meetings and to see what other toys Mattel had in the works. Since January, two-thirds of Mattel’s senior executives have stepped down or been laid off. “We’ve dealt with it as directly and forthrightly as we can,” Sinclair says. He and Disney insist that their relationship is fine and point out that Mattel still makes toys for other Disney brands, including Mickey Mouse.When Hasbro’s Disney Princess dolls go on sale on Jan. 1, all 11 will be available in toy stores for the first time. The dolls will have different heights and waist sizes (though not by much). Their flawless skin will come in various shades of—well, mostly white—and their facial features have been directly modeled after the characters in the films, not painted on a preexisting mold. Their arms are stiff, and their hair isn’t as easily brushable as Barbie’s, but they’re simpler, cleaner, and easy to tell apart. They look like Disney’s animated characters come to life.These distinctions are subtle, but, Hasbro and Disney hope, they’ll make each princess feel like a fully realized person, not just one of 11 lookalikes separated only by the color of her dress. Hasbro CEO Goldner admits that the first few months of sales will probably be slow as stores discount Mattel’s old dolls to get rid of inventory. “After that, it’s our brand to manage,” he says.Both Hasbro and Disney say they plan to highlight the princesses’ bravery and skills in future advertising, and to give the nonwhite princesses more shelf space. “A 4-year-old girl doesn’t realize how the world she lives in is different from 10 or 15 years ago, but her parents do,” says Frascotti. And parents, he points out, are the ones who buy the toys.Little girls’ worlds will soon be filled with even more dolls and dresses and sparkles and tiaras as Disney churns out more movies and Hasbro makes more toys to go with them. The Frozen sequel, the new Moana movie, and a live-action Beauty and the Beast film are all coming out in the next few years. “I had no idea the princesses would grow into this,” marvels Andy Mooney, who still can’t believe how one trip to a Disney on Ice show could inspire an empire now worth more than the Dallas Cowboys. “The phase when little girls play dress-up is a brief moment in time. But it’s a brief moment in time when they spend a lot of money.”'),\n",

       "  \"A year ago, Kevin Chou decided against an initial public offering for his company, Kabam, which makes smartphone games based on popular Hollywood franchises. Instead, the chief executive officer opted to let employees and early investors sell $40 million worth of stock to investors, a move that didn’t subject Kabam’s finances to public scrutiny on a quarterly basis. “We’ve kind of taken the need for an IPO off the table,” says Chou. It was the second time Kabam had done that in two years.When a startup that’s considered going public decides not to, it’s generally seen as a defeat. But Chou got some validation on Nov. 2, when Activision Blizzard bought King Digital Entertainment, the maker of Candy Crush, for $5.9 billion. While that’s a lot of money, it’s $1.2 billion less than King’s 2014 IPO value. The Activision deal was a reminder of both how big mobile game companies can become and how vulnerable they remain.King is one of the giants of mobile gaming. Almost 500 million people play Candy Crush and related titles, and King has made well over $100 million in profit in each quarter since its IPO. Investors got nervous, though, as the company failed to produce a comparably popular follow-up. Earlier casual-gaming leaders such as Zynga and Rovio have seen their fortunes fall.Mobile gaming has proven lucrative, but that doesn’t mean making lucrative games is easy. Enduring success in the industry requires a steady string of games that reach blockbuster status. “Nobody knows what the formula looks like,” says Chou.For more than six years, Kabam has ridden the waves of the game business. Chou and three co-founders started the company in 2006 as Watercooler, a social network focused on sports. They later switched to developing games for Facebook, then their own site, and eventually shifted their focus to mobile.Kabam’s revenue reached $400 million last year, and the company says it’s been profitable since 2012. Its latest big game is Marvel: Contest of Champions, which sets up fights between superheroes such as Spider-Man and Thor. The game made $100 million within seven months of its December launch and has consistently ranked among the 10 top-grossing iOS games, says researcher App Annie.Licensing popular characters has helped Kabam stand out in a field of hundreds of thousands of games. It’s also forced the company to share revenue with rights holders. And hit movies don’t always make for hit games. Kabam’s recent adaptations of The Lord of the Rings and The Hunger Games never brought in much money, and Kabam’s overall revenue grew only 7 percent in 2014 after doubling the year before. The company declined to provide more recent data.In April, Kabam began to lay off an undisclosed number of its 825 employees. Since then the company has shifted away from publishing other developers’ games, ditched its Web division, and cut the number of titles in development from dozens to just a few. Chief Operating Officer Kent Wakeford says Kabam is no longer interested in making a bevy of marginally profitable games and wants to concentrate its efforts. “It’s riskier if we’re going to launch two to four games a year,” he says. “But do you want 20 games that make $1 million a month or one game that does $100 million a month?”Kabam is also betting big on China, which surpassed the U.S. this year as the biggest market for mobile games—about 420 million people there pay $5.5 billion annually, says researcher Niko Partners. Western gaming companies typically haven’t done well in China, where tastes differ and local gatekeepers dominate access to the market. Kabam, however, has closer ties to China than most rivals do. The company's founders are the children of Chinese immigrants, and they've had a studio in the country for five years. Alibaba invested $120 million in Kabam in July 2014, a deal that valued the company at more than $1 billion.Early next year, Kabam plans to launch a version of Marvel: Contest of Champions tailored for China. Although Kabam has experimented unsuccessfully with Chinese iterations of its games in the past, it’s invested considerably more time and effort this time. Chou says the company paid Marvel parent Walt Disney more to license the characters for use in China than it did for the U.S. version, and it’s dedicated 200 people to localizing the game.Some of the changes are relatively simple, such as reworking the user interface to accommodate text that can be read from top to bottom rather than left to right. The Chinese version will also offer more virtual gear, such as dragons and special weapons, that can be earned through hours of play or bought with real money. Chinese government censorship is also a factor: Games in China can’t show blood unless it’s given an unrealistic color, and resurrection is off-limits.Success in China could raise Contest of Champions into the top stratum of mobile games. Yet even that wouldn’t prove Kabam, or any company that just makes mobile games, can survive on its own, says Santosh Rao, head of research at Manhattan Venture Partners. After Activision bought King, Rao sent a research note to investors saying the industry is ripe for consolidation. In an interview, he says Kabam’s success could make it an acquisition target, and selling out would help the company survive between hits.Like Chou, Rao says it’s a good thing Kabam didn’t push for an IPO. “It would have been a disaster,” he says. “This is a very spotty business. You’re only as good as your last game.”The bottom line: Kabam’s revenue reached $400 million last year, but like most mobile game makers, it’s struggling to build a catalog of hits.(Updated fifth and eighth paragraphs to correct the number of Kabam co-founders)\"),\n",

       "  '2015-11-19',\n",
       "  'The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1, 2014.Lions Gate Entertainment, the largest independent U.S. movie studio, made its name adapting young adult novels into films, including the vampire romance series Twilight and the Divergent sci-fi movies. Now, with the fourth and final installment of its Hunger Games series opening on Nov. 20 in North America, the studio finds itself without an obvious replacement at a time when multifilm franchises have never been more important to Hollywood. “It’s kind of an end of an era,” says Jeff Bock, senior box-office analyst with industry researcher Exhibitor Relations. “There really isn’t a next-in-line yet.”Investors got a taste of that uncertainty on Nov. 9, when Lions Gate reported a surprise loss after its Vin Diesel movie, The Last Witch Hunter, bombed in theaters and forced it to quickly write down the clunker. The next day two companies in cable billionaire John Malone’s empire, Liberty Global and Discovery Communications, agreed to buy 6.8 percent of the studio. That added to the speculation that Lions Gate—which has a growing television business, producing shows such as ABC’s Nashville and Netflix’s Orange Is the New Black—could find itself at the core of a media content consolidation by Malone.The studio is trying hard to hang on to its franchise strategy, which allows subsequent movies to open with a built-in fan base. The third Divergent film will open in March, and a fourth is planned. Almost half of Lions Gate’s release schedule over the next few years is sequels or potential franchise films, including Part 2 of the magician thriller Now You See Me and a second John Wick, an action feature with Keanu Reeves. The studio is making the fantasy film Gods of Egypt and has a Power Rangers picture on tap, based on the 1990s TV series. Lions Gate has also acquired the rights to Chaos Walking, another dystopian book series that’s won a number of children’s book awards in the U.K. All three seem candidates for sequels.Yet none of the studio’s future efforts looks set to equal the Hunger Games films, which have generated $2.3 billion in theaters worldwide, according to researcher Box Office Mojo. “They’ve made a lot of money from the Hunger Games franchise, but that profit largely comes to an end next year,” says Doug Creutz, a Cowen analyst. To make matters worse, “there are only more competitors trying to do the same as Lions Gate.”Other studios that have piled onto the young adult bus have had mixed results. 20th Century Fox had a hit with its 2014 film The Maze Runner—yet another young adult book-turned-movie about teenagers in peril in a dark futuristic world. The film grossed $348 million globally, and a second installment in September brought in almost $310 million, according to Box Office Mojo. A third in the series is planned for 2017. But Fox’s Me and Earl and the Dying Girl failed to deliver results like last year’s low-budget hit The Fault in Our Stars, taking in only $9 million worldwide this summer. Warner Bros.’ Beautiful Creatures in 2013 didn’t cover its $60 million production budget. In January, Sony will release The 5th Wave, born of another young adult sci-fi book trilogy.Industry consultant Russell Schwartz, co-principal at Pandemic Marketing and a former marketing executive at New Line Cinema who worked on the Lord of the Rings trilogy, says studios are finding it harder to grab the attention of younger viewers. “This audience is getting more discerning,” Schwartz says. “They are just not running after everything. It’s not as dependable an audience anymore.”But analysts say Lions Gate has benefited from acquiring strong source material to turn into movies. “Management believes that Lions Gate is still the first destination for authors with new storylines,” says Eric Wold, an analyst at B. Riley. “And we believe that as long as there are young adults seeing movies, there will be an audience for young adult films.”Lions Gate’s new Hunger Games film, Mockingjay Part 2, is expected to pull in $320 million in North American revenue for its full theatrical release, the least of all the films in the series, estimates BoxOffice.com. One possible problem this time around: high public interest in Walt Disney’s new Star Wars film, The Force Awakens, which opens a month later.On a Nov. 10 analysts call, Chief Executive Officer Jon Feltheimer trimmed his long-term profit outlook for Lions Gate, citing the disappointing performance of its recent films and pushed-back release dates for future movies. The company now forecasts $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization from 2015 through 2017—down about $100 million from earlier projections.That’s hardly a disaster, says B. Riley’s Wold. Besides, he says, the company likely isn’t done with the characters that attracted young moviegoers to the tale of a future where teens fight to the death on national television, pitting survival against love. Feltheimer hinted as much earlier this year during an analysts call. “It’s pretty clear there is a prequel of The Hunger Games on the horizon,” Wold says, “and I think if that gets confirmed and announced, then a lot of people’s concerns about this cliff change pretty quickly.” The company declined to make executives available for interviews.Lions Gate is also trying to extend the life of The Hunger Games by licensing the name for theme park attractions in Dubai, Atlanta, and China—an opportunity the company sees adding as much as $100 million in profit over the long term. But some analysts have doubts. Says Cowen’s Creutz: “It’s hard to imagine a Hunger Games theme park as a fun destination.”The bottom line: The Hunger Games films have $2.3 billion in ticket sales—so far. But as the series ends, studio Lions Gate’s next move is uncertain.'),\n",

       "  '2015-11-18',\n",
       "  \"At the NFL owners’ meetings at the Waldorf Astoria New York in October, reporters are kept in a hallway behind velvet ropes. They wait all day for anything they can get.“You guys are in the pen? What’s going on over here?” NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell says as he walks by in the morning.“You make the rules,” says one reporter.“I didn’t make those rules,” Goodell says over his shoulder.Now and again, an owner, this time Jerry Jones of the Dallas Cowboys, leaves the ballroom where the meeting is and walks down the hall to the men’s room at the other end. “Mr. Jones? Jerry?” the reporters plead. “Do you have a minute?”Jones stops, and a scrum forms. Nobody has to say what everybody wants to know: What’s the latest on Los Angeles? “We have the opportunity to do something special,” Jones says, before ambling away. The reporters huddle to parse his words. He must mean the Stan Kroenke plan.The National Football League wants to put at least one franchise in Los Angeles by the start of next season. Kroenke, the owner of the St. Louis Rams and arguably the most powerful owner in sports, wants it to be his. He’s ready to build a $1.9 billion stadium southwest of downtown. He has big backers. Jones, who built an 80,000-seat cathedral to excess known as “Jerry’s World” for his Cowboys in 2009, admires the grandeur of Kroenke’s plan and has sided with him against owners from the San Diego Chargers and Oakland Raiders, who want to build and share a stadium in the L.A. suburb of Carson, bringing two franchises to the city at once. Jones’s tossed-off comment about “something special” is the tiniest scrap, but when you’re covering Kroenke, that feels like a meal. He seldom gives interviews.Kroenke (pronounced Kron-key) is one of the wealthiest and least-known owners in professional sports. He’s a Missouri-born (full name: Enos Stanley, after St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Famers Enos Slaughter and Stan Musial) real estate developer who’s married to a Wal-Mart heiress. At the Waldorf, he looks trim and fit for 68 years old. He’s wearing a dark suit, black tie, and white shirt with matching pocket square. His chevron mustache and sideways flop of hair are graying. At one point, in what passes for tweet-worthy news, he exits the restroom with Clark Hunt, owner of the Kansas City Chiefs and one of the members of the NFL committee overseeing the Los Angeles bids. As usual, he ignores the reporters. He didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment on this story.According to the website for his project, billed as the City of Champions Revitalization, Kroenke aims to turn a demolished horse racing track and parking lot in Inglewood, Calif., into an 80,000-seat stadium with a latticed open-air roof; an adjacent 6,000-seat arena; 1.7 million square feet of retail and office space; 2,500 residential units; and a hotel. To put the Rams there, he’ll have to secure the approval of at least 24 of 31 of his fellow NFL owners and give a stiff arm to his native Missouri. Everything in Kroenke’s past suggests he will find a way. “If it can get done, he’ll get it done,” says Jim Gordon, a longtime business partner. The move would almost instantly create one of the most valuable teams in football. Kroenke’s first attempt to land a franchise in the National Football League was a dud. In 1993, St. Louis was one of five cities bidding to become home to a new NFL team. A group of investors backing the St. Louis Stallions, as they planned to call the team, fell apart a few days before formal presentations to the league owners in Chicago. Kroenke, then a little-known strip mall developer said to be worth a half-billion dollars, stepped in to lead the bid. He went before the owners with Richard Gephardt (D-Mo.), then the U.S. House Majority leader, Jack Buck, the play-by-play man for the St. Louis Cardinals baseball team, and Dan Dierdorf, who’d played for the St. Louis Cardinals—the NFL team—before they moved to Phoenix in 1988.Kroenke’s performance that day was memorably forgettable. “I don’t even know that he said anything,” Gephardt recalls. “He may have.” A league source told the Philadelphia Inquirer that Kroenke was “evocative of the cartoon character Droopy Dog.” The owners chose Charlotte, N.C., for a new team that day and, five weeks later, selected Jacksonville, Fla., for the second expansion slot.The city of St. Louis then went shopping for a team to fill the domed football stadium it was already building. The Rams, who had been in Los Angeles since 1946, accepted a sweetheart deal to move in. Kroenke offered to purchase a stake in the team. The NFL approved the move in 1995, and he became a minority owner. In 2010, after the death of longtime owner Georgia Frontiere, Kroenke exercised his option to buy the available 60 percent share of the franchise for $450 million. “It’s exciting to be a 17-year overnight success,” he joked at a news conference.Kroenke, as the NFL learned, specializes in slogs. For him, deals are like fence posts. “You’ve just got to pound on them,” Gordon recalls him saying. “You pound on it, pound on it, pound on it, and then all of a sudden it actually goes down.” In this way, Kroenke has built a fortune worth $5.6 billion, according to Bloomberg estimates. It includes 20 million square feet of retail property, more than a million acres of ranchland, a pair of California wineries, and a sports portfolio to rival any in the world. Along with the Rams, Kroenke owns the National Basketball Association’s Denver Nuggets, the National Hockey League’s Colorado Avalanche, Major League Soccer’s Colorado Rapids, and two-thirds of the English Premier League soccer club Arsenal—all separate from his wife Ann’s $2.4 billion inheritance.    Stan met Ann on a ski trip to Aspen, Colo., in 1971. He was a student at the University of Missouri. She was in nursing school. His father ran a rural lumberyard. Hers was James “Bud” Walton, co-founder, with his brother, Sam, of Wal-Mart Stores. Stan grew up in Mora, Mo., a town of fewer than 500 people southeast of Kansas City. Ann was from Versailles, Mo., 25 miles east. They were married three years later. Bud, who handled the real estate side of Wal-Mart, brought Stan into the family business. He took his son-in-law on visits to potential sites and introduced him to Raul Walters, a Missouri developer who had helped build some of the company’s earliest stores. “I chose to work for basically nothing to learn the business because I thought I would be good at it, and it turned out I was very good at it,” Kroenke once told Bloomberg. In 1979, Walters and Kroenke became partners. Together they built 20 strip malls across the Midwest, many of them anchored by a Wal-Mart.When Bud died in 1995, he left half of his 40 million Wal-Mart shares to Ann, his eldest daughter. That year, Stan took a seat on the Wal-Mart board. Under pressure from labor groups concerned about insider dealing, the retailer had begun disclosing its commercial relationship with Kroenke four years prior. By 2001, when Kroenke left the board and the disclosures stopped, he was the landlord for 55 Wal-Mart and Sam’s Club stores. Over the decade, he collected $150 million in rents and fees from the company, always with the assurance that the price was “competitive with amounts that would be paid to a third party to lease similar space.”Curtis Barlow, a former lawyer for Wal-Mart’s real estate division, thought otherwise about a 1991 deal with Kroenke to build a Sam’s Club in Dallas. Barlow told the Washington Post that Wal-Mart was paying almost double market price for the space. “I just didn’t feel that it was right, and being that was a publicly traded company, it shouldn’t continue to treat family members with special concessions,” he told the paper. Wal-Mart said it made a competitive deal. (Barlow, who left the company after the dispute rather than accept a demotion, declined to comment.)David Glass, the chief executive officer of Wal-Mart from 1988 to 2000 and now owner of the Kansas City Royals, denies that Kroenke received any favorable treatment as a developer and says real estate wasn’t discussed in front of Kroenke during board meetings. “In fact, because he was Bud’s son-in-law, he got treated worse than the others,” Glass says. “We held him to a more demanding standard simply because of who he was.” Wal-Mart, he adds, benefited from Kroenke’s skill: “He did a lot of the legwork and got us into areas ahead of when we could have gotten into them by ourselves.”Wal-Mart is a touchy subject for Kroenke. In the few interviews he’s given over the years, he emphasizes the industrious habits he picked up as a child sweeping the shop floor at his father’s lumberyard and the entrepreneurial chops he showed as a college student. In the late ’60s, he started work at Ladigo of London, a clothing shop a few blocks north of the University of Missouri in Columbia that sold bell-bottoms and flowered shirts to students. Kroenke, by his account in the Columbia Daily Tribune, worked there as an undergrad, borrowed $2,000 from his father and MasterCard to buy a piece of the business, and sold it a couple years later at a profit.“It’s hard to challenge his business acumen,” says Scott Rosner, a professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania who’s followed Kroenke’s career closely. “That said, he has a significant advantage based on his family ties.”“I’m not going to argue with people who want to paint me with that brush,” Kroenke once told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.  In Denver, Kroenke bigfooted his brother-in-law, Bill Laurie, who’s married to Ann’s younger sister, Nancy. In 1999 the Lauries almost bought the Denver Nuggets, the Colorado Avalanche, and the Pepsi Center from Ascent Entertainment Group for $400 million. They’d already held a news conference announcing the purchase when it fell apart over a lawsuit filed by Ascent shareholders. Kroenke came in a year later with the winning $450 million bid.When Kroenke first began buying shares in Arsenal in 2007, Peter Hill-Wood, then chairman of the London soccer club, tried to tell the Yankee to go home. “We don’t need Kroenke’s money and we don’t want his sort,” Hill-Wood said to the Guardian. “I don’t know for certain if Kroenke will mount a hostile takeover for our club, but we shall resist it with all our might.” Kroenke was undaunted by the Churchillian resolve and continued to snap up shares of the privately held club, becoming majority owner in 2011.Kroenke frequently brings the with-us-or-against-us mentality of sports into his business relationships. He broke from his mentor Walters in 1985. It took the two nearly a decade in court to divide their holdings. Kroenke accused Walters of misrepresenting assets. Walters, who died in 2009, said Kroenke didn’t do his share of the work. The pattern repeated with Michael Staenberg. Kroenke and Staenberg formed THF Realty (the acronym for “To Have Fun”) in 1990 and, over the next 21 years, built more than 125 strip malls, about half with Wal-Mart as a tenant. The two split in 2011 and are in court in Missouri over how to divvy up an almost 20 million-square-foot retail empire.Things ended poorly for Jim Alabach, who worked for Kroenke for 28 years, beginning as an intern in 1985 and eventually rising to development manager at the Kroenke Group. Alabach helped find land, secure permits, and build stores. When he decided to leave two years ago, he and Kroenke shared ownership in three buildings in downtown Columbia, Mo. In 2011, the two borrowed $5.4 million from a local bank to finance the properties. After Alabach left, according to legal filings in a dispute between the two, Kroenke stopped making payments and, instead of renewing the loan or agreeing to sell the buildings and pay it off, he bought the loan from the bank, declared default, and demanded that Alabach pay the remaining $5 million in debt, plus $250,000 in late penalties—hardball tactics that may prove perfectly legal. The money was inconsequential to Kroenke, but potentially ruinous for Alabach. Inflicting harm, Alabach alleges in a breach-of-contract suit, was the point. “You can’t be in business with people like that,” Alabach’s attorney writes of Kroenke. Kroenke’s attorney didn’t respond to requests for comment.“I don’t know exactly what triggers those to make that happen,” Gordon says of the ugly splits with Walters, Staenberg, and Alabach. Gordon, a Missouri native whose grandmother was a close friend to Sam and Bud Walton’s father, Thomas, has worked with Kroenke for 30 years. He’s a partner in dozens of strip malls and apartment complexes owned by Kroenke-Gordon-Schaller Properties. “He’s always been a big brother to me and taught me a lot of things,” Gordon says of Kroenke. “It’s been cordial, and I hope it stays that way.”  In St. Louis, the relationship between the city and Kroenke is all but over. When Mayor Francis Slay calls, Kroenke doesn’t answer. “Every attempt we have made to contact him has been met with silence,” says Slay’s spokeswoman, Maggie Crane. Kroenke hasn’t made any public comments about his plans for the Rams. The team didn’t respond to requests for comment.Missouri and St. Louis paid dearly to lure the Rams from Los Angeles in 1995. Through a joint city, county, and state body called the St. Louis Convention & Visitors Center (CVC), they funded the construction of the $260 million Edward Jones Dome and leased it to the Rams for just $250,000 per year. In the 30-year lease, the CVC promised to keep the stadium among the top quarter of facilities around the league by standards that left plenty of room for argument. Over the next two decades, all but two of the NFL’s other 31 teams built or renovated stadiums. (One of the holdouts, the Atlanta Falcons, broke ground on a new home last year.) St. Louis, meanwhile, struggled to cover basic upkeep costs at Edward Jones.As the deadline approached for a check on the stadium’s standing on quality this spring, the city and team had very different ideas of what it would take to crack the NFL’s top eight. Kroenke and the Rams proposed a $700 million renovation that called for a bigger footprint, a sliding roof, and a glass wall on one side. The CVC offered to cover half the $124 million cost of a new scoreboard and upgraded luxury seating. In February 2013, a panel of arbitrators said the city’s plan wasn’t enough to meet the standard. The CVC declined to pay for more, triggering an out clause in the lease. A year after the ruling, Kroenke alerted the NFL that he had bought a key 60-acre plot in Inglewood, Calif. Wal-Mart was the seller.The L.A. stadium plan fits Kroenke’s style. He likes to own teams the way he owns strip malls: from the ground up. “He certainly understands the adage that God isn’t making any more land,” says Marc Ganis, president of the consulting firm SportsCorp and a friend to many NFL owners, including Kroenke.In Los Angeles, the Rams would be the centerpiece of a 300-acre mixed-use development. By Ganis’s reckoning, that would double the cash value of the franchise, which Bloomberg estimates to be worth $800 million in St. Louis. A large part of that windfall would have to be paid to the league’s other owners, who are expected to collect a relocation fee in the hundreds of millions, either upfront or through profit-sharing. The league, according to Sports Business Journal, also plans to collect a “flip tax” from any franchise that moves to Los Angeles and then sells within a set period.The league aims to be ready to hold a vote among its ownership sometime in January, with the hope of moving a team or teams to a temporary venue in Los Angeles for the start of next season. That will require getting 24 owners to agree on whether to move two teams or one, how to fund a new stadium, which market or markets to abandon, and, trickiest of all, which of their fellows to back. “Anybody who tells you they know what it’s going to be is simply blowing smoke,” Ganis says. At the Waldorf, the owners spend the afternoon in a briefing from the league on Los Angeles. Like his rivals, Chairman Dean Spanos of the San Diego Chargers and Mark Davis of the Oakland Raiders, Kroenke has to leave the ballroom at the end of the day during the open discussion of their competing interests.The NFL prefers to reward cities and states that help pay for their facilities and punish those that don’t. For the past two decades, an empty Los Angeles has been a powerful bargaining chip for a small-market owner trying to extract concessions. Owner after owner, either openly or in veiled terms, has threatened to move there unless they get public money for a new stadium. Smaller cities, afraid of a blow to their self-image, usually go along. St. Louis and the state of Missouri, after saying no to Kroenke in a rare display of prudence, are scrambling to come up with $388 million to help build a $1 billion stadium for the Rams on the Mississippi riverfront. San Diego is likewise dangling $350 million in taxpayer money toward a $1.1 billion stadium. Oakland, so far, is offering nothing but the fervor of its fans.Kroenke is in the awkward position of rooting against his home state’s efforts to hand him money. His job is to convince other owners, especially the six-member Committee on Los Angeles Opportunities, that the St. Louis bid isn’t viable and can be rejected without setting the wrong precedent. State legislators in Missouri are helping his cause by demanding that either they or the public get a chance to vote on the stadium proposal. Eric Grubman, the NFL executive overseeing the bid process, told reporters in November that he wasn’t confident the St. Louis plan, as it stood, could win the support of NFL owners.Charm offensives aren’t Kroenke’s strength. In the old boys’ club that is the NFL, San Diego’s Spanos carries greater sway. But Kroenke’s deep pockets, and the simplicity of his plan, may win the day. Spanos and Davis are looking to share the L.A. market with each other. Kroenke wants it to himself. And he has the resources to finance a stadium with minimal debt load. The two-team plan comes with a bigger marketing challenge. “They would have to go out and sell season tickets at the same time and build a fan base and sell sponsorships,” says Sal Galatioto, president of Galatioto Sports Partners, a consultant to franchises. On the flip side, two teams would play twice as many home games and share the burden of paying down the cost of a stadium, which Galatioto estimates will be about $40 million a year in debt service.Kroenke at the Waldorf Astoria during a break in the NFL owners’ meetings.The only hint of Kroenke’s prospects to come out of the proceedings at the Waldorf is news that the league had approved his plan to transfer ownership of the Denver Nuggets and Colorado Avalanche to a family trust run by his son, Josh. When Kroenke became majority owner of the Rams in 2010, he got a temporary waiver from the NFL to maintain his stakes in the two Denver teams. The league forbids its owners from holding an MLB, NBA, or NHL team in a market where a competing NFL team operates. Denver Broncos owner Pat Bowlen, in this thinking, shouldn’t be battling with Kroenke for mindshare in Denver. Since 2010, as a compromise with the NFL, Kroenke has let Josh speak for the Nuggets and Avalanche among NBA and NHL owners. Now Stan will also move his equity in those teams into his son’s name. Stan’s ability to hang onto his Denver teams reportedly had been a source of grievance among other owners. The transfer of the Denver teams to Josh might help mollify them, though it still leaves the elder Kroenke as the hidden hand there.In November, the Spanos team named Walt Disney CEO Bob Iger as nonexecutive chairman of their stadium project. Disney, through ESPN, owns the rights to Monday Night Football, and Iger is a friend of Commissioner Goodell. In return for Iger’s help, Spanos and Davis have offered him a chance to buy a stake in one of the two teams. Iger’s tenure at Disney is scheduled to end in 2018, and he may need something to do. Iger brings deep connections in the sports and entertainment industries and precisely the sort of polish that Kroenke lacks. If Kroenke moves the Rams to the center of the celebrity-industrial complex—jilting his home state in the process—he will have to work harder than ever to stay out of the spotlight. Los Angeles, after all, is where the Clippers’ new owner, Steve Ballmer, dances for the cameras at almost every home game. “There are a number of owners in professional sports who really like being in the limelight and being out front. And good for them if that’s what they like,” says Glass. “Professional sports are all about the players. It’s not about ownership, and it’s not about the front office or anything else.\\u2006… I share Stan’s view on that.”Kroenke, who tried and failed to buy the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2012, seems to love winning more than he hates attention. In the summer of 1997, he was determined to dunk a basketball on his 50th birthday. “He would practice day in and day out for that,” says a former business partner, who asked to remain anonymous. The 6-foot-2-inch Kroenke, who once scored a record 33 points for his high school team, did dunk on the day, according to the former partner: “He had to win at running. He had to win at basketball. Whatever he played, he had to always win.”—With Matthew Boyle(Update: After publication, a spokesman for Kroenke told Bloomberg Businessweek that Kroenke owns an additional 23 million square feet of retail property and three California wineries not included in Bloomberg’s estimate of his wealth. The spokesman also said that Ann Kroenke inherited half of her father's stake in Wal-Mart, not 75 percent, a figure Bloomberg had estimated from disclosures in the company's SEC filings.

       "  'An Oculus Rift virtual-reality headset.Ever since Facebook paid $2 billion for virtual-reality startup Oculus last year, technophiles have debated the relative merits of the VR gear that will be available in 2016 from the Facebook unit (the Rift headset), Samsung (Gear VR, which works with a smartphone), and Google (Cardboard). Yet success for the new medium may hinge on something far more conventional: the content that will be watched on the devices.As the video game industry learned long ago, buzz around a Mario Bros. or Halo title can speed a tech product’s adoption. Video games will spur early sales of the Rift, Oculus says, but mass adoption of the technology may depend on Hollywood. “Over the next year, you’ll see something come along that defines storytelling in virtual reality,” says Robert Stromberg, co-founder and chief creative officer of Virtual Reality Co. “I have enough years under my belt in visual effects and filmmaking that I see a new medium being born.”A VR experience drops viewers into the middle of the world of the film. Rather than watching from afar, you feel like a character who can interact with everyone around you.Stromberg, who won Oscars for Best Art Direction for both Avatar and Alice in Wonderland, recently worked with director Ridley Scott to craft a VR experience set in the world of his movie The Martian. The project, which places viewers in the environment of the film but isn’t part of the movie, will be released for headsets next year. Stromberg’s company is also working on an untitled virtual-reality project with Steven Spielberg.Hollywood studios are kicking VR’s tires in hopes that its appeal could someday rival that of 3D or IMAX. Lions Gate Entertainment and 21st Century Fox have agreed to sell movies via Oculus’s online store, and Netflix will make its streaming service available on VR headsets. Oculus plans to unveil similar deals closer to the early-2016 Rift launch, according to Chief Executive Officer Brendan Iribe.Those deals cover traditional 2D movies and TV shows that can be viewed wearing a headset. Despite the enveloping experience, it’s not much different than watching on an ordinary television. Studios’ next step is producing or funding cinematic VR—truly immersive, interactive, short-form virtual reality designed specifically for the medium.A VR experience can cost from $250,000 to seven figures to produce, but last just a few minutes. A complete blockbuster film could cost $100 million—an amount no studio would probably commit until there’s a proven audience and business model for the technology.For now, Hollywood is experimenting. Along with its project for The Martian, Fox has commissioned a VR package tied to its movie Wild. While the Wild project is limited to three degrees of motion (viewers can move up and down, left or right, or tilt forward or back), the Martian experience allows for parallax—six degrees of motion—more like the real world. Users could also affect the virtual environment, standing in the shoes of Mark Watney, the character played by Matt Damon.The studio will sell the 15- to 20-minute VR tie-in in time for the Rift’s debut. Fox has yet to set an amount, but it will be “accessibly priced,” says Mike Dunn, president of 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment. (Analysts predict VR content will initially be priced higher than MP3s, but well below video games, which offer far more playtime.) For Fox, VR is not a gimmick or marketing addendum to a film, but the studio’s No. 1 priority in home entertainment, Dunn says. Walt Disney’s Industrial Light & Magic is also working on a VR tie-in for its Star Wars update.“We’re in conversations with all the studios about creating content, and the first question, whether it’s an executive, producer, movie star, or director, is: ‘What are the eyeballs?’\\u200a” says Bryan Besser, an agent at Verve Talent & Literary Agency who represents VR filmmakers, including Felix Lajeunesse and Paul Raphaël. Oculus has commissioned the pair to produce original series for the Rift. And the duo’s VR videos include a five-part series with LeBron James as he prepares for the basketball season and a video of a trip to Africa by Bill Clinton, where viewers “sit” in the room as he talks with poor families. “The holy grail—what everyone is about—is original, nonbranded content,” Besser says. “Everybody wants it, but nobody wants to pay for it.”—With Anousha Sakoui'),\n",

       "  'Maker’s Row co-founders Matthew Burnett and Tanya MenendezNew Englander Spencer Hirst had been living near Jackson Hole for a few years when he hit on the idea for a line of what he calls “mountain formal attire” that could piggyback on the Wyoming resort area’s thriving wedding business. Coming up with designs for bow ties and other accessories turned out to be the easy part, says Hirst, whose Western Range line will go on sale in November on his website and at local boutiques. “Fashion is tough,” he says, “because no one really wants to tell you where they’re getting their stuff made.”Then Hirst found Maker’s Row, an online directory that contains profiles of some 8,000 manufacturers, all in the U.S. Browsing the site, he came across a listing for Genil Accessories, a garment factory in Brooklyn, N.Y., that turns out ties, pocket squares, scarves, and similar items. Its profile on Maker’s Row included a video of founder Gina Bhim. Hirst was impressed: In late July, he placed his first order for 250 bow ties and 250 neckties with Genil.On Maker’s Row, manufacturers get a basic listing for free or pay about $50 a month for more elaborate profile pages that may include photos of finished products and video tours of factories; $200 a month buys priority placement in search results. Registered users—the site has 80,000—get basic manufacturer information for free or pay $20 a month, like Hirst does, for access to a detailed search feature, customer reviews, and direct factory contacts. The Brooklyn-based company that runs the site wouldn’t disclose how many paid subscribers it has or whether the business is profitable.Co-founders Matthew Burnett and Tanya Menendez, a couple, say Maker’s Row was inspired by a problem not unlike Hirst’s. Burnett, a New York-based veteran of Marc Jacobs and DKNY, started his own watch brand in 2007. Yet his small business had little leverage with the huge Asian factories filling his orders. One manufacturing snafu cost him $40,000. For startups, he says, “there is no red carpet overseas.”Burnett switched to leather goods but struggled to find domestic factories to handle growing demand for his company’s wallets, belts, and accessories. “We knocked on doors, cold-called, even checked the Yellow Pages,” says Menendez, who was working at Goldman Sachs at the time. She came up with the idea for a site that would help connect designers with American manufacturers.Digital tools ranging from crowdfunding sites to online storefronts have opened paths for independent designers. While some fairly well-known brands such as Shinola and Brooklyn Industries have turned to Maker’s Row to source production, many of the site’s users are 9-to-5ers with ideas for products but no road map for how to turn them into a business. The registration-and-fee structure helps weed out the frivolous, Menendez says.To guide more committed newbies, Maker’s Row also offers educational content, including a free six-week online course called Production 101. The 25-person company has opened an online store showcasing the wares of its designers. It’s also piloting a payment system that factories could use for billing. “We’re joining an ecosystem that’s lowering barriers for small and medium-size businesses,” Burnett says.Many American manufacturers want to diversify their client base and have learned that means getting online. At MCM Enterprise, a cut-and-sew operation housed in a 20,000-square-foot space in the Gowanus area of Brooklyn, Chief Financial Officer Chung Yu talks about how the recession underscored the risk of relying on a small number of big clients. MCM is using Maker’s Row to get its name out, he says, “like a form of advertising.”The Made in America emphasis has turned Maker’s Row into a darling of politicians. Democratic Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey helped shepherd a slew of Newark factories into the database. Burnett and Menendez were invited to take part in a Maker Faire hosted by the White House last year.Genil Accessories was down to just two workers after being battered by the recession when Burnett and Menendez came knocking in 2012. Now it has 13. Showing a visitor around a loftlike space crammed with sewing machines and bolts of fabric, owner Bhim points out orders in progress for recognizable names—Cole Haan, Walt Disney, Vineyard Vines—as well as upstarts like Hirst. A few days later, the first shipment of Western Range bow ties, with a distinctive stylized antler pattern, arrived at the designer’s door. He pronounced them “absolutely stunning.”The bottom line: The Maker’s Row website has 80,000 registered users, some of whom pay fees to access in-depth profiles of U.S. manufacturers.'),\n",

       "  'Prady with his stars.It’s a few weeks before the new sitcom The Muppets airs on ABC, and Bill Prady, its co-creator and executive producer, is on the set, watching Gonzo rehearse his lines. The show is a behind-the-scenes look at the Muppets’ private life as they produce a late-night talk show, much in the same style as 30 Rock. In today’s scene, Gonzo’s computer crashes. When the IT guy, Chip—a new Muppet—goes to fix it, he discovers that Gonzo has been catfishing women by posing online as the actor Liam Hemsworth.“Even I know that won’t work, and my entire life consists of two dates with a cashier from Walgreens,” Chip says. Prady frowns. “That’s an unnecessary jab at women who work at Walgreens,” he says. Prady, 55, has a large head, close-cropped hair, and a wide, thin mouth that makes him look a bit like one of the Muppets he’s filming—specifically Chip, who was modeled after Prady.They reshoot the scene. Dave Goelz, who’s been voicing Gonzo since 1976 and is manning both puppets, tries another joke for Chip: “My entire love life consists of going to the prom with my mother.”“Sister!” Prady suggests.PHOTOGRAPHER: JULIAN BERMAN FOR BLOOMBERG BUSINESSWEEKGoelz tries it. Then aunt. Then grandmother. Sometimes Chip stares at Gonzo with his mouth open and eyes closed. Then Goelz gives him an overbite. He makes Chip snort when he laughs. He keeps trying things, and the scene takes an hour to film. It ends up being largely improvised, which is the way Goelz usually works. In the end, Chip’s dating experience is reduced to “an inappropriately long handshake with a Jehovah’s Witness.” Prady finally laughs.The Muppets debut on Sept. 22 marks the first time in two decades that Jim Henson’s famous characters—Kermit, Fozzie Bear, Miss Piggy—will star in their own prime-time TV show. It’s been more than 30 years since they did so successfully. Their most famous outing, a comedy-variety act called The Muppet Show, went off the air in 1981. ABC tried to revive the concept with Muppets Tonight in 1996, but it lasted less than one season.Getting these characters back on TV has been Prady’s white whale. He’s been pushing Walt Disney, which owns the characters, to make a sitcom for years. “The Muppets have long been an afterthought [for Disney],” says James Marsh, a senior research analyst at Piper Jaffray Investment Research, who covers Disney. “They’ve owned the Muppets for a decade, and only now are they trying to monetize that.” Kermit the Frog may be iconic, but at a company that also owns Pixar, Star Wars, and Marvel, he’ll never be a top priority.Prady’s Muppet obsession dates to 1983, when Henson gave him his first writing job: lines for Rowlf the Dog to read at a U.S. Postal Service event. He was just starting to write for shows such as Fraggle Rock when his mentor died in 1990. Prady left the company a year later but still tears up when he talks about Henson. He even owns a DVD of his funeral—complete with Muppet eulogy—that he’s never been able to watch.“I’ve had great teachers in my career, but my first, best teacher in all of this was Jim Henson,” he says. So, if anything, he wants to ensure his new show has the same feel as Henson’s work. Prady is using the same puppeteers and the same puppets, and he’s modeled Kermit’s office on the show after Henson’s. “If this only lasts one season, I will be incredibly grateful,” he says. “I will have done what I’ve always wanted to do.”Fortunately, The Muppets has the potential to be the rare network show that, despite television’s fractured state, manages to draw a solid, mainstream audience. “ABC’s good at family programming—Modern Family, Black-ish, even Roseanne a long time ago,” says Brad Adgate, research director at Horizon Media. “The audience for The Muppets is exactly that audience.” The network was also the only one last year to add 18- to 49-year-old viewers, primarily through its classic half-hour sitcoms. The Muppets may expand it even more. The network’s first ad for the show has been viewed 1.2 million times on YouTube. USA Today and People are reporting on Kermit and Miss Piggy, who have split up, as if they’re an actual celebrity couple. Disney is already planning a live Muppet performance for one of its theme parks. New merchandise will likely follow.But getting the Muppets back on TV hasn’t been easy, despite it being their native medium. Henson first created them in the 1950s. They appeared on commercials and late-night variety shows, which drew adult audiences. The characters kept up with the times; by the 1970s, they were making sexual innuendos and contemplating their own mortality on The Muppet Show.Disney’s “owned the muppets for a decade, and only now are they trying to monetize that.”Since Henson’s death, the Muppets have been passed around like foster children. They were almost bought by Disney in 1992, then sold to a German broadcasting company instead for $680 million in 2000. Henson’s heirs bought them back for a tenth of that, then sold them to Disney in 2004 for $75 million. For almost a decade, Disney considered the Muppets to be a line of children’s characters—Prady blames Henson’s Sesame Street characters and the 1984 cartoon series Muppet Babies. “The guy who was in charge of Baby Einstein had the Muppets added to his bailiwick,” Prady says. “That tells you what Disney thought of them.”That mindset has been Prady’s biggest roadblock. The first time he pitched a reboot, in 2006, he made a 10-minute mockumentary about the puppets’ private life. They drank. They dated each other. Disney hated it. “I was literally told to destroy every copy I have,” he says. Instead, Prady focused on The Big Bang Theory, which he co-created. It was the second-most popular show on television last year, behind only Sunday Night Football.Then, earlier this decade, “there was a decision to relaunch the Muppets as an adult franchise in a big way,” says Debbie McClellan, vice president of the Muppets Studio at Disney. “But through film first.” Her studio released 2011’s The Muppets, a musical starring Jason Segel and Amy Adams, which pulled in $165 million worldwide. Even then, the characters were considered child-friendly. When Disney released the more mature Muppets Most Wanted in 2014, critics didn’t know what to make of it. “Grown-up jokes\\u2009…\\u2009make you wonder about the movie’s target audience,” one critic noted in the New York Times.The second movie didn’t do as well, making $80 million, but it altered Disney’s perception of the brand. Last year the company added the Muppets to its new media division, which told Prady it might be interested in his old idea if he repitched it. Soon after, the company took the concept to Netflix, before ABC—also owned by Disney—stepped in. The network bought the show immediately after a meeting last March.Prady assumed ABC would follow the standard production calendar, meaning he’d produce a pilot for 2016’s fall TV season. Instead, the network—which declined to make executives available for an interview—wanted a complete Muppet sitcom ready to go in six months. Prady hired a showrunner, Bob Kushell, who worked on Anger Management, a Charlie Sheen sitcom. Together they developed the Muppets’ grown-up world. “They’re in their 30s and 40s and have the kind of concerns that people that age have: rent, work, and love,” Prady says. Randall Einhorn, a director on Parks & Recreation and The Office, was hired to give the show the right reality-show feel.The new Muppets have edgier versions of their old personas: Gonzo is still an outcast, the Swedish Chef still loves meatballs, and Kermit is still the lovable straight man, even as he’s shacking up with a bedroom-eyed look-alike of his ex. (“What can I say? I’m attracted to pigs,” he jokes in the pilot.) But the show airs at 8 p.m., so most jokes come with the kid gloves. “I don’t know if an 8-year-old will relate to a story of a stand-up comedian who gets in trouble because he’s using details from his personal life and his girlfriend in his act,” Prady says. “But if the stand-up comedian is a bear, maybe.” Every prop, down to Kermit’s coffee mug, must be specially designed, which makes the show costly to produce. “That’s one of the problems we always had—you’re essentially making a visual effects show in every shot,” says Alex Rockwell, former head of creative affairs for the Jim Henson Co. who now works there as a freelance producer. The budget for each episode runs several million dollars. Prady and Kushell won’t provide a number, but they say it’s about twice that of a regular sitcom. The Muppets takes six days to film an episode instead of the usual five. Miss Piggy has a tendency to karate-chop herself to death; her head, made of hard plastic, has to be replaced every 10 hours. For one episode, when Fozzie drives on a Los Angeles freeway, the set designers had to rig a small car and actually drive him in it. Everything on the show is done by hand just as it was under Henson. “This is much more complicated than anything on The Office,” Einhorn says.The show is funny in that benign sitcom way, and there’s something endearing about seeing the Muppets reunite again. But Prady and his crew don’t seem too concerned about it being a hit. Instead, they talk a lot about what Henson would have made of it. “Those of us who worked with Jim are forever loyal to him,” says Goelz, the voice of Gonzo. He’s 69 and signed a seven-year contract. “We’re very protective of these characters.”'),\n",

       "  'With each passing year, Hollywood looks further back for properties to revitalize. And this summer proved the industry has yet to meet a title that’s too washed-up to dust off. “The people who decide what’s going to get made have come of age,” says David Poland, editor-in-chief of Movie City News. “They’re making the kinds of movies they were obsessed with as kids.”That explains breakout titles like Mad Max: Fury Road, featuring a character last seen in Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome, which opened 30 years ago. Or Jurassic World, Universal’s critically dismissed dino revamp, which grossed more than $1.6 billion worldwide, making it the year’s biggest hit so far. There’s since been a so-so new Vacation and a solid Mission Impossible, but the real nostalgia trip is yet to come. Star Wars: The Force Awakens opens in December. Disney and Lucasfilm are already filming two more with Oscar Isaac and the other new stars.It used to be that faithful sequels released in rapid-fire succession were surefire hits. Strangely, the further these franchises have strayed from the source material, the better they’ve done. Simply updating an old storyline no longer draws an audience. Late June’s Terminator: Genisys, for instance, featured Arnold Schwarzenegger returning to the role that made him a superstar back in 1984. Marking Schwarzenegger’s first appearance as the Terminator since 2003, the Paramount release felt like a retread of the earlier films. And it opened to a pathetic $27 million.Fans of the Transporter series will probably scoff at The Transporter: Refueled, Lionsgate’s sad attempt to revive a franchise that starred Jason Statham as a hotshot driver who carries secret cargo for shady figures. The last one, Transporter 3, opened in 2008 to decent, if unspectacular, numbers—$31.7 million in the U.S., $109 million worldwide—capitalizing on the rise of its tough-guy star. But that was seven years ago. After Statham refused to sign on for three more movies, the studio swiftly replaced him with Ed Skrein, a relatively unknown English actor.“Audiences were ready to see dinosaurs eat people ... again”Jurassic World, for its part, looked little like its predecessors. At first, director Colin Trevorrow’s film came under fire for what some considered sexism, but that didn’t stop people from buying tickets. “Many young adults who were part of the Jurassic Park summer of 1993 came out with their kids in tow,” says Gitesh Pandya, founder of Box Office Guru. “Audiences were ready to see dinosaurs eat people on the big screen again,” Poland says. The script, although technically a sequel, relied on fresher faces playing new characters. It helped that one was Chris Pratt, a huge star after last year’s Guardians of the Galaxy.Terminator: Genisys also tried to surround its weathered star with young blood, but it didn’t help. “Schwarzenegger has had one failure after another since he returned to movies,” says Phil Contrino, chief analyst at boxoffice.com. And the film, which lacked the guiding hand of creator James Cameron, wound up feeling like a lackluster rehash, not a reinvention for a new generation.There is hope yet for international success. Genisys had a massive opening in China on Aug. 23, making $27 million in one day. That’s why “resuscitating even a decades-old franchise is often more appealing than making an original film,” Pandya says. So prepare yourself for the all-female Ghostbusters, coming in January. And the update to 1982’s Blade Runner. And the follow-up to 1996’s alien-invasion hit Independence Day. And even Top Gun 2, which will reportedly bring back Tom Cruise some 30 years after he first took flight. After that comes The Legend of Conan, featuring Schwarzenegger as the aging barbarian he made famous in the mid-’80s. Then, probably, another Terminator. The “I’ll be back” jokes are just writing themselves.'),\n",

       "  'The successful expansion by Netflix into Australia, Canada, Europe, and Latin America over the last five years has increased investor confidence in the streaming service’s plan to build the first worldwide, online television network. Its steady growth—users topped 65 million globally in June—has fueled a $22.4 billion increase in Netflix’s market value since the end of 2014.For all its success, Netflix has been a Western phenomenon. About 65 percent of its subscribers are in the U.S., while an additional 19 percent will hail from Brazil, Canada, and the U.K. by yearend, estimates Nomura Securities. By the end of 2016, Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings wants to reach the rest of the globe, a sprint through more than 150 countries across Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East. That push begins with Netflix’s Sept. 2 entry into Japan, home to more broadband households than any of its current markets outside the U.S.Yet Japan has vexed other Western media companies, including U.S. rival Hulu, who want the country’s aging consumers to pay for TV content. And the subscription video-on-demand market there is about a tenth the size of the streaming market in the U.S. That’s likely one reason Netflix executives, including Hastings, have lowered expectations. “We expect a slow and steady growth in the Japanese market relative to other markets,” Hastings says. “The Japanese are slow to warm and trust the brand.”A smooth rollout in Japan would help calm investors’ lingering concerns about Netflix’s expansion plans. The degree of difficulty there is higher than in the West; and while every country has its quirks, Japan will be instructive for the company’s entry into bigger markets such as China and India, says Vivek Couto, executive director of Media Partners Asia, a media and telecommunications consulting firm. “Japan is a market more challenging than anywhere they’ve been,” Couto says.Despite Japan’s reputation for advanced technology, its TV market is retrograde. Most people watch one of seven free broadcast networks and use digital video recorders to tape their favorite dramas, according to Couto. Fewer than 30 percent of Japanese households even subscribe to pay TV, and subscription video on demand generated sales of just $450 million last year, Media Partners Asia estimates. That compares with about 85 percent and $4 billion, respectively, in the U.S.“It’s not going to be like Australia, where Netflix has streamrolled its way in and became the dominant provider,” says Seung Bak, CEO of U.S.-based video provider DramaFever, which buys content from Japan and other international markets. “In Japan there’s a culture of not paying for content. That’s only just starting to change.”Japan has also turned inward at a time when Hollywood studios have increased their reliance on foreign markets such as China for growth. Foreign films’ share of the Japanese box office dropped to 42 percent in 2014 from 73 percent in 2002, according to the Motion Picture Producers Association of Japan. By contrast, China has become the most important foreign market for U.S. films and has overtaken Japan as the world’s second-largest film market.“It’s not going to be like Australia, where Netflix has streamrolled its way in and became the dominant provider.” —Seung Bak, DramaFever CEOThat ups the risks for Netflix, as its global strategy has relied on viewers in most countries having similar tastes. Its most popular shows in the U.S., such as Orange Is the New Black, are also its top shows overseas.To entice viewers, Netflix will offer local originals at its Japan launch, a first for it in any global market. While local shows eventually make up 10 percent to 20 percent of offerings in most Netflix territories, that will rise to 40 percent in Japan, says Greg Peters, head of Netflix’s operations in Japan.One of the first local originals is Terrace House, a reality show produced by Fuji Television Network that bears some similarity to MTV’s The Real World. It will be central to Netflix’s pitch to Japanese viewers, as will Daredevil, from Walt Disney’s Marvel Studios. While U.S. shows are often relegated to second-tier cable networks in Japan, Netflix sees an opportunity to bring them into the mainstream by promoting them more aggressively than is usually done. “American TV shows are not as popular in Japan,” says Ted Sarandos, Netflix’s chief content officer. “I’m not convinced that’s because Japanese have radically different tastes than the rest of the world.”Netflix figures the potential for an on-demand revolution exists, since much of Japan has access to broadband Internet at home, and people routinely watch videos over their mobile phones. The two largest subscription video providers in Japan have ties to mobile phone carriers SoftBank Group and NTT Docomo, which offer them as part of larger phone packages. Netflix on Aug. 24 announced its own partnership with SoftBank, which will promote the service in its stores and kiosks, on its website, and in other retail outlets. SoftBank customers will be able to pay for Netflix on their phone bill, and the Netflix app will arrive preinstalled on new smartphones in October. Consumer electronics giants Panasonic and Sony have agreed to include a Netflix button on TV remotes.The deals reflect a conscious effort by Netflix to strike a conciliatory tone with local players that can influence consumers. Hulu struggled to earn that trust when it entered Japan in 2011. The Japanese viewed Hulu as gaijin, or foreigner, according to Media Partners’ Couto. Plus, it charged about $15 a month; Netflix will cost less than the $8.99 most of its U.S. subscribers pay. Hulu didn’t gain traction until its prices were lowered and its local unit was sold to Nippon Television Holdings in 2014.The real challenge is to generate excitement in a place that isn’t clamoring for Netflix, says Cameron Johnson, a company executive working on the Japanese site. While most Japanese websites are dense with small photos and many entry points, Netflix opted to stick with the spare look it uses in other countries. Johnson says he’ll start tweaking the service within minutes of its debut, responding to complaints and praise. Netflix’s entry into Latin America in 2011 was slow to take off, but the company credits its eventual turnaround to more than 100 different changes it made to the service based on viewer behavior and feedback.That nimbleness is one reason investors support the expansion into unfamiliar territory. Anthony DiClemente, an analyst with Nomura Securities in New York, estimates Netflix may approach 5 million subscribers in Japan by 2020, just behind its bigger markets in Germany, Brazil, and the U.K.Hastings won’t give hard numbers, but he’s optimistic about Netflix’s prospects. “It may be one of our best markets in the long term because when the Japanese society embraces a brand, it is a very deep connection, very long-term,” he said on a recent earnings call. “So we’re willing to make that investment knowing that it’s not the quick route to success that might be in other countries.”—With Pavel AlpeyevThe bottom line: Betting that streaming is a global phenomenon, Netflix will expand to more than 150 countries by the end of 2016.'),\n",

       "  'As a working mom, Abbie Schiller relied on 30 minutes of television in the morning and the evening to keep her toddler occupied. There was plenty of programming that taught kids to count and spell, but the Los Angeles resident saw a void when it came to social and emotional learning. So Schiller, who was head of public relations for ABC Daytime, improvised. “My daughter was really into the Disney princess franchise,” she says. “I would put my own spin on these stories—the stepmother would be misguided instead of wicked. I would use those stories as an opportunity to develop empathy and kindness instead of making judgments.”Schiller left ABC in 2007 to focus full time on creating videos and books that help kids cope with strong emotions, like jealousy and anger, and sticky situations, like getting lost. She and her husband, Marc Gordonson, a digital advertising executive, sold their house and moved in with her parents. She reached out to a former classmate, filmmaker Samantha Kurtzman-Counter, also a mom, for advice on how to produce her own videos. Kurtzman-Counter agreed to do the pilot.The women began pitching parents at parks and friends’ houses and raised $500,000 in six weeks, enough to make their first video, The Feelings Show. Gap signed on as a sponsor and held a special in-store promotion for the launch. Schiller and Kurtzman-Counter formed the Mother Company in 2010 and have since released four videos (download $12.99, DVD $14.99), 10 picture books that reinforce lessons from the shows ($12.95 each), and an iPhone app (99¢). The titles are sold through the company’s website, as well as on Amazon.com, on iTunes, and at more than 1,000 stores.The Mother Company’s 45-minute videos tackle issues such as sibling rivalry and safety through a combination of animated sketches , segments with live actors, and music videos. An animated sketch on overcoming frustration is narrated by Mel Brooks, whose son went to high school with Schiller and Kurtzman-Counter. Some TV shows, such as Sesame Street, cover similar territory. But Mother Company videos are already among the strongest in the social and emotional learning category, says Seeta Pai, vice president for research at Common Sense Media, a nonprofit that rates kids’ media. Common Sense gave all four videos its highest rating.Schiller says after she drafted her initial business plan, she met with three investors; each offered her $2 million in exchange for control of her concept. She turned them down: “My intuition was telling me, ‘Get away from these people. They don’t have the company’s best interest at heart.’ ” Instead, the co-founders recruited 23 angel investors, almost all mothers, willing to chip in from $6,000 to more than $2 million, for a total of about $5 million.The company has had double- and triple-digit revenue growth every quarter, its books are sold in nine countries, and the partners say they’re in talks with the Public Broadcasting Service about national syndication of video content, according to Schiller. She’s exploring partnerships with larger companies to expand the company’s distribution network and digital presence, but she has no intention of handing over the reins. “When we started, people in children’s television told us that we’d never find an audience for our show—that it was too educational,” Schiller recalls. “That everything had to be animated, that we shouldn’t use big words like ‘frustrated’ for preschoolers. Thankfully, we didn’t listen to any of that.”The bottom line: The Mother Company has seen double- and triple-digit revenue growth from its kids’ videos, books, and iPhone app.'),\n",

       "  'Chinese filmgoers wearing 3D glasses watch Monster Hunt in Shanghai on July 26.Since mid-July, the biggest movie outside the U.S. hasn’t featured a Marvel superhero or dinosaurs from a revamped franchise or even an American action star. It hasn’t been an American film at all, but a Chinese animation/live-action fantasy, Monster Hunt, about a baby monster smuggled through ancient China. Directed by Raman Hui, a director of DreamWorks Animation’s Shrek the Third, Monster Hunt opened in China on July 16 and immediately broke records: Its Saturday, July 18, tally of $29.8 million stands as the biggest single-day gross for a Chinese film and tops the opening day take of many Western hits, including 2014’s Transformers: Age of Extinction, which grossed $27 million on its first day. Ticket sales have reached $211 million, making Monster Hunt the highest-grossing Chinese movie ever and, with a $40 million budget, profitable, too.Monster Hunt, produced by Hong Kong studio Edko Films, isn’t the only domestic hit lighting up Chinese box offices. Superhero parody Pancake Man, directed by and starring popular online comedian Da Peng, has brought in $132 million since opening on July 17—its budget was $13 million. The movie was released by privately owned Wanda Media, the film and TV production arm of Wanda Group, one of the country’s biggest conglomerates. The two movies’ success reflects both the growth of Chinese audiences and the maturing of the nation’s film industry. On July 18 the Chinese box office hit $70.2 million in one day, almost all from local films. “You’re seeing Chinese filmmakers getting better at their craft,” says Rance Pow, head of the film industry consulting firm Artisan Gateway.With its mix of government-controlled enterprises and independent companies, the Chinese system looks very little like Hollywood. Longtime Hong Kong producers such as Edko regularly collaborate and compete with mainland giants Wanda, Huayi Brothers Media, and Bona Film Group, as well as the powerful state-owned entities such as China Film Group, which controls the importing and distribution of foreign films and produces its own. Internet companies Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent, and others are getting in on the action as producers and distributors.All this investment and integration has led to improved scripts and greater diversity in an industry known for martial arts films and period spectacles. Today, feel-good fantasies such as Monster Hunt, which one Hollywood Reporter critic dubbed “a sentimental dollop of easily digestible moral storytelling,” succeed alongside comedies like Pancake Man, with Jean-Claude Van Damme as a villain. “There’s a growing commercial value and slickness to the Chinese films,” Pow says.Chinese films benefit from state support. The industry is managed by several government-controlled entities, including the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television, the Censorship Bureau, and China Film Group. Moratoriums on foreign productions regularly clear the release calendar of Western blockbusters so domestic films have unfettered access to audiences. And they ensure Chinese movies make up about 55 percent of the annual box office. There are three blackouts annually—during the Lunar New Year/spring festival period in February; in mid-to-late summer, after the first wave of Hollywood summer releases opens in China; and in December. The current blackout is expected to go until late August, when Terminator: Genisys will open, followed by Mission: Impossible—Rogue Nation, Minions, and Inside Out.China’s stock market crash isn’t discouraging film fans. “Moviegoing tends to be recession-proof,” says Phil Contrino, vice president and chief analyst for BoxOffice.com. “Despite the turmoil in the Chinese economy, people are still going to the movies.”About 15 new screens open daily in China. There are 5,660 cinemas with 28,000 screens serving 1.3 billion people. The U.S. has about 40,000 screens for a population one-fourth the size. Wanda Group is the biggest theater owner in China and the world, with more than 150 venues and 1,300 screens on the mainland. (It’s been a big player in the U.S. since 2012, when it bought AMC Entertainment.) From January to March, China built 554 movie houses, with 2,806 screens.Construction until recently was centered in first- and second-tier cities, with populations of 3 million and higher, Pow says. “So the cinema development is expanding into tertiary markets now, into suburban and rural areas,” he says. “When a town gets a new shopping center, they get a new McDonald’s, KFC, Starbucks, and a new movie theater.” By 2017, China is expected to have about 9,500 theaters and 53,000 screens.The building frenzy started about a decade ago, says Jonathan Landreth, a former Asia editor of the Hollywood Reporter and now managing editor of Chinafile.com, an online general interest magazine. Until that time, people bought pirated DVDs and stayed at home. “You went to the movies maybe once a year. It was an end-of-year tradition,” he says.In what may be a sign of things to come, China’s monthly box office receipts for February passed those of the U.S. for the first time. Powered by the Lunar New Year holiday, the biggest time for moviegoing in China, February’s total box office hit $650 million, compared with $640 million in the U.S., according to Chinese research firm ENT Group.That will start to happen more, say industry analysts, presenting both an opportunity and a challenge for Hollywood studios, all of which are trying to expand in China. Cooperating with state players is essential for foreign studios to succeed. China Film Group, which controls release dates and determines the number of screens a film will play on, took a 10 percent stake in Universal’s Furious 7, which opened on a record 5,454 screens on April 12. Thanks to the company’s support, the film had no major competition for a month, save for the Johnny Depp flop Mortdecai, which didn’t make a dent. Even Avengers: Age of Ultron had to move out of the way, premiering in China almost two weeks after it had opened in most of the rest of the world. Furious 7 is now the highest-grossing film in Chinese history.Hollywood has been navigating the Chinese market in increasingly creative ways, including by producing more films with Chinese partners and by casting more Chinese actors, such as star Li Bingbing in Transformers: Age of Extinction. Major scenes of that movie were shot in China, and there’s even dialogue praising the Chinese state. The private equity firm China Media Capital has struck deals with Warner Bros., DreamWorks Animation, and IMAX, and Shanghai Media Group has signed contracts with Walt Disney, among others. Next year’s animated Kung Fu Panda 3 will be produced partly in China, using Chinese animators and designers, via Oriental DreamWorks, a new Shanghai-based animation studio.“Hollywood makes global products, and for the Chinese market to reach its full potential, Hollywood films and homegrown films will have to thrive side by side,” says Contrino. “The growth of the Chinese market means that both industries will be able to reach new levels of success.”The bottom line: Bigger and better local films and growing audiences in China have created a huge movie market to rival Hollywood.'),\n",

       "  'As any parent who’s hauled awe-struck kids through a Disney park in the U.S. knows, the stars of the show are the ever-present Mickey, Minnie, and the fairy tale princesses (think Cinderella, Ariel, and Elsa) that Walt Disney transformed into a perpetual profit machine. But visitors to Shanghai Disneyland, set to open next spring, will be wowed by a new cast member in a starring role: Chinese culture. Whether it’s the giant glass peony blossom representing nobility and good fortune at the center of a fairy-bedecked fountain, the “lucky” cloud patterns painted on some spires of the massive castle dwarfing the park, or the traditional dim sum restaurant in the Disneytown night life area, every detail will exhibit a heavy dose of mainland history and customs.“We’re building something that’s authentically Disney and distinctly Chinese,” Disney Chairman Robert Iger says. “It definitely will be Disneyland in China, but we’ll obviously be respectful of the Chinese culture and relatable to the people of China.”In May the company opened the world’s largest Disney Store in Shanghai, the mainland’s most affluent metropolis. But the $5.5 billion resort Disney is building in partnership with Shanghai’s local government—within a three-hour drive of more than 330 million potential visitors—is a far bigger bet on China’s rising middle class. It’s also the entertainment giant’s largest foreign investment ever.Despite Disney’s longtime success in theme parks, risks remain. Since the 1980s, many Chinese real estate developers have added entertainment components to their projects, so there are plenty of rivals for mainlanders’ leisure-time dollars. The number of Chinese amusement parks, including water parks and other destinations with rides, is expected to reach 850 this year, up 40 percent since 2006, according to consultant IBISWorld. Comcast’s Universal Studios is building a theme park in Beijing, and DreamWorks Animation is opening a film studio and entertainment complex in Shanghai. Attractions operated by local competitors, such as Songcheng Park in Hangzhou and Chimelong Ocean Kingdom in Hengqin, rank among the most attended in the world, according to consulting firm Aecom.“They [Disney] have to be on top of their game,” says Dennis Speigel, a theme park consultant from Cincinnati who’s worked in China. “It better be sized correctly, it better be finished properly, because the Chinese are so into technology and social media, now they know what’s going on.”China’s one-child policy and a desire by extended families to travel together often mean there are as many as four adults for every kid in the parks, says Craig Hanna, chief creative officer for Thinkwell Group, a theme park designer based in Los Angeles, which has done work in China. So operators need to design plenty of seating, restaurants, viewing areas, and open space where older family members can camp out while others go on rides, Hanna says.Chinese companies don’t typically offer paid vacation time, so park attendance tends to surge around a handful of national holidays, according to Tony Sze, senior counselor of the Chimelong Group, one of China’s largest park operators. To reduce the waits at rides during peak times, the company schedules parades and street performances to draw customers elsewhere in its parks, he says. Disney has been adding games, videos, and robots to distract Shanghai customers while they wait.Another challenge is the Chinese propensity for line-cutting, detailed in a 2010 article in InPark Magazine, an independent trade publication. The article described tactics such as “constant walking,” moving forward while pretending there’s no line, or using a kid as an “advance man” to snake through the queue, bypassing the waiting throngs. The article recommended enclosed lines that narrow to single file so people can’t jump ahead.Disney’s largest castle.“Rather than pull people away and say ‘I’m sorry, you can’t do that,’ you make it impossible,” says John Rust, senior creative director at Rethink Leisure & Entertainment, another California-based theme park designer.The Shanghai Disney Resort will feature 11 acres of gardens at its center, with benches and areas for strolling. Playing to Iger’s mandate to focus on Chinese culture, the Garden of the Twelve Friends will blend Chinese zodiac symbols with Disney characters. Remy, from the Pixar film Ratatouille, represents the Year of the Rat. The lambs from Mary Poppins do the same for the Year of the Sheep.The Chinese like large-scale visuals, Hanna says. And Disney will satisfy that with Shanghai’s Enchanted Storybook Castle, the tallest and largest such structure at any Disney park. Chinese parkgoers also expect live entertainment. Outside the Shanghai park will be Disneytown, a shopping plaza with no entry fee that will serve as a kind of overflow area and include a theater with the first Mandarin-language live production of The Lion King.Disney has learned from past mistakes. Disneyland Paris opened in 1992 to French criticism of the lack of wine on its menus; Shanghai will have plenty of local food at various prices. The 310-acre Hong Kong Disneyland was dinged at its debut as too small; Shanghai will be three times the size. And the Paris park, with seven on-site hotels with a total 5,765 rooms, suffered from a lodging glut; Shanghai will open with two Disney-run hotels totaling 1,220 rooms. “They’ve definitely learned some lessons,” says Lee Cockerell, who supervised food offerings at the hotels at Disneyland Paris when it opened. “Understand the culture, respect the culture, and make sure the guests are going to get what they expect.”—With Gregory TurkThe bottom line: The $5.5 billion Shanghai Disneyland is customized for China, where adult visitors may outnumber kids 4 to 1.(Corrects ownership of trade publication in eighth paragraph of story that was published on July 9.)'),\n",

       "  'A few years ago, Asi Sharabi was thumbing through a children’s book his 3-year-old daughter received as a gift, trying to assess whether it was worthy of her bedtime rotation. This particular story had a trick to it, something Sharabi had never seen before. Prior to printing, it was personalized to include his daughter’s name on some pages. “I got the warm and fuzzy feeling of seeing my daughter’s name,” Sharabi says. “But it lasted exactly two seconds. The book was total garbage.”It was 2012, and Sharabi was running a small ad-consulting firm in London. Around the same time, he’d read The Lean Startup by the American entrepreneur Eric Ries, who advocates that new companies adhere to a strict methodology, emphasizing things such as data-driven experimentation and iterative product releases. As Sharabi pondered his daughter’s book—powerful concept, shoddy execution—he thought Ries’s ideas might apply. Sharabi did some online research and learned that personalized children’s books had been around for decades, at least since the 1970s. But much of the technology, if you could even call it that, had remained static. The genre lacked any seminal texts. So he convened a small team of partners, consisting of writer David Cadji-Newby, illustrator Pedro Serapicos, and technologist Tal Oron. They set out to create a uniquely customizable—and, ideally, awe-inspiring—children’s book.Asi SharabiThe result, alternatively called The Little Boy/Girl Who Lost His/Her Name, is now selling like gangbusters internationally. The four partners have quit their jobs to work full time on Lost My Name, their company. In two years, the book, which costs about $30, has sold more than 600,000 copies. Last year, according to the company’s sales figures, it was the top-selling picture book in the U.K. It’s also popular in Australia and Canada and has sold almost 125,000 copies in the U.S. The marketing has largely been through word-of-mouth; sales got a boost in 2014, when the founders appeared on Dragon’s Den, a top BBC tech program. Sharabi believes his title is on track to join the canon of children’s classics, including The Very Hungry Caterpillar and Where the Wild Things Are, which remain popular year after year, particularly as gifts to new parents. “We’re building it as an evergreen proposition,” he says. “Every book-loving family will have this.”Last year the children’s and young-adult book and e-book market grew in the U.S. by 20.9 percent, topping $4.3 billion, according to the Association of American Publishers. The expanding market has attracted many entrants. Giants such as Walt Disney and independent publishers like Sourcebooks and KD Novelties are selling personalized children’s books while also experimenting with personalized digital formats. Lost My Name is “facing a tremendous amount of competition,” says Thad McIlroy, a book industry analyst who runs the Future of Publishing website.What makes Lost My Name different is its “full stack” business model, like that of eyewear company Warby Parker, which aims to control every aspect of a buyer’s experience. The product isn’t available in bookstores or on Amazon.com. To buy a copy, you have to visit Lost My Name’s website, which ships for free anywhere in the world.“This was about picking up the best partners who can help us make this company as big as Pixar”Parents start by typing in the name and gender of their child. The site’s code uses the letters of the child’s name to determine which of about 300 set story elements—a pirate searching for lost treasure, say—to compile, along with connective transitions, into a narrative. The plot follows a small child, suffering from an identity crisis of sorts, who proceeds on a journey of self-discovery. Along the way, she encounters a series of struggling creatures (aardvarks, mermaids, tarantulas, and so on), each of whom she helps. In return for her kindness, she receives a particular letter of the alphabet. By the end of the adventure, the child winds up in possession of her own name. “People send us videos of their kids getting to the last page and going completely bananas,” Sharabi says. “\\u2009‘How did they do it, Mommy? How did they know my name?’\\u2009” (It’s geared toward kids age 2 to 6.)This being 2015, the four partners see traditional children’s books not only as entertainment but also as a narrative-delivery platform in need of disrupting. In June, Lost My Name closed on a $9 million round of Series A funding from a handful of well-known venture capital firms in the U.S.—where Lost My Name would like to increase sales—including Google Ventures, Greycroft Partners, the Chernin Group, and Allen & Co.The backers believe Lost My Name can turn personalized mass media into the next thing in children’s entertainment. Dana Settle, co-founder of Greycroft Partners, says she frequently hears uninspiring funding pitches from media startups run by talented technologists who treat content like a common, easily sourced commodity or from gifted creative types with little appreciation for the technical and marketing challenges of the modern entertainment business. What made Lost My Name appealing, she says, is that its founders are simultaneously coming at it from the technical, creative, and business sides. “This is exactly the way to build a modern-day publishing platform,” Settle says.Before skeptics can cough-cough-shout “tech bubble,” Sharabi, 41, points out that, unlike many of the world’s hot startups, Lost My Name is profitable. “We have zero inventory,” he says. “We get paid for every book before we make it.” The company has millions in the bank. “We didn’t need to raise money,” Sharabi adds. “This was about picking up the best partners who can help us make this company as big as Pixar.”The founders describe the company, somewhat predictably, as “platform agnostic.” Moving forward, they plan to expand from books into personalized animated movies. The technology to create and deliver a customized video, Sharabi concedes, is more challenging than that for print. How it will work remains unclear, though the company has created several prototypes.Sharabi, who grew up in Rehovot, Israel, is adjusting to his nascent role as a startup visionary. He first moved to England 15 years ago to study at the London School of Economics and Political Science, where he earned a Ph.D. Eventually, he soured on academia and turned to advertising. Now he spends much of his time thinking about how to shape Lost My Name’s corporate culture. The company prides itself on being nonhierarchical, parent-friendly, and driven by engineering. “We are a technology company that happens to sell physical books,” Sharabi says. “I credit some of our success to the fact that none of us came from publishing backgrounds.”Even so, says McIlroy, the industry analyst, the direct-to-consumer business model is likely to hamper the company’s quest for growth. A recent study by Nielsen found that 71 percent of all purchases of children’s books are driven by in-store displays. “You look at surveys of why kids’ books are purchased, and you see that a lot of it depends on retail exposure,” he says.Avoiding traditional retailers, Lost My Name is already building strong ties to its customers. There are 400,000 or so; many are repeat buyers, and lots of them have been pestering Lost My Name to sell them new products.In an age of rampant social media and worries about children’s screen time, it’s easy to balk at the prospect of even more self-referential kids’ media. The company is aware of this problem. It’s vigilant against turning personalization into another form of self-infatuation, Sharabi says. “We don’t want to create narcissistic entertainment for the selfie generation.”This fall, Lost My Name plans to publish its second personalized book. To create it, customers will enter into the website a child’s address—there are no plans to sell this information—and the company will build a book that begins in outer space and ends at the kid’s doorstep. Along the way, the story will incorporate unique spatial elements from various data sources, including real NASA images. It will be more technically complex than the first book, which was done on a shoestring budget by a bunch of sleep-deprived fathers with full-time jobs.Many of the 40 employees at the company’s new headquarters in London are working on the release. Seventeen are programmers. “We like the idea of quiet technology,” Sharabi says. “There’s tons of complexity behind a product that ultimately facilitates a very quiet, old-fashioned bonding moment.” Most parents don’t understand how many thousands of lines of code are behind every personalized book the company produces, he says. Nor do they care.'),\n",

       "  '2015-05-01',\n",
       "  'Ka-Pow!For years, there’s been hand-wringing over the changes Netflix, YouTube, and Amazon.com might force on the pay-TV industry, as the upstarts eschew bloated 500-channel offerings in favor of cheaper, slimmer packages of programs that consumers actually want to watch. But now the cable and satellite industry is facing a more immediate—and potentially more damaging—challenge from one of its own, aimed squarely at a financial linchpin of the business: the programming bundle.Verizon Communications’ FiOS service, the No.\\u20096 U.S. pay-TV operator, in late April began selling Custom TV, a $55-a-month package of 45 base channels, plus a customer’s choice of two small collections of entertainment, news, sports, or kids’ offerings. Other tiers can be added for $10 each. But the big difference is that no sports networks are mandatory in the core bundle. Instead, much to the dismay of cable sports programmers Walt Disney, 21st Century Fox, and NBCUniversal, Custom TV puts sports into one of the tiers that people can choose not to buy.That subtle shift upsets the balance of a system that’s worked very lucratively for a very long time for media companies with sports channels. Disney’s ESPN charges providers $6.61 a month per subscriber, according to estimates by the financial analysis firm SNL Kagan, while Fox Sports 1 commands 99¢. That’s loose change that adds up fast when most Americans are buying traditional pay-TV from Comcast or other cable or satellite distributors. The way the big bundle works, sports are a forced part of the deal, with people who couldn’t care less about them helping pay the freight for the zealots who’d never cut the cord for fear of missing a live soccer match. It also is the reason that SNL Kagan forecasts ESPN will rake in $7.5 billion from pay-TV operators this year.The unbundling shift is “a crack in the dike,” says Ed Desser, a media consultant who spent more than 20 years working for the NBA. “It’s vitally important to ESPN and ESPN’s economics that they be in 85 percent of the households, or some significantly high number.”That’s why the move by Verizon, whose FiOS service serves only about 5.7 million U.S. pay-TV subscribers, is being taken so seriously. Disney, which has the most to lose from such a shift because ESPN charges cable operators the largest monthly per-subscriber fee of any programming service, is striking back. On April 27, ESPN sued Verizon in New York state court, accusing it of violating existing contracts that require the sports service to be included as a basic offering in subscriber packages on FiOS.Disney-owned TV and radio stations in New York have stopped all advertising for Verizon’s Custom TV options. NBCUniversal, owner of NBC Sports Network, and Fox Sports also denounced Custom TV in statements, claiming their existing deals with Verizon were never intended to allow their content to be included in its build-your-own offering. Verizon said in a statement that it’s within its rights to offer the Custom TV package. ESPN had no comment beyond its lawsuit.“They are creating the appearance of more choice when the vast majority of their existing subscribers are going to have exactly the same packages they have today.” —Ed DesserThe popularity of major live sports not only lets Disney and others charge higher fees for their programming, it also gives sports network owners leverage in negotiating the distribution of their less-popular pay-TV channels. By boosting subscriber numbers on such networks, content creators can sell more ads on them. But take sports out of the basic package, and this pyramid of profits could begin to crumble. “Verizon has broken the traditional paradigm,” says Erik Bannon, a TV analyst with IHS. “If Verizon wins, this could mean billions of dollars in lost revenue for Disney.”Skinny packages such as Custom TV aren’t going to end cable as we know it just yet, because some distributors’ current contracts with content providers limit how many subscribers their slender products can have. Also, consultant Desser says, some skinny bundles are structured in a such a minimalist way that they essentially steer many TV watchers to add extras to their discount packages. “They are creating the appearance of more choice when the vast majority of their existing subscribers are going to have exactly the same packages they have today,” he says.The skinny trend doesn’t upset everyone in the entertainment industry. CBS doesn’t see reduced bundles as a risk to the most-watched TV network in the U.S. It streams its content online for customers for $5.99 a month. It’s just added its cable sports network to Custom TV. “We are confident that our expanding lineup of premier live programming will be a favorite among Verizon’s sports fans and that this new option will help continue grow our distribution,” CBS said in a statement. Cablevision Systems has even rolled out a “cord-cutter” offer that gives noncable customers a TV antenna for local programming and Internet starting at $34.90 a month, which can be used to stream shows.Still, Custom TV and other new options such as Dish Network’s Sling TV—a $20-a-month service that started in February with plenty of sports, though none of the broadcast networks—could imperil second-tier pay channels that have relatively small audiences. In addition to ESPN and ESPN2, Disney owns the SEC Network, ESPNU, and ESPNews. And Fox has two versions of Fox Sports, in addition to several regional sports networks. “Until today Disney has been saying, ‘You must take these channels,’\\u2009” Brannon says. “In a future world Disney may be saying, ‘Please take our channels.’\\u2009”The bottom line: Verizon’s new skinny pay-TV package costs just $55 a month. One reason: no costly sports programming.'),\n",

       "  'Franklin Leonard, host of The Black List Table Reads.Malcolm Spellman and Tim Talbott, a screenwriting duo known as the Robotard 8000, sit on canary-yellow chairs in a Hollywood studio discussing their darker days. “Both of us were dead,” Spellman says. Back in 2008, after a few decent years in the industry, work had dried up. “Our reaction was to flex our s--- to the max,” recalls Spellman, now a writer on Empire, the hit Fox TV show. The two friends are being interviewed by Franklin Leonard, host of a new weekly podcast, The Black List Table Reads, which features dramatic readings of Hollywood’s best unproduced screenplays. Leonard, who’s become a patron saint for movie writers over the past decade, is partly responsible for reviving the Robotard 8000.Film development executives are always searching for new material, but it’s tough to trust unvetted talent with multimillion-dollar projects or gauge the potential of more offbeat stories. So in 2005, Leonard started his Annual Black List, which highlights the year’s best-liked unproduced scripts, as nominated by more than 300 industry insiders. “We’re just as interested in identifying scripts that are tiny but well-written as we are in box office material,” he says. Sometimes his discoveries are both: Ben Affleck found the script for Argo on the list; it went on to win the Oscar for Best Picture.At first, Leonard’s hobby occupied him for three weeks each December. Now he’s made it a business that employs five people. In addition to the survey, which earns nothing, he’s introduced blcklst.com to connect screenwriters with and without agents to producers looking to make films. Writers pay $25 a month to have a script hosted and $50 for a professional evaluation. (Leonard’s company keeps half; the rest goes to the evaluators.) So far, more than 20,000 scripts have been uploaded.The audience at a live reading.“It used to be a closed-loop system where, if you didn’t have an agent, you were pretty much screwed, because nobody would read your material,” says Scott Myers, author of the screenwriting blog Go Into the Story. “Franklin’s created an alternate to the old, very narrow, confined way of getting in.” Studios such as Warner Bros. and Walt Disney have hired writers directly from blcklst.com, and a few scripts written by nobodies have made it from the all-access site onto the exclusive Annual Black List.The podcast, which will come out on April 16, is an attempt to get nonindustry fans involved long before a script gets bought, filmed, and distributed to megaplexes. It should appeal to the same people who, while they may not work in Tinseltown, love movies enough to follow trade websites such as Deadline and the Hollywood Reporter, both of which revere the Annual Black List as if it’s a sacred document. The podcast is being co-produced by Midroll Media, a podcast company that works with hosts including Marc Maron, Neil deGrasse Tyson, and Paul Scheer, who runs Wolfpop, an entertainment-focused network.Each month, Leonard will choose a script and Scheer will help supply actors from his Wolfpop entourage, including maybe-familiar voices like Lauren Lapkus, Jason Mantzoukas, and other actors who’ve appeared on Orange Is the New Black, Parks and Recreation, and other shows. Featured writers will keep full rights to their scripts while making 50 percent of any ad revenue earned from the podcast. “If their episodes are popular, they may get a massive windfall,” Leonard says. He also sells $25 tickets for live readings of some Black List scripts.The Robotard 8000 screenplay Balls Out will be the first one featured. The profanity-laced comedy centers on insurance salesman Jim Simmers, who, after a near-death experience, finds out there’s no afterlife. He goes on a screw-the-world rampage to get a promotion, a new car, and the hot girl at work. It was an obvious choice, Leonard says: “It’s very much a male-driven comedy and simultaneously a brilliant satire of one.”When Talbott and Spellman finished Balls Out in 2009, their agents refused to send it out, deeming it too gross. “My manager was like, ‘I would have to get special permission from the head of the company to be able to put our covers on a script this foul,’\\u200a” Talbott recalls. At a friend’s suggestion, the duo created a rudimentary website that “looked like it had been built by a retarded robot”—hence the name—and posted the script online. Some movie executives found it and began passing it around. Within about nine months, Balls Out had enough support to land it on the Annual Black List. Since then, it’s been optioned by a production company but not yet filmed. Talbott and Spellman are psyched enough that it’s going live as a podcast. “Anytime you’re affiliated with the Black List it’s a good thing,” Spellman says. But, he adds, “until very recently, I thought podcasts were for nerds.”He’s not incorrect. Radio dramas have been around since the 1920s. They were popular entertainment in the 1940s, then died off when color TV took off in the ’50s. Now audio entertainment is making a comeback, fueled by the proliferation of podcasts such as NPR’s Serial, which set an iTunes record last year when it was quickly downloaded more than 5 million times. About 17 percent of Americans listen to podcasts each month, up from 9 percent in 2008, according to Edison Research. The average listener tunes in to six each week.Several podcasting companies have popped up, including Slate’s Panoply, Gimlet Media, and Midroll. On each, advertisers generally pay from $15 to $25 per 1,000 downloads. That’s more than three times as much as for many radio ads, largely because podcast blurbs, most of which are read or ad-libbed by hosts, are invasively effective. “People are really engaged with the content and the host,” says Adam Sachs, chief executive officer of Midroll. He’s found that 63 percent of people bought something after hearing it advertised on a podcast.“Franklin’s created an alternate to the old, very narrow, confined way of getting in”“I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t incredibly nervous about doing the podcast,” Leonard, 36, admits. Before this, he’s always been behind-the-scenes. After graduating from Harvard in 2000, he worked on a congressional campaign in Ohio, then as a McKinsey consultant in New York. When his entire analyst class was let go in 2002, he had five months of severance pay and lots of free time. One night in February 2003 he watched three of his favorite films—Being There, Amadeus, and Dr. Strangelove—then spontaneously booked a ticket to Los Angeles. “I realized I was spending all my time either reading about the film industry or watching movies,” he says. The same week he landed in L.A., he interviewed with a talent agent at Creative Artists Agency and was hired as an assistant.Leonard at a live reading.His list was born two years later as he grew frustrated reading piles of mediocre scripts. Looking to access better material, Leonard anonymously queried 75 colleagues and asked them to send their favorite screenplays. He compiled the replies, then sent out the resulting list, calling it the Black List. The name is a nod to Hollywood writers who were barred from working during the McCarthy era and an inversion of assumptions about race. “It’s a black list people want to be on,” Leonard says. A week after sending out the e-mail, he returned from vacation and found his list had been forwarded back to him more than 50 times, like a viral chain letter, by people oblivious he’d created it.The Annual Black List still works the same way, though more experts are queried and everyone in Hollywood knows Leonard is in charge. Since its inception, 987 scripts have made the list, of which 295 have been filmed, including The Imitation Game and other hits such as Slumdog Millionaire and The King’s Speech. Those produced have collectively received 223 Oscar nominations and 43 wins. Leonard’s company doesn’t take a cut when a movie gets made. “We don’t want to insert ourselves where we aren’t adding any value,” he says.The aim, Leonard says, is to ensure more good scripts get attention. In mid-March, during the taping of Balls Out, he follows along on his MacBook, trying to stifle his laughter so it doesn’t end up on the recording. After the session ends, Leonard lets out a sigh of relief. “I think that went well,” he says. “I’m excited by the medium, because it doesn’t require $100 million to make.” One day, he adds, the Black List may expand into the business of actually making films. “But for right now, I can contribute more to great movies getting made this way.”As for the Robotard 8000? The duo is working on a sequel to Balls Out. Spoiler alert: Islamic State terrorists take control of Cape Cod.'),\n",

       "  'John Bryant is a voracious cereal eater. Most mornings, he has a bowl of Kellogg’s All-Bran Buds, a spinoff of the company’s 99-year-old All-Bran, originally marketed as a “natural laxative.” At night he’s likely to snack on Honey Smacks, which is 56 percent sugar by weight. Sometimes he’ll mix it with more nutritious Frosted Mini-Wheats. Bryant also feeds the stuff to his six children. “I can assure you that we go through an enormous amount of cereal,” he says. This makes the Bryant household somewhat of an anachronism at a time when Americans have moved on to granola bars, rediscovered the virtues of hot meals such as oatmeal and eggs, and fallen under the spell of Greek yogurt. But then Bryant would probably feel guilty if he joined them. He’s chief executive officer of Kellogg, the world’s largest cereal maker, whose brands also include Frosted Flakes, Rice Krispies, Corn Flakes, Froot Loops, and Apple Jacks. Kellogg needs all the cereal eaters it can muster.On Feb. 12, Bryant, fortified by his customary helping of All-Bran, arrived at Kellogg headquarters in Battle Creek, Mich., to deliver bad news. He announced the company’s U.S. morning-foods net sales fell 8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014. It was the division’s seventh quarterly decline in a row. “It’s very frustrating,” Bryant said in a postmortem telephone interview.For almost a century, Kellogg defined the American breakfast: a moment when people would be jolted out of their drowsiness—often with a stupendous serving of sugar. Breakfast was personified by Kellogg’s cartoon mascots like Frosted Flakes’ vigorous Tony the Tiger; Froot Loops’ pig Latin–spouting Toucan Sam; and Rice Krispies’ Snap, Crackle, and Pop, a trio of elves who mischievously splashed around in a milky bowl.Behind this week’s cover.Kellogg still spends more than $1 billion a year on advertising, but it no longer has the same hold on breakfast. The sales of 19 of Kellogg’s top 25 cereals eroded last year, according to Consumer Edge Research, a Stamford (Conn.) firm that tracks the food industry. Sales of Frosted Flakes, the company’s No.\\u20091 brand, fell 4.5 percent. Frosted Mini-Wheats declined by 5 percent. Meanwhile, Special K Red Berries, one of the company’s breakout successes in the past decade, fell by 14 percent. Kellogg executives don’t expect cereal sales to return to growth this year, though they hope to slow the rate of decline and do better in 2016. But some Wall Street analysts say cereal sales may never fully recover. In Battle Creek, so-called Cereal City, that would be the equivalent of the apocalypse.The 49-year-old Bryant, who resembles a cereal box character himself with his wide eyes, toothy smile, and elongated chin, blames Kellogg’s financial woes on the changing tastes of fickle breakfast eaters. The company flourished in the Baby Boom era, when fathers went off to work and mothers stayed behind to tend to three or four children. For these women, cereal must have been heaven-sent. They could pour everybody a bowl of Corn Flakes, leave a milk carton out, and be done with breakfast, except for the dishes.Now Americans have fewer children. Both parents often work and no longer have time to linger over a serving of Apple Jacks and the local newspaper. Many people grab something on the way to work and devour it in their cars or at their desks while checking e-mail. “For a while, breakfast cereal was convenience food,” says Abigail Carroll, author of Three Squares: The Invention of the American Meal. “But convenience is relative. It’s more convenient to grab a breakfast bar, yogurt, a piece of fruit, or a breakfast sandwich at some fast-food place than to eat a bowl of breakfast cereal.”People who still eat breakfast at home favor more labor-intensive breakfasts, according to a recent Nielsen survey. They spend more time at the stove, preparing oatmeal (sales were up 3.5 percent in the first half of 2014) and eggs (up 7 percent last year). They’re putting their toasters to work, heating up frozen waffles, French toast, and pancakes (sales of these foods were up 4.5 percent in the last five years). This last inclination should be helping Kellogg: It owns Eggo frozen waffles. But Eggo sales weren’t enough to offset its slumping U.S. cereal numbers. “There has just been a massive fragmentation of the breakfast occasion,” says Julian Mellentin, director of food analysis at research firm New Nutrition Business.And Kellogg faces a more ominous trend at the table. As Americans become more health-conscious, they’re shying away from the kind of processed food baked in Kellogg’s four U.S. cereal factories. They tend to be averse to carbohydrates, which is a problem for a company selling cereal derived from corn, oats, and rice. “They basically have a carb-heavy portfolio,” says Robert Dickerson, senior packaged-food analyst at Consumer Edge. If such discerning shoppers still eat cereal, they prefer the gluten-free kind, sales of which are up 22 percent, according to Nielsen. There’s also growing suspicion of packaged-food companies that fill their products with genetically modified organisms (GMOs). For these breakfast eaters, Tony the Tiger and Toucan Sam may seem less like friendly childhood avatars and more like malevolent sugar traffickers.Bryant says Kellogg is laboring to develop cereals that will overcome these cultural shifts and end its morning misery. Some of Kellogg’s wounds, however, are self-inflicted. Its two largest competitors—General Mills, maker of Cheerios and Lucky Charms, and Post Holdings, whose brands include Grape-Nuts and Honey Bunches of Oats—are struggling with the same morning trends. Yet the decline in General Mills’ 2014 cereal sales was half as bad as Kellogg’s, and Post eked out a 2 percent increase.Kellogg’s dismal sales are indicative of the company’s larger problems. Of the 21 analysts covering Kellogg tracked by Bloomberg, 19 have a sell or a hold rating on the company’s stock. Only two recommend buying the cereal maker’s shares. It’s cut costs, only to amp up spending again. There have been three heads of U.S. breakfast foods in four years as the division’s profits fell. Bryant’s latest scheme to revive cereal sales—by adding more fruit and natural ingredients to some of its best-known brands—seems far-fetched at best. The meltdown in Battle Creek is puzzling because, until recently, the company was known as a well-managed organization. “Kellogg was perhaps the most respected consumer-product company out there,” says David Palmer, a food industry analyst at RBC Capital Markets. “They went off the rails.”  Bryant frequently pays homage to his company’s founder, Will K. Kellogg, the man who practically invented the modern idea of breakfast. Throughout much of the 19th century, Americans woke up in the morning and ate leftovers. Predictably, this caused widespread indigestion. Wealthy people often went to sanitariums for exotic cures involving enemas and hydrotherapy. Kellogg worked at just such a health spa in Battle Creek run by his older brother, Dr. John Harvey Kellogg, an eccentric wellness guru memorialized in the 1994 movie The Road to Wellville. The Kelloggs were Seventh-Day Adventists and therefore strict vegetarians. They couldn’t serve their patients eggs and bacon. So in 1894 they came up with something lighter: corn flakes. “They developed a flaking process,” says Brian Wilson, a professor of comparative religion at Western Michigan University and author of Dr. John Harvey Kellogg and the Religion of Biologic Living. “That’s the origin of the modern breakfast flake.”The Kellogg brothers were soon quarreling about what to do with the invention. W.K. Kellogg wanted to make money. In 1906 he founded Battle Creek Toasted Corn Flake Co., enlivening the taste of his cereal with sugar. His brother thought this was blasphemous. A legal battle ensued over who had the right to use the family name, and W.K. Kellogg prevailed. He introduced All-Bran in 1916. Rice Krispies followed in 1928. By then, Kellogg was a wealthy man known for his benevolence. He started a charitable foundation that supported children’s health and education. During the Depression, he changed the factories’ three eight-hour shifts to four six-hour ones to employ more people.In 1949, Kellogg hired Leo Burnett, the rumpled advertising genius who created the Jolly Green Giant and the Marlboro Man. Burnett persuaded Kellogg to promote his cereals on television, then a nascent medium. His agency was responsible for many of Kellogg’s Disney-like cartoon characters. They became as famous as the ones in the Saturday morning shows sponsored by Kellogg, such as Yogi Bear and Huckleberry Hound. In fact, Yogi and Huckleberry sometimes cavorted in Kellogg commercials. Children, many of whom watched TV with a bowl of milk-soaked Kellogg’s Sugar Pops or Frosted Flakes, were entranced. They ate cereal for breakfast, cereal for lunch, and cereal for a bedtime snack.Kellogg died at the age of 91 in 1951. By the 1970s, Kellogg’s share of the U.S. cereal market had reached 45 percent. The Federal Trade Commission said the company was too big and might need to be broken up. Nothing came of it. It was harder, though, for Kellogg to escape the consumer activists who criticized marketing junk food to youngsters. “Many of the kid-oriented cereals have a fair amount of sugar in them,” says Michael Jacobson, executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a food industry watchdog. “Their Eggo waffles are mostly white flour. Pop-Tarts are white flour and sugar. For a company that started out as a health-food company, they’ve turned into something very different.” (Kellogg says it has lowered the amount of sugar in its top-selling kids’ cereal by as much as 30 percent in the past several years.) As sugary cereals started to lose their broad appeal by the early 1990s, Kellogg forfeited its dominant position in the U.S. to General Mills, whose Cheerios were marketed as a healthier alternative.Kellogg’s fortunes rose again with the ascension of Carlos Gutierrez, a handsome Cuban-born executive with dark hair and a snowy mustache who began his career selling Frosted Flakes out of a truck to hole-in-the-wall stores in Mexico City. Gutierrez took over as the company’s CEO in 1999 and proved himself a gifted morning-food strategist. He believed that consumers would pay more for cereals they thought were better for them. He decided to push Special K, then a staid diet brand marketed to weight-conscious women. Kellogg spiced it up by introducing freeze-dried strawberries developed in the company’s Battle Creek food laboratory. Special K Red Berries became a best-seller, inspiring a plethora of extensions such as Special K Chocolatey Delight cereal, Special K Cracker Chips, and a Special K low-calorie pink lemonade mix.Kellogg also paid $33 million in 2000 for Kashi, a health-food cereal maker founded by an enterprising jazz trumpeter and his wife in La Jolla, Calif. At the time, Kashi was bringing in $25 million a year. Less than a decade later, its annual revenue had climbed to $600 million. Gutierrez made a point of keeping Kashi based in Southern California to give it some indie cred. But now that it was a division of Kellogg, the health-food purveyor no longer behaved like a mom and pop venture. It introduced Kashi Chocolate Almond Butter cookies, Kashi frozen pizzas, and other items that seemed closer and closer to processed food. In 2004, Gutierrez departed to become President George W. Bush’s Commerce secretary. After a two-year stint by James Jenness, a Kellogg director and former Leo Burnett executive, David Mackay, a balding, soft-spoken New Zealander and the company’s chief operating officer, took the top job.Kellogg’s current problems began shortly thereafter. In 2008, Mackay embarked on a $1 billion, three-year cost-cutting initiative called K-Lean, which targeted wasteful spending in the company’s factories. It was soon clear that Mackay had gone overboard. A flood at an Eggo factory in Atlanta led to a debilitating frozen waffle shortage that battered the company’s financial results in 2009. The following year, Kellogg recalled 28 million boxes of Froot Loops, Honey Smacks, and others manufactured at its Omaha plant because of an odd stench and taste the company traced to the plastic lining in the boxes. Kellogg acknowledged that some customers started their day with these cereals only to be sidelined by nausea and diarrhea. “It was horrible,” says Trevor Bidelman, president of Local 3G of the Bakery, Confectionary, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers International Union, which represents workers at the Battle Creek cereal factory. “They cut way too deep. Probably the biggest thing that hurt them was the thousands of years of experience that they ran out the door. Our plants could not run very effectively for two to three years after that.” (Kellogg says neither the flood nor the recall were related to K-Lean.)By the end of 2010, Kellogg had replaced Mackay with the more gregarious Bryant, a 13-year Kellogg veteran. His first task was to clean up the K-Lean mess. “We did cut too many people in our facilities in the U.S. network,” Bryant admitted in a conference call in November 2011. He said Kellogg was hiring 300 factory workers and adding additional waffle capacity. Some analysts listening were astonished by the disarray in Battle Creek. “It seems like the more rocks that are turned over, there is more ugly stuff underneath,” Eric Katzman, a food industry analyst at Deutsche Bank, said at the time. “It’s amazing that a company like Kellogg, with its reputation, is actually going through this.”As Kellogg flailed, General Mills strengthened its position. That year, when many Americans were choosing yogurt over Cheerios, it paid $1.1 billion for a controlling stake in Yoplait, the world’s second-largest yogurt producer. As soon as he could, Bryant made what he considered a transformative purchase. In 2012 he orchestrated Kellogg’s $2.7 billion acquisition of Pringles, the 44-year-old canned potato chip brand, from Procter & Gamble. It’s hard to imagine a product more emblematic of the processed food that American consumers were shirking. But the deal boosted Kellogg’s net sales by more than $1 billion that year, to $14 billion, and enabled Bryant to claim that Kellogg was no longer so dependent on cereal.Kellogg still counted on Frosted Flakes and its breakfast-food siblings for more than a third of its operating profits, which were dwindling. In November 2013, Bryant puzzled Wall Street by announcing a four-year cost-cutting plan with another memorable title: Project K. He vowed to eliminate 7 percent of Kellogg’s workforce and use a portion of the savings to create exciting new cereals, though he declined to provide further details at the time. Industry analysts were skeptical. “If you say you cut too much a year ago, and it didn’t lead to improved performance, then why should we believe that cutting more now will solve the longer-term issue, which is reduced demand?” Consumer Edge’s Dickerson says. In 2014, Kellogg closed a cereal plant in London, Ont., and an Australian snacks operation. Bryant has threatened to close one of its four American cereal plants this year if the bakers union won’t accept a contract enabling Kellogg to hire a new category of “transitional” workers who would be paid lower wages and be ineligible for a pension. “It is not our preferred approach,” Bryant says. “But if that’s where we end up, that’s a path we’ll have to go down.” So far the union has declined his overtures. Bidelman, a fourth-generation Kellogg employee, doesn’t think the company’s founder would have treated his factory workers so callously. “The philosophy of the company seems to have changed quite a bit,” he says. Instead, Bidelman says, Kellogg should trim Bryant’s compensation, which was $7.9 million in 2013.Morning-food sales continued to fall in 2014. Some Special K spinoffs posted double-digit declines, and the Kashi line was a particular embarrassment. Kashi Heart to Heart fell 27 percent. Kashi GoLean Crunch lost 30 percent. Analysts say that part of the problem is Kellogg’s indecisiveness with the division. In 2013 it moved Kashi from Southern California to Battle Creek, which Kellogg insisted would better position it for future growth. Then, last year, Bryant announced that Kellogg was moving Kashi back to La Jolla so the struggling unit would be closer to its roots. “Kashi is a brand that has lost its way,” says RBC’s Palmer. “Many of its varieties are not organic. Many have GMOs.”  While Bryant attacked costs, his competitors added new cereals in response to consumers’ shifting breakfast habits. In January 2014, General Mills announced GMO-free Cheerios. Post said it would release a similar version of Grape-Nuts. Kellogg says it can’t do the same with Frosted Flakes because almost all the corn made in the U.S. is genetically modified.In November, Bryant made a belated attempt to get some new breakfast fare to market, unveiling a gluten-free Special K in an earnings call. He arguably went off message, however, by making a big deal out of a new peanut butter and jelly Pop-Tart. “If I ask you do you think peanut butter and jelly Pop-Tarts are where United States food culture is headed, the answer most likely is no,” Dickerson says.In February, Bryant acknowledged that Kellogg’s U.S. snacks division was also ailing. Last year its sales declined 2 percent. This put even more pressure on him to resuscitate the cereal division, so Bryant has been pushing what he describes as a long-term rescue plan. He wants to rebrand Special K from a diet brand to a cereal for the health-conscious with new variants such as Special K Protein Cinnamon Brown Sugar Crunch. The company is also promoting Raisin Bran with Cranberries. Bob Goldin, executive vice president of Technomic, a food industry consultant, doubts that these new cereals will have a big impact on the company’s sales. “The category is pretty mature,” Goldin says. “It’s not so easy anymore to introduce a new line or do a new TV ad and life is good again.”Bryant is also determined to restore Kashi’s credibility with health-food shoppers. Kellogg already has 15 GMO-free cereals in supermarkets. It hopes to add more this year. At the same time, Kellogg’s less publicized political maneuvers aren’t helping it with anti-GMO consumers. In California, Washington, and Oregon, Kellogg is spending $1.4 million to defeat ballot initiatives that would force companies to identify GMO ingredients on their labels. Alexis Baden-Mayer, political director of the Organic Consumers Association, says Kellogg is alienating customers: “It seems counterintuitive.” Kellogg says state-by-state labeling would confuse shoppers and increase costs.Focusing on Special K and Kashi comes with the risk of neglecting older brands—the ones keeping Kellogg afloat. Even though Frosted Flakes is hardly a next-generation breakfast product, the company sold $439 million worth last year, making it the second-most popular cereal in the U.S. after General Mills’ Honey Nut Cheerios. What’s more, Kellogg increased Froot Loops sales by 3 percent, to $266 million, by marketing the technicolor rings to adults as a late-night snack. “These are not dead brands,” says Mary Zalla, global vice president of Landor Associates, a branding adviser. “There’s amazing equity in Kellogg’s name. Then they’ve got this other whole layer of value: the characters. Sometimes they have longevity. Sometimes they don’t. But think of Ronald McDonald.”Bryant isn’t worried. “The company has been around for 109 years,” he says. “We have the time. We have a plan to turn it around.” He better show results in a hurry. The consensus on Wall Street is that Kellogg is a takeover candidate. “He’s at a critical point in his career,” says Palmer of Bryant.Perhaps it’s time for the CEO to imagine what W.K. Kellogg would do. It’s doubtful the company’s founder would let things get so out of control at his factories. It’s hard to think of him taking away employee benefits. He wasn’t a trend follower: Kellogg created breakfast flakes and foresaw the power of TV advertising. There must be some way for his successors to sell breakfast food to working parents and their children who are now watching YouTube instead of Saturday morning cartoons. Bryant could always triple his All-Bran Buds consumption and entice his children to eat more cereal, too. It may not save Kellogg. But at least he’ll be able to say he went down fighting.—With Matthew Boyle'),\n",

       "  'One week into her new job, Letitia Camire learned she was pregnant. It was 2011, and she’d just been hired as the office manager for United Tool & Machine, a small, family-owned tool and die company outside Boston. Her salary was $30,000 a year. Camire clicked with her co-workers immediately. Her boss, the owner and president, started asking her about long-term career goals. “They seemed so family-oriented,” says Camire, now 32. So when her morning sickness became noticeable (“I just sat at my desk looking like death warmed over”), she felt she owed her new work family an explanation. She was only a few weeks along when she walked into the president’s office one morning, shut the door, and told him she was pregnant.“His face immediately changed,” she says. “The first words out of his mouth were, ‘You know you’re still on your 90-day probation period.’ So I pretty much knew what that meant.” A few weeks later, she was let go. The company told her it was a reorganization move, but she didn’t buy it. She knew that according to the 1978 Pregnancy Discrimination Act, firing or demoting an employee because she’s pregnant is illegal, but she also knew discrimination can be hard to prove. The U.S. Supreme Court recently considered the case of Peggy Young, a United Parcel Service employee who was forced into unpaid leave when she told her company she was pregnant and couldn’t carry packages heavier than 20 pounds. Young has lost in lower courts because UPS’s accommodation of disabilities not caused by workplace injuries is gender-neutral. The court will issue its decision later this year. “I didn’t have the financial resources to fight,” Camire says. United Tool & Machine says Camire was let go because her job was eliminated, and that the president was unaware she was pregnant at the time.Camire soon found herself in the awkward position of interviewing for jobs while pregnant. She wasn’t showing yet, but she told recruiters anyway. “I just didn’t want to waste anyone’s time,” she says. Luckily, the Israel-based electronics company Orbotech had no qualms about hiring her. Camire was a new employee, though, so she didn’t qualify for the short-term disability insurance that it, like many companies, uses as a workaround to give maternity leave. Instead, she ran through her sick days and vacation time and relied on her husband’s salary to allow her to take nine weeks off, unpaid. “We put a lot of things on credit cards,” she says. They stopped going out to dinner. They streamlined their grocery budget, drove their cars as little as possible, and gave up—for a while, anyway—the idea of saving for retirement. “Financially, I probably should’ve been back even sooner than that,” Camire says. But she couldn’t find a local day care center that would take such a young baby.Her story isn’t unusual. Unless you work for a company that voluntarily offers it, or in one of three states, paid maternity leave doesn’t exist in the U.S. A law called the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) grants up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave every year, but it applies only to full-time workers at companies with 50 or more employees. About half of all working Americans are covered by FMLA. The other half—freelancers, contract workers, entrepreneurs, people who work at small businesses—are on their own. Paid leave is even rarer: Only 12 percent of American workers have access to it in the U.S., according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.This comes as a shock to a lot of young women. “Wait, what?” Kathryn, 33, says about the moment she realized the New York media startup she’d recently joined didn’t offer maternity leave. “I thought we had laws about this.” (Kathryn asked to have her last name withheld because of a nondisclosure agreement with her former company.)Most new mothers are in their 20s or 30s, which means they grew up in a world of female Supreme Court justices, politicians, and astronauts. They have more college degrees than men, they entered the workforce in near-equal numbers, and they chose their careers assuming that having children wouldn’t mean losing money. Almost two-thirds of women with children under 6 work, about twice the rate of the previous generation. “I went to college and found something I loved. I got a job. I married and had babies and just assumed maternity leave was something that existed,” says Annalisa Spencer, 31, an electrical engineer in Salt Lake City who has three children, and got no leave for the third. “Nobody told me it would be like this.”In 2013, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) introduced legislation that would make employers offer new parents three months of paid leave at 66 percent of their salary, but the bill, the Family Act, has been stalled in Congress for more than a year. Even if it passes, it won’t fix a system that paints a huge segment of the workforce into a corner. In a country where the median household income is $53,000, 66 percent of a salary might not be enough to support a family. But the Family Act would drastically change the lives of many American workers. One of the reasons women make less than men—16¢ per dollar less, according to the Pew Research Center—is that they’re clustered in lower-paying fields, or in positions where they work fewer hours. Yet young women right out of college experience almost no gap at all. The discrepancy grows as they get older and advance—or fail to advance—in their careers. And the first bump in the road seems to happen right as they start to have children. According to the United Nations’ International Labour Organization, there are only two countries in the world that don’t have some form of legally protected, partially paid time off for working women who’ve just had a baby: Papua New Guinea and the U.S.The U.S. is also way behind the 78 countries that also offer leave to fathers. Forcing mothers back to work early can have consequences for children. When they’re on maternity leave, their children are more likely to be breast-fed and taken to the doctor for checkups. Studies have found that a year after having a baby, women who took at least a month of leave reported higher salary increases.With no federal action, some states have stepped in. Five states pay new mothers through their disability insurance programs. In 2004, California passed the country’s first paid parental leave law, open to both mothers and fathers. There, new parents get up to six weeks off at 55 percent of their current paycheck, up to about $1,000 a week. Since then, New Jersey and Rhode Island have followed.The policies vary widely across industries and pay grades. A BLS survey of “business, management, and finance” workers—basically, those in white-collar jobs—found that 26 percent of them get paid leave. At many Silicon Valley companies, which compete for talent, new parents have it made. Facebook offers a little more than four months to everyone. Google offers five for mothers and three for fathers or new adoptive parents. The company developed its policy a few years ago when it noticed that many new mothers were quitting their jobs. After it added two more months and offering full pay, the number of new mothers who left the company dropped by half.Some older companies also have generous policies. Goldman Sachs offers four paid months, and General Electric offers two months to moms and two weeks to dads or other parents. Waitresses and sales clerks are often out of luck; only 6 percent of service workers get anything at all. That means the ability to adjust to parenthood, learn to breast-feed, and manage a newborn becomes a luxury only certain people can afford. “We have these policies set up from the Mad Men era when dads worked and moms stayed at home. But that doesn’t reflect the American workforce anymore,” says Gillibrand, who as partner at the Manhattan law firm Boies, Schiller & Flexner wrote the firm’s maternity leave policy in 2002.Recently, some companies have started to offer leave to fathers. This decreases the likelihood that an employer will shy away from hiring young women, and it de-stigmatizes the idea that new dads need time off, too. In the 10 years since California adopted its policy, the number of requests submitted by men has gone up each year and stands at 26 percent. In general, the amount of time they take off is much shorter, typically no more than a week or two. And as children age, the cost of day care and nannies starts to squeeze families’ income, sometimes prompting one of the parents to go part-time or decide to stay home. Even today, that person is usually the mother.In most places, the only parent offered time off is the mother; she qualifies for short-term disability insurance after she physically gives birth. That’s what Spencer, the electrical engineer in Utah, used when she got six weeks at half pay after she had her first child. (She skipped payments on her 401(k) to take another six unpaid.) By the time her third child came along, she had dropped down to part-time so she wouldn’t have to pay so much for rising day care costs, which meant she didn’t get any maternity leave at all. “I’m hourly now, so it’s not like I’m getting paid for time I’m not working,” she says. She spent her last maternity leave working from home.Even women in high-income positions have trouble figuring out how the patchwork of policies applies to them. “I have three months of paid leave, 46 days of unused vacation time that I saved up, and then the six weeks that California offers, but I don’t know if it runs concurrently with my vacation time. It was very confusing. For a while I didn’t even know what day my leave officially ended,” Jeanette Barzelay, a civil litigation attorney in San Francisco, told me. Because Barzelay lives in California, she’s covered under the state’s paid-leave law.Despite the confusing system, Barzelay did take a lot of time off—six months, partially paid. But most people, even in California, aren’t that lucky. Colleen, a fast-talking 44-year-old television director in Los Angeles, didn’t use California’s paid leave when she had her second child in 2008 because it doesn’t include job protection. For years, she has worked 65- to 70-hour weeks with studios such as Walt Disney and Nickelodeon. (Colleen asked to have her last name withheld because she doesn’t want to jeopardize her relationship with the studios.) She’s highly paid, but as with most production workers in Hollywood, her contracts for TV shows run from week to week. Because she’s a contract employee, FMLA doesn’t cover her, and California’s law, which does, doesn’t require studios to let her keep her job. “There’s this kind of unwritten, unspoken thought that you could be replaced at any moment,” she says. So when a TV studio asked her to return to work three weeks after having a C-section, she had to show up. “I told them I needed to recover from major surgery before I go back to running around on set all day. They were like, ‘Umm, we really need you back,’\\u2009” she says. “I wasn’t in a position to argue with them.”Gillibrand’s bill would apply to every company, no matter what size, and would keep people like Camire from having to rely on credit cards or people like Colleen from working right after a C-section. It includes fathers, adoptive parents, and same-sex parents and would be paid through a new payroll tax of two-tenths of 1 percent. It’s endorsed by groups such as the National Partnership for Women and Families and the Small Business Majority. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Restaurant Association, which have historically opposed paid leave, haven’t come out against it. Furthermore, polls suggest that paid family leave is overwhelmingly supported by men and women across the political spectrum.So why is the Family Act at a standstill? Gillibrand says Congress doesn’t think it’s important enough. “The issue isn’t being raised because too many of the members of Congress were never affected by it,” she says, pointing out that 80 percent of Congress is older and male. “They’re not primary caregivers. Most members of Congress are affluent and are able to afford help or able to support their [wives]. It’s not a problem for most of them.” Hillary Clinton has also admitted that while she supports paid leave, it’s a political battle the U.S. isn’t ready to fight. “I don’t think, politically, we could get it [passed] now,” she said in a CNN town hall meeting last June.Washington won’t be able to ignore this forever. “You’re finally starting to see momentum on this issue,” says Debra Ness, president of the National Partnership for Women and Families. Over the past decade, Ness has noticed that young parents are becoming increasingly angry at the lack of employer support when they start to have children. “This will be part of the conversation during the next election,” she says. “The sleeping giant is waking up.”Before it was passed, California’s law was vehemently opposed by manufacturing and small-business associations, which argued that it would be too hard for companies with just a few employees to handle someone’s six-week absence. The California Chamber of Commerce called it a “job killer.” To get it passed, lawmakers agreed to fund the law by taxing people’s paychecks, not businesses. As a result, a 2011 survey found that 91 percent of California business owners said the law either helped or had no effect on their profitability. The National Bureau of Economic Research found that California women in low-wage jobs were more than three times as likely to take some sort of maternity leave under the law, and returned to their old jobs in higher numbers. Over time their wages were higher, too. “Businesses in California don’t seem to be reporting a strong negative effect. I haven’t seen evidence of a significant downside,” says Christopher Ruhm, a professor of public policy and economics at the University of Virginia.Gillibrand’s bill is a sweeping piece of legislation that would, as Carrie Lukas, the managing director of the conservative Independent Women’s Forum, puts it, “rewrite employment contracts for every working American.” Lukas is against the act because she’s “worried about the way it’ll change women’s employment prospects. It’s written in gender-neutral language, but every employer in their right mind knows who’s going to take advantage of these benefits.” As hard as it might be for paid-leave advocates to accept, she has a point. That’s exactly what happened in Sweden.In any discussion of parental leave, Sweden is the promised land. Parents are given 16 months of paid leave, two of which are reserved just for fathers, and they can divide the rest however they like until their child is 8 years old. While on leave, the government pays 80 percent of the parent’s income, even if she’s self-employed.“We’ve got it so good here,” says Christine Demsteader, a single mother living in Stockholm. She runs her own communications company but still took 16 months off when her only child was born a few years ago. “The thing is, we have only one system for doing things: Women take a year off, then they go back to work and the kid goes into day care,” she says. “You don’t have another option.”“And it’s understood that a woman who becomes a mother cannot have the same career as a man,” adds her friend Lisa Rydberg, who’d run over to Demsteader’s house when she heard that an American journalist was calling.For all Sweden’s efforts at gender equality, men still make about 35 percent more than women, according to a 2012 Swedish government report. And although the top five spots on the World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap index are all held by Nordic countries, their percentage of female chief executive officers is no higher than the 5 percent achieved by Fortune 500 companies in the U.S. “I just know I’d get a promotion three years later than a colleague who is a man,” says Rydberg. “That’s how it is.”Intentionally or not, Sweden seems to have routed women onto the “mommy track,” a slower, less demanding career path for women with children. In the U.S. it often comes under the guise of the purposefully vague term “caregiver status,” which companies use when offering reduced hours and a lower salary to parents who need flexibility. In academia, universities will often pause the so-called tenure clock for female professors who take time off to have children. Some of these policies can be helpful. But they also have the side effect of segregating those who use them into positions where they’re just not expected to advance.Most women try to get around this by gaming the system. A biology professor at the University of Pittsburgh planned her pregnancy so that she’d give birth during the summer, when she already had time off. (Unpaid, of course.) Colleen the TV director tried to have her kids between TV seasons; she succeeded two out of three times. Of course, this method assumes a woman gets pregnant only when she wants to, she has a healthy pregnancy and delivery, and her baby doesn’t need special care. “I had this one window when I had to have the baby,” Kate Lytton, a ballet teacher in Akron, told me. Lytton had her daughter in July and took six weeks off unpaid, but could do that only because classes weren’t in session. “When she was a week late, I worried she’d cut into my leave time.”In fields without a seasonal break, women put off having children until they’re in a senior position, then cross their fingers and hope it’s not too late. “The standard practice for women in law is to make partner first and then start a family,” says Chelsea Petersen, a partner at the law firm Perkins Coie in Seattle. Nine years ago she was 34 and a midlevel associate at the firm, which is exactly the wrong time—professionally—to have kids. “That’s when you’re really working hard, trying to prove yourself. But with my age, I couldn’t wait another seven years,” she says. A year after having her first and only child, Petersen found herself crying in a fetal position on the floor of her office, suffering from exhaustion. “Days would go by where I wouldn’t have eaten a real meal or taken care of myself for five minutes,” she says. Over the years, Perkins Coie has extended its leave policy to cover fathers and created a support group for working parents. Still, Petersen can count at least 10 women in her department who’ve left, many because the demands on their time were too much. As far as she knows, she’s the only one who had a baby, made partner, and stayed full-time.Not everyone can work as hard as Petersen. Or even wants to. “Listen, I know Sheryl Sandberg wants me to lean in,” Colleen told me. In her book Lean In and her 2010 TED Talk, the Facebook COO urged women to accept promotions or go for new jobs even when they knew they might be pregnant soon. “Well, OK, Sheryl, I think that’s a really great notion,” Colleen says. “But it’s different for us. It just flat out is. There is nothing we can do about it, because biologically it’s like, well, you’re having babies now.”Luckily, there is some middle ground between the American patchwork and Swedish sabbatical—and the best example of it is Canada. “Unlike the Scandinavian countries, Canada’s tax rate isn’t radically different from the U.S.,” says Ruhm at the University of Virginia, which means any program it has could conceivably be implemented in the U.S. “I’ve become an incrementalist—try something small, see if it’s working, and then tweak it. That’s what Canada does.” Canada passed its first national maternity leave law in 1971 and has been adjusting it ever since. In 2000 it lengthened its available leave from six months to a year. About four months of that is reserved for mothers; the rest is available to all parents. They receive 55 percent of their salary (up to an income limit), paid through the country’s unemployment insurance program, and are guaranteed their jobs when they go back to work.Gillibrand’s Family Act looks a lot like Canada’s model. And because it has never been debated or amended—the Senate Finance Committee has been quietly ignoring it for more than a year—it hasn’t yet been muddied up with loopholes or concessions. It won’t turn working motherhood into anything resembling “easy.” But it may be the closest thing to a workable solution.Nine weeks after Camire had her baby, a daughter she named Catherine, she went back to work at Orbotech. “I was like, thank God I get to talk to someone other than a lump!” she laughs. She stayed at the company for two years, where she oversaw sales and shipping. In 2013 she became pregnant with her second child. This time, Camire qualified for the company’s short-term disability pay, which allowed her six weeks off at two-thirds of her salary. (FMLA provided another six, unpaid.) Then she started thinking about the future. Day care costs for her children would run about $25,000 a year in Boston. When she factored in gas, meals, and other costs, the amount of money she’d be able to provide for her family was laughably small. So three months before she was supposed to go on maternity leave, Camire told her manager she wouldn’t be coming back.“The company was completely shocked,” she says. Sure, she could’ve taken the leave and then refused to come back afterward, but Camire didn’t want to do that. “I would’ve burned bridges personally and professionally. That sat heavily on me.”For the next few years, she’ll stay at home. Her son, Charlie, is 7 months old. Catherine is almost 3. Camire’s days are filled with diapers and bottles and nap times that never seem to align. In some ways, raising a child while working was easier, she says. “At day care, I had someone to help me figure out the developmental milestones. They’d send a note saying, y’know, Catherine takes an 8-ounce bottle now instead of 6. With Charlie, I have to figure that out on my own.” She misses Orbotech sometimes and plans to go back to work in a few years once the kids are in school. She just hopes no one minds the long employment gap on her résumé. '),\n",

       "  '2014-09-17',\n",
       "  'Steve Jobs’s office remains Steve Jobs’s office. After his death in 2011, Tim Cook, his friend and successor as Apple chief executive officer, decided to leave the sparsely decorated room on the fourth floor of 1 Infinite Loop untouched. It’s not a shrine or place of mourning, but just a space that Cook sensed no one could or should ever fill. “It felt right to leave it as it is,” he says. “That’s Steve’s office.”Almost everything else on Apple’s campus in Cupertino, Calif., is different. The executive wing once radiated nervous energy, with handlers scurrying to anticipate the whims of Apple’s temperamental co-founder. Now there’s tranquility in the hallways, a reflection of the new boss’s calm Southern demeanor. Downstairs, the cafeterias are packed—the workforce has almost doubled. A mile away, behind a ring of fences, construction crews are building the massive foundation for the circular “spaceship” campus that will accommodate 12,000 workers when it’s completed in a few years.Until Sept. 9, all the other changes at the world’s most valuable and scrutinized company were largely invisible to the public. Then Tim Cook took the stage at the Flint Center for the Performing Arts and laid out much of what Apple has been working on over the past three years. The immediate aftermath is that Apple is swamped by a record number of preorders for the new iPhone 6 and supersize 6 Plus. Bank of America, Capital One, JPMorgan Chase, andWells Fargo, among other banks, plus the major credit card companies and a number of nationwide retailers, have embraced the new mobile payment system, Apple Pay. Even the Apple Watch, the company’s first attempt at launching an entirely new product category in the Cook era, has garnered an encouraging early response, though it will face the only test that matters when it hits stores sometime in 2015.Cook is eager to declare all this as a decisive victory. “Anybody coming out of there yesterday knows that innovation is alive and well in Cupertino,” he says, rocking back and forth in a conference-room chair next to his office, an Apple Watch on his wrist. “If there were any doubts, I think that they should be put to bed.”Behind the product announcements is a different story. When Cook took over from Jobs three years ago, the chances he could continue Apple’s epic run appeared slim. The iPhone accounted for more than half of Apple’s revenue and the bulk of its gross profit. At the same time the rise of phones made by Samsung Electronics and other companies that ran Google’s free Android operating system had left Apple with a shrinking stake of the smartphone market. A huge part of Apple’s business hinged on what seemed like a doomed strategy, evoking its defeat to Microsoft Windows in the PC battle of the 1980s and ’90s.Cook’s professional background is in managing supply chains, not changing the character of sprawling, complicated, ego-filled organizations. Yet three years later, veteran Apple executives repeatedly and emphatically say they want the new boss to get credit for pulling off one of the more improbable high wire acts in business history. “I feel damn proud to be working as a part of Tim’s team,” says Eddy Cue, senior vice president for Internet software and services. “If he gets a little bit of recognition from the outside world, that is great. He deserves a lot more than he is going to get.”Cook didn’t take control of Apple under anything like ideal circumstances. “Even though Tim accepted the responsibility of being CEO with all the enthusiasm you’d expect,” says Robert Iger, Walt Disney’s CEO and a member of Apple’s board, “it was dampened by a very deep sense of mourning. It made the transition hard, not just for Tim but everybody initially. He had a lot to prove.”The company Cook inherited was broken up into specialized groups devoted to hardware, software design, marketing, and finance, all working separately and sharing little information with each other; they didn’t need to because the overarching vision resided in Jobs’s head. After Jobs died, say several people who were there at the time, it wasn’t clear such a decentralized structure could survive without a powerful guiding voice at the top. For the first few months, no one had a clear mandate to make big decisions, and teams were tussling for turf.The decisive moment for Cook came at the end of his first year as CEO when he fired Scott Forstall, one of Jobs’s most trusted lieutenants. Forstall had led software development for the iPad and iPhone; he was also divisive and responsible for the poorly received Apple Maps and Siri voice recognition service. There was an audible gasp in Apple’s offices when the dismissal was announced, say people who were there. Cook immediately convened meetings with senior managers to explain how the new structure was going to work. Jonathan Ive, Apple’s head of design, was given control over the look and feel of iOS while development of the mobile operating system was consolidated with Mac software under Craig Federighi, the senior vice president for software engineering.It was a plan designed to break down walls and extinguish infighting, executed with precision. Cook says he has “nothing bad to say” about Forstall and “has no regrets.”A decade ago, when he first became a public figure, Cook, now 53, was often caricatured as Jobs’s logical, icy sidekick—the Spock to his Kirk. In person, Cook defies those expectations. He bounds toward Apple employees, posing for on-campus selfies and answering every question regardless of the holes it eats into his schedule. He can also be quite emotional about a range of subjects close to his heart, from Auburn University football to social justice. It’s easy to project this unfailing politeness onto Apple and deduce that the CEO’s demeanor has trickled down to the corporate ethos. But this gives Cook too little credit.Collaboration may be a virtue, but Cook insists it’s more of a strategic imperative. Aligning thousands of employees is crucial now that “the lines between hardware, software, and services are blurred or are disappearing,” he says. “The only way you can pull this off is when everyone is working together well. And not just working together well but almost blending together so that you can’t tell where people are working anymore, because they are so focused on a great experience that they are not taking functional views of things.”The result is only now becoming apparent with services that work across different Apple devices. Embedded in the iPhone 6 and the new iOS 8 and Mac OS X Yosemite operating system is a feature called Continuity, which lets users start an e-mail or some other task on their Mac, pick it up on their iPhone, and then move it to their iPad or even the Apple Watch. “We would never have gotten there in the old model,” Cook says. These new products are reminders “of why we exist. The things we should be doing at Apple are things that others can’t.”With the Apple Pay service, users will be able to touch their finger to the Touch ID finger scanner on their iPhone, tap their handset against a credit card terminal, and make a payment without having to turn on their phone or open an app. It’s another illustration of Cook’s focus on products that combine hardware, software, and services—and it’s an important test for the company. Apple doesn’t have a stellar track record when it comes to making easy-to-use services. Products such as iCloud, iTunes, and Siri lack the intuitive polish of Apple’s devices, and customers aren’t likely to be as forgiving when the stakes are raised from organizing photos to ensuring the security of their financial transactions.The new iPhones use a technology called near field communication that employs a short-range wireless signal to transmit data from the handset to a store’s payment terminal. Software keeps a person’s credit card information inside the phone and ensures it’s never shared directly with the merchant. Led by Jennifer Bailey, a vice president who had overseen Apple’s online store, the company started pitching this system early last year to banks, credit card companies, and retailers as more secure, more intuitive, and, unlike previous mobile payment systems, more likely to actually be used by tens of millions of iPhone owners. As a result, Apple signed up the largest banks, credit card companies, and national chains such as McDonald’s and Walgreen. “They set out to do something from Day One with substantial scale,” says James Anderson, MasterCard’s senior vice president for mobile and emerging payments. “They had a vision for how it was going to work and a vision for how simple it had to be.”Cook’s culture hasn’t suited everybody. To one former senior designer, accustomed to spitballing sessions with Jobs to go over details as minute as the look of screen icons, the company no longer has the same allure. He says he left because Apple grew too large and that products once created in small groups are now done in sprawling teams. Others chafe at Cook’s insistence on financial discipline; in meetings once devoted to the hallowed act of reviewing products, he asks managers pointed questions about spending and hiring projections, says a person involved. Staff from finance and operations now sit alongside engineers and designers in product road map sessions with key component partners.Cook also continues to micromanage areas at Apple where he has the most expertise. He still holds Friday afternoon meetings with senior managers in charge of the company’s vast supply chain, much to the chagrin of some who’d hoped his attendance, and mercilessly detailed questions, would fall off after he became CEO. “Excuse my September allergies,” says Jony Ive, rubbing his nose as he settles into a black leather seat in Apple’s executive offices. Ive has become a design legend over the past 15 years, having overseen the look and feel of the original iPod (2001), iPhone (2007), and iPad (2010). His very name—three syllables, no unnecessary letters—fits his minimalist aesthetic. He has the delicate voice and precise diction you’d expect, but he’s thickly built, and in suede chukka boots, loose-fitting blue-and-white-striped painter’s pants, and blue T-shirt with glasses hanging from his neck, the world’s most famous designer could easily be mistaken for the guy who fixes your sink.With an Apple Watch wrapped around his hand brass-knuckle style, Ive reveals that the project was conceived in his lab three years ago, shortly after Jobs’s death and before “wearables” became a buzzword in Silicon Valley. “It’s probably one of the most difficult projects I have ever worked on,” he says. There are numerous reasons for this—the complexity of the engineering, the need for new physical interactions between the watch and the human body—but the one most pertinent to Ive is that the Apple Watch is the first Apple product that looks more like the past than the future. The company invited a series of watch historians to Cupertino to speak, including French author Dominique Fléchon, an expert in antique timepieces. Fléchon says only that the “discussion included the philosophy of instruments for measuring time” and notes that the Apple Watch may not be as timeless as some classic Swiss watches: “The evolution of the technologies will render very quickly the Apple Watch obsolete,” he says.Ive, 47, immersed himself in horological history. Clocks first popped up on top of towers in the center of towns and over time were gradually miniaturized, appearing on belt buckles, as neck pendants, and inside trouser pockets. They eventually migrated to the wrist, first as a way for ship captains to tell time while keeping their hands firmly locked on the wheel. “What was interesting is that it took centuries to find the wrist and then it didn’t go anywhere else,” Ive says. “I would argue the wrist is the right place for the technology.”Ive’s team first tried using the same pinch-to-zoom touchscreen they’d invented for the iPhone, but the screen was too small and their fingers obscured the display. A year into the project, the group started toying with what became the Apple Watch’s defining physical feature: “the digital crown,” a variation on the knob that’s used to wind and set the time on a traditional wristwatch. By pressing or rotating the crown, Apple Watch users can return to the home screen, zoom in or out, and scroll through apps.Watches are as much about fashion as functionality. Ive and his colleagues indulged their obsession for detail and designed three collections of devices made of different materials and seven watchbands with their own features and flourishes. Ive handles each of the watches with the proud familiarity of a father, demonstrating, for example, how links can be plucked off a stainless steel band by pressing two buttons, no specialized jeweler’s tool required. In another bit of engineering cleverness, the watch’s packaging doubles as a charging stand; wearers nestle the watch against an inductive magnet inside the watch box to recharge it. (How often they’ll have to recharge remains unknown. Apple hasn’t yet announced specs on the watches’ battery life.)By last summer, with Apple’s stock down by as much as 40 percent from a record high because of concerns about the lack of new products, Cook was ready to accelerate the project. (The stock, now at around $100, has recovered all that ground and then some.) Apple insiders say that while an executive named Dan Riccio, who leads hardware engineering, would have been the obvious choice to take over the Watch program, Cook assigned it to Jeff Williams, 51, senior vice president for operations. Williams is Cook’s go-to guy—he vets possible acquisitions, coordinates withFoxconn Technology and other manufacturers, and oversees the logistics needed to get millions of devices from Asian factories to stores around the world. He’s an uncanny Cook clone: tall, soft-spoken, and an avid fitness buff with an inexhaustible memory for operational details. Both men have MBAs from Duke University and spent early parts of their careers at IBM. In the new Apple, he’s Tim Cook’s Tim Cook.Williams took over a team that had little in common with the small groups that created the Macintosh and iPhone, which considered themselves renegades operating in secrecy from other colleagues. The watch team included hundreds of engineers, designers, and marketing people and was the kind of cross-company interdisciplinary team now common under Cook. Apple, which has more than 1,000 chip designers, built the new S1 processor that powers the watch. Metallurgists responsible for the casing for Macs and iPhones devised a stronger gold alloy for the premium model of the watch, and Apple’s algorithm scientists studied how to improve the accuracy of the watch’s heart rate sensor.Williams is unapologetic about the Apple Watch missing the 2014 holiday season. “We want to make the best product in the world,” he says. “One of our competitors is on their fourth or fifth attempt, but nobody is wearing them.” Cook also preaches patience. “We could have done the watch much earlier, honestly, but not at the fit and finish and quality and integration of these products,” he says. “And so we are willing to wait.”Critics of Apple—they do exist—say the watch’s user interface is confusing and that it’s not entirely clear whether there’s a “killer app” or what, if anything, the watch does better than a smartphone. Prices start at $349, which is more than most users will pay for an iPhone 6 with a two-year contract.Cook says he wishes he could make the device more affordable, particularly since the company boasts of its potential to help customers manage their health and wellness (“that’s the humanitarian coming out”), but he won’t compromise Apple’s large profit margins to make it happen. (Cook theorizes that employers eager to see their workers become healthier may subsidize the device.) Then there are fashion considerations. “Some men will find it to be a little too feminine and some women will find it too bulky and possibly too masculine,” says Gadi Amit, president of the San Francisco firm NewDealDesign.Cook sees the watch as a way for customers to manage their fitness and improve their daily lives and as an ever-present remote control for their televisions, home appliances, and online relationships. “I think it’s the beginning of a very long run,” he says.At Apple’s March shareholder meeting, a representative from the conservative National Center for Public Policy Research questioned Cook on Apple’s commitment to making its factories carbon neutral and removing harmful chemicals from its products. What was the return on investment? Cook showed an uncharacteristic flash of real anger. “I don’t consider the bloody ROI,” he said. “If you want me to do things only for ROI reasons, you should get out of this stock.” The crowd erupted into raucous applause.Last year Cook hired Lisa Jackson, the former director of the Environmental Protection Agency, to lead Apple’s environmental initiatives. And he hasn’t met an in-house environmental impact video he hasn’t lovingly embraced, narrating them personally in his Alabama baritone. Jobs sometimes gestured toward caring about stuff like Apple’s climate impact, too—when he wasn’t dismissing it as “bulls-\\u200d-\\u200d-,” as he did in 2005 in response to criticism that the company didn’t do enough to limit the chemicals in its products or make them more recyclable.One of Cook’s mantras is that Apple should “default to open” on issues of corporate responsibility and engage on causes that are important to customers. In the old Apple, “it was the ‘just be quiet, just say nothing, only talk about things that are completed,’” Cook says. “My view is that that doesn’t work in things involving social responsibility. … I’m going to be 100 percent transparent.” (Alas, that transparency stops at Apple’s product plans. On those, he’d “like to find a way to be more secretive, but unfortunately the rumor mill goes a little beyond me.”)In August, Apple released its internal diversity report. Its employment numbers were lopsided toward white and Asian men. “There was a view we shouldn’t” release the report, Cook says. “I didn’t agree. … It clearly says we’re not a perfect company, and we have work to do. And that’s fine.” The company continues to struggle with conditions at its factories in China, with an internal audit this year documenting use of underage laborers and abuse of migrant workers.There’s another kind of openness at Apple as well. Cook is more willing to acknowledge weaknesses in its business and, when necessary, seek outside partnerships to boost demand for products. In July the company linked up with IBM, its original arch nemesis, to sell iPads and iPhones to large companies and develop industry-specific productivity apps. The deal was an acknowledgment that Apple needs to find new ways to sell its devices, particularly the iPad, which accounted for 20 percent of its sales last year and has hit a surprising slump in recent quarters. Ginni Rometty, IBM’s chief executive, calls Cook the “hallmark of a modern-day CEO. It’s all about clarity of vision and knowing what to do and what not to do.”Cook had decided that Apple needed more corporate customers but didn’t want to add the requisite army of buttoned-up salespeople. So he found a partner. Cook says the IBM venture is the perfect deal, because it plays to both companies’ strengths and there’s little competitive overlap. “I don’t want 100,000 people that do consulting,” he says. And an IBM smartwatch? “You wouldn’t want to see it. It would be awful,” Cook says. “I think [Rometty] would admit that.”Apple learned to play well with others the hard way—from working with hundreds of wireless carriers such as AT&T over the last few years. Apple’s carrier partners are a little like younger brothers: congenitally put upon, thoroughly dominated, but ultimately along for a tremendous ride. The carriers say Apple under Cook can still be imposing and secretive, though now there’s more of a personal touch. “Tim’s a tough negotiator,” says Glenn Lurie, CEO of AT&T Mobility, who’s been working with Cook since before the release of the iPhone in 2007. “He’s a very consistent guy, and that makes it a lot easier to do business with him.” Apple is also more willing to seek another kind of outside help. Over the last few months, the company’s gone on a hiring spree, vacuuming up accomplished tastemakers such as Patrick Pruniaux, the chief salesman at watchmaker Tag Heuer; Paul Deneve, the former CEO of couture house Yves Saint\\u202fLaurent; and Angela Ahrendts, Burberry’s former chief executive, who joined Apple to run its stores.The recruitment spree isn’t only about finding people who know how to sell watches at extravagant markups, but also about adding a diversity of views inside the company. Cook “is very focused on finding a very wide range of people,” says Susan Wagner, founding partner and director of asset-management firm BlackRock, Apple’s largest shareholder, who joined the company’s board earlier this summer. “It’s not automatically the way you think about diversity. It’s about bringing in experience, skill set, and perspective.”Cook “is comfortable enough to say ‘we need help here,’ and then he goes out and gets it,” says Jimmy Iovine, who became a part of the talent wave, along with Dr. Dre, the hip-hop impresario, when Apple acquired their company, Beats Electronics, in May for $3 billion, the biggest acquisition in the company’s history.In Beats, Apple got a business in fashionable (some might say overpriced) headphones and wireless speakers that brought in more than a billion dollars in revenue last year. Yet Cook says he bought the company for another reason—to enlist its brokers of cool to help Apple reestablish its core franchise in digital music amid the decline of single track downloads on iTunes and the rise of streaming music services such as Pandora. “The recording industry desperately needs a delivery system that is as compelling as the music,” says Iovine, nestled among celebrities and journalists after Apple’s product introduction in the blindingly white demo hall that the company constructed next to the Flint Center.As he speaks, Gwen Stefani is trying to get his attention, but Iovine doesn’t notice. He’s engrossed in describing his new colleagues’ quest to sell high-fashion, high-tech merchandise. “These guys don’t want to just hire it,” he says. “They want to understand it. They want our input. They’ve been all over us for input.”Cook concedes that consumers will issue the ultimate verdict on the Apple Watch, his biggest bet so far as chief executive. “You don’t really know on that first day or first weekend,” he says. “With things that are new, it’s not like a movie, where you can look at that first weekend and draw the line.” If consumers are befuddled or ambivalent, the questions about his product chops, and Apple’s ability to innovate, will return with a new ferocity.He’s also likely to face challenges retaining Apple’s top talent. Longtime execs such as Philip Schiller, the marketing chief, and Eddy Cue, who runs iTunes and the App Store, are worth hundreds of millions and could easily retire to spend more time with their car collections. Ive owns Jobs’s 15-seat Gulfstream jet, which he bought from Jobs’s widow at a significant discount, according to a person with knowledge of the transaction. As Ive, who helped Jobs decorate the interior, joked to a friend, “At least I don’t have to redesign anything.”Some former Apple executives think Ive could be inching toward the door and interpret the recent hiring of celebrity designer Marc Newson, Ive’s friend, as evidence he may be staying put for now. An Apple spokeswoman declines to comment on Ive’s plans, and Schiller says the team is staying together. “A lot of us at Apple are here because we love the products,” he says. “We think we are making the best products we have ever made as a company.”For now Cook is just trying to capitalize on the attention and enjoy the moment he worked the past three years for. Backstage at the Flint Center before the Sept. 9 event, he could be found with his white earbuds on, psyching himself up by listening to the OneRepublic song I Lived on his iPhone. “Hope when you take that jump, you don’t fear the fall … / Hope when the crowd screams out, they’re screaming your name.” '),\n",
       " (\"Chinese Media Go After Fox Host's Racial Slur\",\n",
       "  '2014-07-15',\n",
       "  'Bob Beckel, the Chinese are on to you. Beckel, campaign manager for Walter Mondale’s Democratic presidential run in 1984 and now a token liberal at Fox News, used a slur last Thursday when speaking of China’s threat to American security. “As usual, we bring them over here and we teach a bunch of Chinamen—er, Chinese people—how to do computers, and then they go back to China and hack into us,” Beckel said.That has prompted an outcry from Chinese Americans and calls for Beckel to resign. The clamor may get louder now that media in China have picked up on the story. On Monday, CCTV, the state-owned television broadcaster, aired a segment from the Fox show; Hong Kong’s South China Morning Post reported that after CCTV reposted its report on Weibo, China’s answer to (banned-by-Chinese-censors) Twitter, the viewing quickly drew more than 1,000 comments.The official English-language newspaper, the China Daily, interviewed Shi Yinghong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University of China. According to the newspaper, “Shi said Beckel’s speech was unacceptable to all Chinese [and] expressed his support for the Chinese communities’ call for Beckel’s resignation and apology, saying Fox News has the responsibility to urge Beckel to apologize and handle the aftermath.”In addressing the uproar, Beckel and his bosses at Fox might need to borrow a page from the Disney playbook. Last year, Jimmy Kimmel, late-night host on Disney-owned ABC, was at the center of a similar storm after airing a lame spot in which a kid suggested killing everyone in China as a way to fix America’s financial woes. Disney, which has a theme park in Hong Kong and is working on another one in Shanghai, couldn’t risk the furor gaining momentum and leading to boycotts of Mickey Mouse and Winnie the Pooh toys by Chinese parents. ABC issued what it called a “heartfelt, sincere apology,” and the controversy soon fizzled out.Beckel made a half-hearted effort yesterday. “I made some comments last week about Chinese people which apparently upset some people, for which I apologize,” he said, according to a report in the Huffington Post. “However I do not apologize for things I’ve said about China and won’t go into the litany of it now because there’s too many China apologists in this country.”Fortunately for Beckel, Rupert Murdoch’s plans for China are not as ambitious as those of Disney. News Corp. has been retreating from China’s market, where regulators have been slow to open up to foreign broadcasters. Last year the company sold its remaining stake in a Chinese satellite TV operator and 21st Century Fox has just unloaded a 19.3 percent stake in Beijing-based movie producer and distributor Bona Film Group. (News Corp. had purchased 19.9 percent of the company in 2012.) Still, with China’s movie audience such a powerful force at the box office, Murdoch can’t afford to write off China completely.In reporting on the controversy, China’s state media made a faux pas of its own. The China Daily quoted from a statement issued by California Democrat Ted Lieu, a child of immigrants who is running for the House this year to replace retiring Representative  Henry Waxman. The China Daily told its readers that Lieu, “if elected, would be the third Chinese Congressman in US history.” The paper ought to have said Chinese American, not “Chinese.” Note to Fox News commentators and China Daily editors alike: In the immortal words of Avenue Q‘s Kate Monster: Be more careful when talking about the sensitive subject of race.'),\n",
       " ('Aereo Is Finished, and the Future of TV Looks Fine',\n",
       "  '2014-06-25',\n",
       "  'Aereo’s chief executive, Chet Kanojia, reacted to his loss at the Supreme Court by warning of the ruling’s potential chilling effect on technologists, and plenty of observers took up that call. Nicco Mele of Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government likened the decision to the demise of Napster, which in his view allowed music companies to end a short-term threat while ignoring broader shifts in consumer tastes. And we all know how that worked out.So is Aereo the new Napster? To determine whether the decision will have more profound effects over time, you have to ask two questions:• Will the ruling scare companies away from developing new ways to watch television?• Will the ruling allow incumbents to sit on their laurels, deciding against making products that people want because those products would challenge their existing business models?The answer to both of these questions seems to be no. It certainly seems as if the Supreme Court will scare Aereo away from its current course. The company could actually continue to operate its antenna farms and sell subscriptions to its users, but it would have to pay broadcast companies for the right to use their content. This would entail a monthly cost of about $1 per channel per customer in retransmission fees. Aereo probably couldn’t afford this unless it charged significantly more for its service; its business model was based on keeping prices low by not paying these fees.But one of the company’s competitors, FilmOn, says the Supreme Court actually improved FilmOn’s own position by ruling that companies such as Aereo function as cable operators. Alki David, chief executive of FilmOn, says he has been unable to get broadcasters to allow the company to access their content even if it paid rebroadcast fees. Broadcasters are required to license their content to cable companies, he says, so some version of Aereo’s model could live on. “You charge people $15 for the service,” he says, “and then you figure out the costs.”The Supreme Court may also have left some openings for businesses that are slightly different than Aereo. As Justice Antonin Scalia argues in his dissenting opinion, the majority ruling found that Aereo broke the law by offering live television, much like a cable company, but without paying the retransmission fees. If a service offers broadcast content on a delay, does it still fail this cable-comparison test? Scalia thinks not: “Consider the implications of that answer: Aereo would be free to do exactly what it is doing right now so long as it built mandatory time shifting into its ‘watch’ function,” he writes.Given the increasing ubiquity of time-shifting behavior, where people watch shows on their own schedules, such a service might actually be very popular—even if any business pursuing such a model might want to factor in the possibility that it would spend a lot of time in court. But it would likely preclude innovation in one key area: live sports. In a brief supporting the broadcasters, the National Football League and Major League Baseball laid out a scenario in which Aereo could set up antennas across the country, then charge people for access to all local broadcasts. This is the kind of service that Mele is talking about when he compares Aereo to Napster: It would be appealing to viewers and threatening to broadcasters, who restrict access that customers want in order to protect their existing deals. If there’s one specific area where the court has cut off an attractive service, this is probably it.So that’s how the decision will affect new companies. But will the presumed death of Aereo lull the incumbent television industry into complacency? Unlikely. Aereo was a minor player in the drama surrounding the television industry, which still has plenty to worry about. The number of people who paid for television through cable, satellite, or fiber providers fell last year for the first time, largely due to online services such as Netflix. There is a steady flow of new mobile TV offering and alternatives to the traditional cable bundle, such as Dish Network’s deal with Disney to provide an Internet-based competitor to cable.Aereo did push broadcasters to think about how they could move more aggressively into new formats, if for no other reason than to deprive the company from accessing their content. “Some of these discussions that have been in the background for a long time came to the forefront,” says Robin Flynn of SNL Kagan. “Those things wouldn’t have happened if Aereo wasn’t pushing the model.”But the industry knows a reckoning is coming, in one form or another.'),\n",
       " (\"Aereo's Day in Court Won't End TV as We Know It\",\n",
       "  '2014-04-21',\n",
       "  'The Supreme Court will ponder the future of television on Tuesday when it hears arguments about the legality of Aereo, an Internet-television service. If the court says Aereo’s current operations are illegal, it’s curtains for the company. On the other hand, a ruling that Aereo is legal could tilt the balance of the TV industry in favor of the cord cutters, ushering in a revolution in the way we watch—and pay for—television service. Or not: Aereo may well convince the courts that it is legal and ultimately lead to little or no change in television.The legal issue at play is whether Aereo is violating broadcasters’ copyrights by setting up farms of tiny antennas and then renting access to each one to its subscribers. The business model itself is a fun thought experiment (if you like semantics), and you can read about the legal arguments here and here. The economic issue is that Aereo doesn’t pay broadcasters the retransmission fees they get elsewhere. These fees are a relatively new revenue stream for broadcasters—satellite companies began paying them about a decade ago while trying to lure people away from cable—but they’ve become increasingly important. Broadcasters’ revenue from the fees will reach $4 billion this year, according to SNL Kagan.That’s a big pot of money, and it explains why the broadcast industry has been fighting so hard to persuade the courts to drive Aereo out of business. But the claim that the company poses a more fundamental threat to the pay-TV industry is flawed in several ways.1. Aereo doesn’t have the TV people want to watch. The pay-television industry is facing a sea change. Last year was the first time the number of people who paid for television service declined, largely because viewers have online options that are good enough. Aereo is one of those options, offering a handful of channels for an $8 monthly subscription. But because it has access only to content that it can pick up with an antenna, the available content is limited. (Aereo does offer one cable channel: Bloomberg TV, which is run by Bloomberg LP, which owns Bloomberg Businessweek.)Aereo isn’t the only company offering DVRs that can access broadcast signals through digital antennas. It faces competition from companies such as TiVO, Simple.TV, and Tablo. But a company pitching a service that offers only broadcast channels suffers from the same problem: The type of content sent over the airwaves has been losing ground to cable for years.Naveen Chopra, TiVo’s chief financial officer, was asked last month at a conference whether he saw Aereo as a competitor. Chopra said he wasn’t concerned, since relatively few people are willing to abandon cable if that means losing out on entertainment like HBO and Monday Night Football on ESPN. “That’s the reason why you still have very limited change in the overall penetration of pay television, and that’s really the market we’re focused on,” he said.2. Aereo may not be strong enough to compete. The startup currently offers service in 11 cities, with plans to ramp up significantly once the legal ambiguity clears. To that end, it has raised about $100 million in investment. But there are signs Aereo is straining to serve its customers. It ran out of capacity in New York earlier this year and had to temporarily stop accepting new subscribers. The company declined at the time to disclose its local subscriber numbers, and so it remains unclear how much demand it took to overwhelm the system. (Aereo quickly added more New York antennas and began accepting new users.)Expansion is going to be very expensive. Streaming media doesn’t have great economies of scale. Every customer Aereo adds means another antenna and additional traffic. With people expecting real-time video streams, this isn’t an easy task. Whether Aereo can even take advantage of a potential legal victory is an open question.That’s why some people see Aereo as a bit player in its own story. The real danger to broadcasters is that deep-pocketed cable companies or larger Internet companies will integrate some form of Aereo’s antenna-farm concept into a broader attack on the television industry. “Aereo doesn’t have the name recognition or the reach to really disrupt the market,” says digital media analyst Dan Rayburn. “The reason the broadcasters are fighting this is that they’re worried about the idea.”3. Legal questions aren’t the only barriers. Broadcasters have a way to end this entire thing. They’ve threatened to pull their programming from the airwaves, transmitting only through cable, to keep Aereo from accessing their shows. “If the government wants to give them permission to steal our signal, then we will come up with some other way to get them our content and still get paid for it,” said CBS Chief Executive Officer Leslie Moonves at a conference last month.There could be some serious political problems with this idea, and broadcasters might be bluffing. But if the companies were to follow through, Aereo viewers would be left without anything to watch (except Bloomberg TV). In any case, a significant Internet-based alternative to television isn’t going to emerge without some cooperation from the companies that make the shows. The media business is made up of tightly wound conglomerates that can use one business to scuttle plans that threaten another. Walt Disney, which is suing Aereo, owns ESPN, and the sports juggernaut would presumably be a vital part of any Internet service with mainstream appeal. Everyone involved has a stake in maintaining some semblance of the current pay-TV system.At the very least, paying to distribute content that people want is going to be very expensive. “There’s just no way that Aereo can add more channels and charge the prices they’re offering,” says Robin Flynn of research firm SNL Kagan.Trying to sort through these various interests has already frustrated Google, Intel, and others. It seems unlikely that any broad Internet-TV service is imminent, despite years of effort. Being able to beam broadcast TV over the Internet without paying retransmission fees isn’t necessarily going to be a game changer. “Aereo is certainly not the first company to think about doing this,” Flynn says. “It’s really hard to do, which is why it hasn’t happened.”'),\n",
       " ('Islamophobia, Business, and the Brandeis Mess: Four Blunt Points',\n",
       "  '2014-04-11',\n",
       "  'Brandeis University’s decision to rescind a planned honorary degree for Ayaan Hirsi Ali, a prominent anti-Islam activist and writer, provoked a predictable explosion of indignation as well as some praise. One writer on FoxNews.com accused Brandeis of committing “an honor killing.”I wrote a book a few years ago on Muslim life in America, a project that put me in the same public radio studios as Ali, who happened to be promoting her own book at the time. Thus, permit me four blunt points on the latest controversy surrounding this contentious public figure.1. Ayaan Hirsi Ali is a professional provocateur. In speeches, articles, and books, her slashing attacks on the entirety of a global religion invite unreasoned invective—such as the notion that Brandeis “killed” her—not rational thought. Islam, she argues, constitutes “a destructive, nihilistic cult of death.” That’s not an invitation to discussion. Brandeis made a mistake proposing to honor Ali, and then wisdom prevailed. “We cannot overlook that certain of her past statements are inconsistent with Brandeis University’s core values,” the school said in a statement released eight days after it initially announced Ali would get the honorary degree at a commencement ceremony on May 18.2. Ali participates in a broader anti-Islam business. In search of grant money and individual donations, this cottage industry generates hatred and misunderstanding from think tanks, investigative groups, and Washington congressional offices. Ali’s base, the conservative American Enterprise Institute, hosts a number of brilliant thinkers and advocates on the right. She is not one of them.Her well-documented personal experiences give her ample grounds to reject the religion of her youth. A native of Somalia, she has recounted undergoing genital cutting and being pressured to marry a man against her wishes. Years later, after moving to the Netherlands, her friend and collaborator, the film director Theo van Gogh, was brutally murdered by a radical Muslim who threatened to kill Ali, too. She has campaigned against female honor killings—the real kind—in African and Arab countries. Her feminist activism deserves applause. As for religion, she’s entitled to her anti-Islam ill will, as refugees from intolerant fundamentalist brands of Christianity and Judaism are entitled to their alienation.But Ali’s making a career of condemning all of Islam and all Muslims is a sad misuse of her considerable talents. “I think we are at war with Islam,” she has said. As conservative politicians such as former President George W. Bush have noted, that kind of belligerence doesn’t make sense. The legitimate fight is against terroristic factions of Muslims, not against a religion that’s more than a billion strong.3. The unfocused bigotry that Ali encourages is bad for American business. Predominantly Muslim countries purchase goods and services on the world market. Their governments and corporate leaders have choices. Islam-haters in the U.S. cannot be helping American companies compete. The Muslim tourism market is estimated at more than $100 billion a year. Rather than visit Turkey or Malaysia, Muslim families of means could tour Disney World. Or send their children to American universities—like Brandeis. Promoting Ali’s ideas doesn’t help.4. This isn’t a question of free expression or the First Amendment. “Justice Louis D. Brandeis would be turning over in his grave,” declared Anne Neal, president of the American Council of Trustees and Alumni. “The university named after the former Supreme Court justice has illustrated the depths of small-minded bigotry and intolerance that now represent the culture on many campuses.” Neal added: “How ironic that it was Justice Brandeis himself who understood that the essence of the free exchange of ideas—something to which virtually all universities nominally adhere—is ‘to expose through discussion the falsehood and fallacies,’ not by ‘enforced silence.’”Please. Ali has no difficulty finding a soapbox courtesy of Fox News or American Enterprise. Brandeis has even invited her to visit its campus to voice her views. The university has simply decided not to honor those views by awarding her a degree.Let the debate continue.'),\n",
       " ('Six Takeaways from the Comcast-Time Warner Cable Deal',\n",
       "  '2014-02-13',\n",
       "  'News of Comcast’s agreement to buy Time Warner Cable for $45.2 billion may have come as a surprise to many. Here are some quick thoughts on what it might mean.This might actually be good for consumers. Comcast and Time Warner Cable are both among America’s most hated companies from a customer service point of view, so it would seem only natural for consumers to assume that this is a raw deal for them. Maybe not.Comcast has better technology—and more importantly, more money to spend—than TWC. By joining forces, a larger, combined company could help bring consumers into the future at a faster rate. A bigger company could also be a check on content providers. When the likes of CBS, Disney, and Discovery ask for higher subscription fees, Comcast could help keep customer bills lower by keeping those sub fees lower. Additionally, Comcast and TWC have almost no overlap in local cable markets, so customers won’t be losing their current choices.This might be bad for Netflix, Hulu, and YouTube. A merged company would be by far the biggest Internet provider in the country, giving them almost monopolistic-type powers. Comcast could begin to dictate terms to the big Internet content companies, possibly undermining the goal of net neutrality. It could have a lot of strength in future negotiations.Brian Roberts outfoxed John Malone. The big surprise was that Malone lost out on this deal. The expectation was that Charter Communications would get it done, having agreed with Comcast on effectively leaving Comcast out of the big play. In the end, Comcast wasn’t satisfied, realized it didn’t need to cooperate with Charter, and went ahead on its own to do the deal. It’s possible Charter could still get in the action by purchasing assets that the combined company could sell.This is better for TWC shareholders. They would prefer to have Comcast stock, which is stable and strong, rather than Charter’s highly leveraged and highly volatile stock. The deal came at an enormous premium to TWC’s stock price, but at an 8.3x multiple of TWC’s forward earnings, it’s actually in line with the 8.35x multiple at which the industry currently trades.Comcast gets East Coast dominance. A huge spot missing in the Comcast footprint was the New York metro area. That was Time Warner Cable turf. With this deal, Comcast now has a strong hold in the Northeast, ranging from Philadelphia all the way through New England.There is no breakup fee. If the regulators find a way to stop this from happening, Comcast can walk away with its cash intact. The Federal Communications Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Justice Department could all play a role in deciding if the combined company will have too much market share. They will also decide whether Comcast needs to divest any assets before they agree to the deal. Comcast is ready to divest 3 million subscribers, which would reduce its national market share to 30 percent—a level that should avoid antitrust issues.'),\n",

       "  '2013-11-12',\n",
       "  'With big plans for China, the Walt Disney Co. can’t afford a long fight over the now-infamous segment on Disney-owned ABC last month in which a little blond-haired boy told Jimmy Kimmel that the U.S. should fix its financial problems by killing all the people in China. Gee, don’t kids say the darndest things? The comedian didn’t help matters by following up the tot’s comment by asking the other children on the panel, “Should we allow the Chinese to live?” Chinese-Americans are understandably upset and have demanded apologies from Kimmel and ABC.Now the Chinese government is getting in on the umbrage action, with a spokesman yesterday calling on the network to “respond to the Chinese community’s demand in a sincere way,” the official Xinhua news agency reported. According to Xinhua, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang added that “spreading racism and hatred goes against the media’s social responsibility.”In a worrisome sign for Disney, the call for an apology came after ABC had indeed apologized. “Please accept our heartfelt, sincere apology,” the network said in a Nov. 8 statement. Perhaps the Chinese Foreign Ministry doubts the sincerity of the apology, with the sort of mistakes-were-made passive construction your English teacher warned you never to use. “The simple fact is, the segment should never have been broadcast,” ABC said, adding: “steps have been made to try and prevent this kind of egregious mistake from occurring in the future.”The Chinese media are certainly skeptical. “An apology letter purportedly written by Kimmel was posted on one of Xinhua’s official Sina Weibo accounts on Monday,” the Global Times reported. (Emphasis added.) “In the letter, written in Chinese, Kimmel said that he felt sorry and ‘it was not his intention to offend anyone.’ “If anti-ABC protests in the U.S. turn into anti-Disney protests in China, the bad publicity could spoil the company’s plans to win over Chinese consumers in time for the opening of its newest theme park, now under construction in Shanghai. Scheduled to open in 2015, the resort will have two hotels, as well as Shanghai Disneyland. The park will “blend classic Disney storytelling and characters with all-new attractions and experiences tailored specifically for the people of China,” Disney promises on its website.As part of the runup to the Shanghai park opening, Disney is also planning the world’s biggest Disney Store, a 53,000-square-foot complex in Pudong that will include a 10,800-square-foot store, plus an outdoor plaza. The company is targeting Chinese families through its Disney English-language centers, and it is supporting Chinese entrepreneurs through its venture capital arm, Steamboat Ventures. The VC fund has invested in more than a dozen Chinese startups and last month joined with four additional funds to put $50 million into Beijing-based mobile game developer Chukong Technologies.Fortunately for Disney, the company has a valuable ally in China. State-owned Shanghai Shendi Group is Disney’s partner in the $4.4 billion Shanghai project. That should help Disney control the damage to its image among Chinese consumers.'),\n",
       " ('The False Promise of Classroom Technology',\n",
       "  '2013-11-11',\n",
       "  'The cover story of Life magazine on Oct. 16 was “U.S. Schools: They Face a Crisis.” Of course, there’s pretty much always a sense of crisis in education—in fact, the Life story dates from 63 years ago: Oct. 16, 1950—and it isn’t limited to the U.S. Two weeks ago, the U.K. announced it would revamp its curriculum and testing for 16-year-olds yet again, on the basis (yet again) that the previous system wasn’t rigorous enough.Both the American and British school systems could surely do better. The trouble is that the perpetual sense of educational crisis leads to a search for quick fixes—the latest of which is throwing Information Technology at the classroom. That “solution” has a bad record in the West and, if anything, a worse record in the rest of the world—including in countries where schools are truly failing. Computer labs are still no substitute for teachers with the flexibility and incentive to teach backed up by parents with a commitment that their kids learn.For all the complaints Americans have about their schools, other countries have far more reason to worry than we do. In the U.S., education assessments actually show slow but continuing progress in learning outcomes. By contrast, in India, only about one in four kids completing primary school has mastered the four tasks of reading a simple passage, performing division, telling time, and handling money. The huge gap between the number of kids completing primary school and the number who have mastered even a fraction of the syllabus is sparking discussions of a genuine “crisis of learning” across the developing world.One common response has been to put more computers in schools. In 1996, Al Gore promised to give every child in America access to high-quality educational technology by the dawn of the new century. The United Nations’ Broadband Commission extols (pdf) high-speed Internet as a tool “to deliver education in developing and developed countries alike.” Encouraged by such visionaries as Stanford computer scientist Peter Norvig and tech companies such as Apple, global leaders have waxed nerdily over the potential for information technology to transform learning.As any parent knows, kids love computers. Years ago, Indian researcher Sugata Mitra put a computer in the wall of a slum in Delhi and just left it there. Within weeks, children were accessing the Disney website. A group founded by MIT’s Nicholas Negroponte updated the trick by dropping off 20 tablet computers in an Ethiopian village last year—without an instructor or instruction books. Sure enough, kids started playing with them, some even learning to read a few words of English as a result.It’s great when that natural curiosity can be used to help educate children. Khan Academy has put thousands of lessons in subjects from biology to art history online—it’s surely helping a lot of kids with their homework. Pratham, an Indian NGO, tested a computer program that combined math questions with a knockoff version of the Asteroids arcade game and found that when children used it for two hours a week, it had a considerable impact on math test scores.Sadly, however, the wider educational impact of wiring up schools and homes and giving computers to kids has been disappointing. The University of Chicago’s Austan Goolsbee studied the impact of subsidized Internet rollout in California’s school system in the late 1990s: The program worked to extend Internet access, but there was no impact on learning outcomes. As broadband rolled out across North Carolina, Urban Institute researchers found (pdf) “modest but statistically significant and persistent negative impacts on student math and reading test scores.” On the other side of the Atlantic, Carnegie Mellon’s Rodrigo Bello and colleagues looked at schools in Portugal and found significant declines in ninth-grade national exam scores as broadband use increased; meanwhile, “students in schools that block access to websites such as YouTube perform relatively better.” And looking at results from across the countries that take part in the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA), test scores are lower pdf) among students who use computers intensively.In the developing world, analysis of the One Laptop per Child program, which hands out specially designed computers loaded with learning applications, has shown similar and consistently disappointing results. In Peru, a program that randomly assigned the computers found that kids who got them certainly used them—and did a little better on IQ tests—but researchers at the Inter-American Development Bank found no impact at all on math or language scores. Another evaluation (pdf) of the program in Nepal suggested computer-assisted learning had “no impact or a negative impact on student learning, non-cognitive skills and attendance.” Or look at the results of a laptop-distribution program in schools in Costa Rica: Give kids a laptop, and they’ll do considerably worse on their math tests.That’s not to say we should ban computers from the classroom altogether. Beyond their considerable entertainment and social value, computers can be a real tool for learning—and computing is a valuable skill in its own right. But integrating computers in the schoolroom is hard work and is likely to succeed only when the basics are already there. When teachers are well-trained and motivated, and when computer use is embedded in well-designed lesson plans, and when access to Disney and YouTube (and Facebook, and Twitter, and World of Warcraft …) is disabled, information technology can be a useful adjunct to teaching. But it’s no silver bullet, and it certainly can’t make up for a broken school system. Systemic education reform is messy, arduous work—and it can’t be done with an iPad, either.'),\n",

       "  'Finally, we can put a price of a sort on leaking state secrets: $1.7 million. That was the breathtakingly dismal box-office tally this past weekend for The Fifth Estate, a biopic of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. Fittingly, that’s also the amount a different group of filmmakers tried—and failed—to raise on Kickstarter to make a feature film on National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden. Jason Bourque and Travis Doering, his aspiring chroniclers, have now moved their fundraising pitch to a new website in the hope they’ll make enough to start filming Classified: The Edward Snowden Story in early 2014.Sure, one might ask, who wants to pull out the popcorn to watch some midlevel hero hit the send button to gush government secrets before dashing off? Perhaps the folks at DreamWorks and Disney, who may need it to balance the stiff drinks they downed after watching the WikiLeaks film flop. It’s as if DreamWorks, which has inspired audiences with heroes from Shrek to Lincoln, somehow misplaced the rule book for this one. Earnest activists have been more palatable when played by Hollywood stars like Julia Roberts (Erin Brockovich), Matt Damon (The Informant!), Sally Field (Norma Rae), or Russell Crowe (The Insider). If they’re not especially likable, they should be doing heroic things. It also helps to have more dramatic action than clicking on a keyboard (a challenge in movies like The Social Network, too).That doesn’t mean a Snowden biopic can’t be a blockbuster if it ever gets made. At least the tale of NSA leaks holds the promise of a cameo by Vladimir Putin and the drama of having Donald Trump ban him from the Miss Universe Competition via Twitter. I know 18 backers on Kickstarter are eager to see what comes of this. The bigger challenge for the filmmakers is the reality that most of us aren’t that curious about Snowden’s life. After two months of saturation coverage, two more hours doesn’t sound like a lot of fun. Even those who consider him a hero for uncovering government surveillance would probably admit they’ve had their fill on the back story and are more curious about what happens from here.That’s not to say Americans lack the patience to watch serious subjects on screen. Getting them to watch a dramatic portrayal of overexposed hackers, though, requires digging deep into Hollywood’s tool kit to make it entertaining.'),\n",

       "  '2013-10-11',\n",
       "  'Count on James B. Stewart to come up with the gay and mob subplots to last year’s collapse of the corporate law firm, Dewey & LeBoeuf.The prolific New York Times business columnist and author of such books as The Partners, Den of Thieves, and DisneyWar, Stewart investigates tirelessly and then crafts gripping narratives. His latest dispatch for the New Yorker includes fresh angles on the well-chronicled demise of Dewey & LeBoeuf, a mega-firm whose expiration epitomizes an era of instability in Big Law. Three highlights:1. Gays: Stewart paints vivid portraits of Steven Davis, the former chairman of Dewey & LeBoeuf, and Stephen DiCarmine, the firm’s executive director. “The two Steves,” as they were known, displayed questionable judgment as managers and helped lead Dewey & LeBoeuf off the cliff. They also both happen to be homosexual, although they weren’t romantically involved. Stewart shows how perceived hostility toward gays within the firm exacerbated an already-toxic atmosphere. The journalist even suggests that Davis’s biggest mistake—seeking to merge his prior firm, LeBoeuf, Lamb, Greene & MacRae, with the financially troubled Dewey Ballantine—was driven in part by his anxiety over the potential defection of a pugnacious LeBoeuf rival he accused of homophobia.2. Crime, organized and otherwise: DiCarmine, whom Stewart describes as Davis’s e-mail-snooping hatchet man at Dewey & LeBoeuf, has a colorful family back story. DiCarmine’s cousin, with whom he was close as a child, turns out to be Vincent (Vinny Gorgeous) Basciano, a senior figure in the Bonanno crime family who has been convicted of murder and other crimes, Stewart reports. In 2011, as the law firm melodrama unfolded, Basciano faced a death-penalty hearing. DiCarmine took the stand to declare, “My cousin Vinny is loved by his family.” The jury sentenced Basciano to life in prison. Now out of the law game, DiCarmine is pursuing a degree at Parsons. Stewart writes that DiCarmine himself is “possibly the subject of a criminal investigation” related to allegations of fraud at Dewey & LeBoeuf.3. Bad advice: One of my favorite details in the New Yorker piece is that Davis brought in the McKinsey management consulting firm to advise on the ill-fated marriage that produced Dewey & LeBoeuf. McKinsey did what management consultants tend to do: give the client the advice the client wants to hear. In this case, the advice turned out to be exactly wrong. According to Stewart, McKinsey encouraged Davis to bribe reluctant rainmakers to remain at the merged firm by giving them lucrative guaranteed contracts that sowed jealousy and heightened acrimony. Amazingly, the management consultants come off looking almost as bad as the clueless lawyers.'),\n",

These “retransmission fees” are expected to top $3 billion this year. Networks insist they’re essential to their revenue growth; cable companies complain they’re too high and that the cable companies have little power to stop them from getting higher. “The rules are woefully out of date, are the primary reason cable bills are rising, and too frequently leave our customers without the programming they love,” Time Warner Cable Chief Executive Glenn Britt said in a statement after the CBS dispute ended.Broadcasters say Congress has no compelling reason to get involved in private commercial transactions. “We do not think it is an accident that nearly 90 percent of the disruptions in recent years were caused by Dish, Time Warner Cable, and DirecTV,” says Gerry Waldron, an attorney at Covington & Burling in Washington, who represents the National Association of Broadcasters and several individual broadcasters. “We think this is is a manufactured crisis. The vast majority of the time, the deals get done.”Four proposals are floating about the House and Senate that could serve as a vehicle for such action if Congress does decide to wade in:The Satellite Television Extension and Localism ActThis law, known as STELA, dates to 2004 and gives satellite companies a license to provide local TV stations, just as cable operators do. The current law is set to expire at the end of 2014, with most observers calling its reauthorization a near certainty. The debate is mainly over how “clean” the STELA reauthorization bill will be as it emerges from the legislative process, with the pay TV companies urging lawmakers to address the issue of retransmission disputes. Broadcasters are working for a “clean” bill, written narrowly to address the satellite companies’ immediate needs. “There’s nothing clean about the current retransmission system,” says Brian Frederick, a spokesman for the American Television Alliance, a coalition of pay-TV companies. Two House committees held hearings on the law this week. A final bill and vote are expected next year.Video CHOICE (Consumers Have Options in Choosing Entertainment)Representative Anna Eshoo, a Democrat who represents much of Silicon Valley, introduced this bill Sept. 9 aimed at ending blackouts. “Recurring TV blackouts, including the 91 U.S. markets impacted in 2012, have made it abundantly clear that the FCC needs explicit statutory authority to intervene when retransmission disputes break down,” Eshoo said in a press release. (The FCC gets involved now only if one party accuses the other of negotiating in bad faith.) The bill would unbundle broadcast stations from a cable package and prohibit a broadcaster from requiring a pay TV operator to take affiliated cable channels to obtain more popular channels. That issue is at the heart of why Cablevision sued Viacom in February, following a contentious negotiation.Eshoo’s bill would also require the FCC to study programming costs for sports networks in the top 20 regional sports markets. The rising fees for sports programming—led by ESPN—is considered one of the major influences behind rising cable bills and the power that content creators such as Disney hold in negotiations. Cable companies have praised Eshoo’s bill, while broadcasters are not fans. Don’t expect to see it get far in a Republican-led House.Television Consumer Freedom Act of 2013This bill, introduced in May by Senator John McCain (R-Ariz.), would end the long era of the cable television bundle, that phenomenon by which you pay for hundreds of channels and find yourself watching only about two dozen, or fewer. This summer, Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal signed on as a Democratic co-sponsor, but there’s been no similar sponsors on the House side. Blumenthal explained his support of the bill in an August interview with the Hollywood Reporter:“What I hear from cable consumers overwhelmingly is, ‘give us freedom of choice. Don’t make us pay for something we don’t want and won’t watch. Why am I paying for—you name a channel you don’t like or five or ten or them—just so I can watch the one I do want.’ That’s overwhelmingly the sentiment of people who buy this product. So this bill just gives voice and force to that sentiment.”But while millions of cable TV subscribers may hate the bundle, that system has been very lucrative for decades. And while pundits have predicted the rise of “à la carte” TV pricing at various times, over many years, that model has never gained traction or been devised in a way that all the important parties would sign on. Sure, the Internet may change the whole pay TV universe—but then again, the bundle’s death has been called, wrongly, so many times that it’s become a virtual zombie.Next Generation Television Marketplace ActThis bill from Representative Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, and former South Carolina Senator Jim DeMint, also a Republican, dates to December 2011 and would deregulate the entire television market, top to bottom. It would repeal compulsory copyright licenses, the legal mechanism by which content owners are required to let pay TV companies carry their programs, if they are paid a fee for the content. The bill, which would also dismantle the system of retransmission fees, is essentially an exercise in carrying free-market ideology to its logical conclusion. The problem? It would require a countless number of individual deal negotiations—any radio or television station that wanted to carry programming (i.e., all of them)—would need to strike deals with every programmer, yielding an inefficient system that would likely prove unworkable. Lawyers would love the bill, but don’t expect it ever to pass Congress.'),\n",
       " (\"Steve Case's Second Life as D.C.'s Favorite Businessman\",\n",
       "  '2013-08-22',\n",
       "  'It helps that he’s an hour late and his audience has spent the time getting into a keg of Shiner Bock, but when Steve Case walks into the Austin (Tex.) offices of the startup he’s just invested $40 million in, he gets a deafening welcome. More than 100 employees of Bigcommerce, a four-year-old company, are on their feet or perched on swings in its huge game room, with plate-glass views out over Hill Country. Case, overdressed from a meeting earlier in the day at the U.S. Capitol, is in a button-down shirt, pleated slacks, and tasseled loafers, looking a generation older than the scruffy dot-com workers he’s about to address. All he gets out is “Hey!” and then they’re chanting: “Steve! Steve! Steve! Steve! Steve!”For any startup, a new round of funding is an ecstatic occasion. Getting the money from Case—billionaire co-founder of America Online, father of the consumer Internet—brings a sense of destiny: Maybe this company will become legendary, too. “Our vision statement is, we invest in people and ideas that can change the world,” Case, 55, tells the staff once they’ve quieted down.A Bigcommerce executive steps up to speak next. “When you think about what Steve has done in the last few decades, it’s incredible,” he says. “I think back to AOL, we all had those CDs—” He’s cut off by laughter. Case is behind him, a huge grin on his pumpkin-shaped head, both fists thrust into the air at the memory of the promotional discs that overflowed from America’s mailboxes in the 1990s. A few minutes later, Case is working the room, regaling a cluster of star-struck staffers about the time AOL packed its free CDs into orders of frozen Omaha Steaks.A decade ago, the notion that Case would be celebrated by businesspeople of any description might have seemed laughable. At the peak of the Internet bubble, he engineered a merger with Time Warner that, while highly profitable for Case and other AOL insiders, quickly became known as the most disastrous in corporate history, with more than $200 billion in shareholder value destroyed. Business school students still learn about it as a case study in hubris and magical thinking. Yet it’s now clear that Case not only survived a debacle that would have ruined the careers of other executives—and did—but is also thriving again, in a self-made role that in some ways makes him more influential than ever.Case has a venture capital fund, Revolution, that aims to be the dominant VC firm east of the Mississippi. He launched it with some $500 million of his personal fortune in 2005, investing in companies such as Zipcar and LivingSocial; a $450 million fund with outside money followed in 2011, and a $150 million fund will go live this fall. He’s also an in-demand “cheerleader for entrepreneurism,” a gig that involves speaking at tech conferences, writing op-eds, and tweeting to 609,000 followers about #startups and #innovation. And perhaps most surprisingly for a figure who was once so radioactive, Case has become a genuinely productive figure in Washington—one of the few bipartisans who can take a meeting with the Obama White House one day and congressional Republicans the next, with actual legislation to his credit.How Case pulled this off—how he went from corporate punching bag to tech industry role model and Washington wise man—is partly about America’s endless capacity to forgive entrepreneurs. It’s partly a reminder that billionaires write their own rules. But mostly it’s about Case’s refusal to internalize much, if any, fault for what went wrong.“Given his psychological makeup, I’m not sure it really got into him that things didn’t go well, and that there’s some personal responsibility,” says Jerry Levin, Case’s counterpart at Time Warner, who fled the corporate world to start a New Age healing center in Santa Monica, Calif., and now lives in Maine. “That’s not a negative comment. It’s just that some people can kind of handle it, in a way that’s a Teflon thing. But I don’t know. I haven’t sat in on a therapy session with Steve.”\\n \\n \\nIn 1983, Case was a 24-year-old marketer for Pizza Hut when his older brother, an investment banker, helped him get a job at a small company that was trying to make video games interactive. That venture failed, but another one sprouted up. Case survived lean years, advanced, and by 1993 was chief executive officer of a company with a mission to help ordinary people discover how to e-mail, chat, and surf a simplified version of the Internet. It had a name that spelled out its ambitions: America Online.Case persuaded PC manufacturers to install modems in their products, wrote copy for dial-in screens, and fended off Microsoft’s rival offering. By the time You’ve Got Mail appeared in multiplexes in 1998, AOL was one of the most recognizable brands in consumer technology, with a subscriber count approaching 20 million. With search, buddy lists, instant messaging, and status updates, AOL was the equivalent of Google, Facebook, and Twitter all in one.Its exponential growth hid problems. As faster broadband connections became available in more markets, AOL stood to lose both dial-up revenue and the proceeds from its “walled garden” of content, once that programming no longer had a captive audience. And there was the gnawing question of whether its ads and other offerings were worth anything at all.Nevertheless, AOL’s market value increased 100,000 percent in eight years. Case, sitting on a market capitalization of $172 billion, could have bought virtually any company he wanted. In Time Warner he saw a gilded old-media empire—it owned movie studios, HBO, record labels, and magazines—whose CEO, Levin, was starting to feel threatened by the Internet. Case began to feel him out about an ostensible merger of equals: AOL had twice the valuation of Time Warner, even though the latter had two and a half times the profits. Case had the future on his side. He persuaded Levin to agree that AOL shareholders would get 55 percent of a merged entity.On Jan. 10, 2000, the largest merger in U.S. history was announced at a press conference in Manhattan. Case was ebullient, hugging and high-fiving Levin, as Time Warner board member Ted Turner compared his own excitement to the first time he’d had sex. To some Web true believers, the deal seemed to be a synergistic fusion of classy content brands and a digital juggernaut. Microsoft and Disney fought to block it. Skeptics warned all that had been married were Time Warner’s old-media problems and AOL’s vastly overpriced stock, and the market agreed. The companies’ shares slid 23 percent and 35 percent, respectively, from the day of the announcement to when the deal closed a year later, and the broad selloff after Sept. 11, 2001, made the situation worse. All the things that could go wrong with a merger did: The two corporate cultures grated, rival divisions undermined each other, and executives sniped at board meetings, as it became clear that the businesses were not compatible and never would be. AOL added an accounting scandal for good measure. Thousands of jobs were cut, and employee retirement accounts with company stock were annihilated. Turner later estimated he lost $8 billion.Case resigned in January 2003. “I still feel pretty good about my first chapter, even though I know not everybody does,” he says today. He maintains that had he stepped away the day he announced the merger, “people would have said it’s an awesome success and a brilliant trade.” He’d essentially swapped an overvalued AOL for more than half of a diversified media conglomerate. Time Warner shareholders, and investors who bought after the deal was announced, go unmentioned in this reckoning.Case did stay on, of course, but says that as chairman of the board he had little control over the running of the new business. “The execution of that merger was obviously not good,” he says. “I accept some responsibility for it, because I kind of put it in motion and for a couple years I was chairman of the board. But I think most people around the scene at the time would say, even today, that it would have been maybe a different case if I had been CEO and actually able to run it, vs. being up in the skybox.” When he quit as chairman, AOL Time Warner announced an annual loss of $99 billion, a record. Case was eventually able to cash in stock options worth hundreds of millions of dollars.Jonathan Knee, a senior managing director at Evercore Partners, includes the deal on the syllabus of the course he teaches at Columbia Business School. “You can’t teach mergers and acquisitions, or the cautionary aspect of M&A, without teaching this transaction,” he says. And yet Case happens to be right about it working out fabulously for his original investors. “From a Steve Case point of view, the shareholders of AOL should build a statue to the guy, and the shareholders of Time Warner should light torches and chase him down the street,” Knee says. “There’s a phrase I use—Steve Case found in Jerry Levin the perfect mark for the con of the century.”\\n \\n \\nCase calls the years after he left AOL Time Warner his “getting back in the garage phase.” He spent zero time wallowing in doubt—within days of leaving, he was planning what would become Revolution, which today has investments in 33 companies and occupies two floors of a building in northwest Washington, D.C. The location meant that when the Obama White House came calling, he was just up the street.Emerging from the 2009 recession, when politicians of both parties sought to associate themselves with job creation, it made sense to reach back to the roaring ’90s—AOL’s heyday. Case eagerly accepted the casting, agreeing in 2010 to co-chair a U.S. Department of Commerce committee on innovation and entrepreneurship. Panels like this often have token figureheads, but Case impressed the capital’s wonks with his tolerance for process and unshowy deference to lawmakers. Slightly Republican in his own politics, Case has been careful to donate the exact same amount of money to candidates of both parties, and he says he counts his tweets to make sure he’s not favoring one side.In 2011 the White House asked him to chair the Startup America Partnership, a public-private body that aims to turn places such as Des Moines and Nashville into entrepreneurial hubs. Case started meeting with Obama administration officials and lawmakers more frequently. In 2012 he played a key behind-the-scenes role in locking up votes for the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, known as the JOBS Act, a bill few pundits gave a chance of passing in an election year. Case was rewarded with a spot in the White House Rose Garden, over President Obama’s shoulder, as the bill was signed into law.“He’s really become a very serious and effective advocate,” says Gene Sperling, director of the National Economic Council. “He is not a flash in the pan. He is focused. He is substantive. And he stays at it. There are not that many people who are willing to make a real ongoing commitment of their personal capital to learning the ins and outs of our sometimes crazy world.”In Case’s political work, there are shades of how he built AOL—not with blazing charisma, but through extreme persistence, taking every meeting and being content with the good instead of the perfect.The simplest reason for politicians’ embrace of Case may be that he does not hold them in contempt, the way much of Silicon Valley seems to do. In caricature, tech leaders are libertarians who like to “move fast and break things,” as Facebook’s credo goes, and who look down on people in Washington as their constipated opposites. “They have a total disdain,” says Mark Warner, the Democratic senator from Virginia. “It’s always good to have a healthy disdain for politics. But there’s almost this naive arrogance to it, in the sense that they don’t really want to know how hard it is to get from A to Z.” Because AOL was based in the D.C. suburb of Dulles, Va., Case has been absorbing the capital’s rhythms for 30 years. “Steve has seen that some of this stuff takes time,” Warner says. “He’s got a patience that’s rare in the technology community.”“I share their frustration,” Case says about Silicon Valley types, “but we don’t live in a monarchy. The president has more limited power than people realize.”Case’s new cause is immigration reform, which passed the Senate in June and is inching its way through the House. It’s not glamorous work. One afternoon in July, Case is pulling on a coat and tie in Revolution’s elevator, en route to the Capitol for yet another meeting, this time with Kevin McCarthy, the House majority whip. He’s asked what he hopes to accomplish. “Build bipartisan support to pass comprehensive immigration reform so our nation can win the global battle for talent and we can remain the most innovative, entrepreneurial nation in the world,” he says through gritted teeth, a sign that the man who envisioned an Internet connection in every home is still adjusting to the incrementalism of politics.While he’s waiting in McCarthy’s office, Case pulls up the whip’s Wikipedia page to see if he’s remembering correctly that the California congressman used to own a deli. “I’m here to get the franchise rights to Kevin’s Hoagies,” Case says in greeting when McCarthy comes out, and the congressman laughs. In the meeting, Case promises to speak to the Republican caucus about how to frame immigration as an economic issue.Case’s spadework has already paid off—reputationally, he is by some measures back at the level he left off in the late ’90s. He flew to a jobs forum in Cleveland with President Obama on Air Force One, deplaning just after the commander in chief. He sat directly behind Michelle Obama at the president’s speech about jobs to a joint session of Congress in September 2011, in front of American Express CEO Kenneth Chenault and General Electric boss Jeffrey Immelt.“Take a step back,” says Ron Klain, Revolution’s general counsel and a former chief of staff to Vice President Joe Biden. “We’re at a time when there is a tremendous amount of interest in celebrating entrepreneurs. Big Business has lost some of its shine in Washington, and certainly the financial sector. And talk to anyone in college now—they all have their own startup idea. It’s a big concept in the culture. Steve is at the forefront of that.”A grateful VC industry is on the receiving end of Case’s efforts. The JOBS Act contained multiple sweetheart provisions for technology companies: Startups are now allowed to have more private investors before going public, and they will soon be able to raise money through crowdfunding, which critics call a recipe for fraud. When they do file for an initial public offering, they can keep more financial information secret, including some measures of executive compensation. All of this helps increase the odds of big payouts to venture capitalists.Case also has interests in the immigration reform bill now being considered by the House. He is a long-term investor in the hospitality industry, which relies heavily on guest workers. And tech companies have long complained about visa rules that keep them from hiring the best foreign talent.Case’s wife, Jean, has experience in the political realm, too: She was appointed chair of a public service council by President George W. Bush in 2006 and co-chair of a U.S.-Palestinian business initiative the following year. She’s head of the Case Foundation, the couple’s philanthropic organization, which they moved from Virginia to Washington in 2003 to be closer to the center of the action. When Facebook’s Sheryl Sandberg and venture capitalist John Doerr joined Case on the 2011 jobs council, he joked with them about the hassles they faced making it to meetings from California. “For them to come to D.C., it’s two days,” Case says. “For me, it’s two minutes.” He lives across the Virginia border, in a house overlooking the Potomac River that was the childhood home of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. “Having our center of gravity in D.C. has worked out well. It’s actually helpful. I kind of have home court advantage.”\\n \\n \\n“I do get asked that question a lot: Why are you doing this?” Case says, sitting in his office on Rhode Island Avenue. “The implicit assumption is: If I was you, I wouldn’t be doing this.” His voice gets a little quieter. “So why are you doing this?”Presiding over policy roundtables, prowling the corridors of Capitol Hill—this isn’t penance for the Time Warner-AOL merger, he says. After all, he doesn’t think he did anything wrong. “I still think it was the right thing to do.”To old Time Warner shareholders, or anyone with a rudimentary sense of shame, that impenitence may be frustrating. It might be more satisfying if Case were in exile with Levin on the shores of Maine, brooding on how it all went wrong. But the economy is better off with Case’s millions recirculating into new startups, and with his odd political currency helping the deadlocked Congress to act. One of America’s enduring strengths is its willingness to grant second chances, and Case’s comeback suggests that short of criminal fraud, there may be no corporate failure too epic to walk back from. It took him a decade, but now Steve Case is off probation.Ted Leonsis, a longtime lieutenant at AOL, may know Case better than anyone besides his wife. He resigned from the company in 2006, then reunited with Case on a venture, Revolution Money, that they eventually sold to American Express. Now he helps run Revolution’s $450 million growth fund. When Leonsis first went to work for Case in 1994, they took a Myers-Briggs personality test together. Case scored an INTP: introverted, intuiting, thinking, perceiving. Case retook the exam recently, Leonsis says, and this time came up as a light extrovert.“He’s mellowed,” Leonsis says, “in that he’s so smart and so quick, and his level of empathy for realizing that not everybody is as smart and as fast and as quick as him, his tolerance of that has dramatically enhanced, which I think has made him more a man of the people.”Case and Levin keep in sporadic touch. I told Levin about Case walking into the Bigcommerce offices in Austin with an entourage of one and asked him if he thought Case missed the corporate world they were once at the pinnacle of. “It may not be the material trappings he misses,” Levin says. He recalled a day in the ’90s when then-Treasury Secretary Larry Summers convened a panel of CEOs, and Case was fawned over as the most dynamic. “This is just an armchair analysis, but I think that is what he misses. He has the money. The money isn’t important; it’s just a symbol.” Acceptance in the circles of power is “psychologically what he misses, and why he’s trying to carve it out now.”In announcing the Bigcommerce investment that brought Case to Austin, a Revolution press release described him as “Steve Case, the iconic entrepreneur.” Does he deserve that appellation, given how disastrous the AOL-Time Warner marriage turned out to be? (AOL was spun back off in 2009 and is still searching for an identity. It continues to get all of its profits from dial-up fees.)“I’m laughing because we all want to rewrite our own history,” Levin says. “What does he want to be known for? As the kind of initiating entrepreneur for the Internet? Well, AOL has been succeeded by lots of things now. So what does he want? Inside his mind and his memory bank, what’s his legacy? The combination of a political agenda, particularly when the nation needs it, and being associated with entrepreneurship and jobs and innovation—that’s probably a preferable legacy from his point of view.”Legacy or no, Case sees a huge opportunity at the junction of his two passions, entrepreneurship and policy. He recognized, when few others did, that the Internet would become part of everyday American life, remaking everything from personal finance to advertising. Now Case argues that the last few industries on the brink of being revolutionized by the Internet—health care, education, transportation—happen to be ones in which the government plays a gigantic role in purchasing and rulemaking.The first investment by Revolution’s venture fund, in January 2012, went to Fedbid, a company that brings online auctions to the federal procurement process. A few months later, Case invested in Echo360, a company that digitizes lectures and aims to reach half of all U.S. college students by 2017. This summer, Revolution filed to raise a $150 million fund that will focus on early-stage startups.The bulk of Revolution’s portfolio companies are based in and around Washington, where Case plays a VIP role in the local startup scene. A few blocks from Revolution’s building is an incubator called 1776, where 145 dot-coms share work space. On a recent afternoon, 10 entrepreneurial hopefuls file into a flag-decorated conference room to practice their 60-second pitch and to ask Case about starting a company.“I should start with an apology,” says one. “I used to pirate so much software off AOL.” Case tells him that Mark Zuckerberg confessed the same thing when they first met a handful of years ago.The group peppers Case with questions about hiring, contracting, seed capital, and growth, growth, growth. Later, on his Gulfstream IV, I ask him if the younger generation ever asks him about the part that came after AOL’s rise—the long shadow that Case has only now managed to escape.“It comes up occasionally,” he says, his sock feet propped up on the seat opposite him. “But it’s actually—I think most of them would say, ‘Boy, I’d love to have that problem.’\\u2009”'),\n",

       "  '“Capitalism in Question” sounds like a consciousness-raising session from Occupy Wall Street. But it also happens to be the theme of this year’s annual meeting of the Academy of Management, an association of management professors with more than 19,000 members in over 100 countries. It’s happening on Aug. 9-13 at Walt Disney World in Florida.Readers are left to draw their own conclusions about whether the questioning of capitalism is a sign that management professors have been infected by the liberalism of their colleagues from the philosophy and sociology departments, or whether capitalism has performed so poorly lately that even the people who teach it for a living are asking hard questions.Whatever the case, the call for submissions of papers is provocative:“The recent economic and financial crises, austerity, and unemployment, and the emergence of many economic, social, and environmental protest movements around the world have put back on the agenda some big questions about this vision: What kind of economic system would this better world be built on? Would it be a capitalist one? If so, what kind of capitalism? If not, what are the alternatives?”Some of the session titles:• Making Space for Indigenous Worldviews: from Received Economic Hegemony to Diverse Ways of Knowing• Cross-National Capitalism in Question• Is Postcapitalist Organization and Management Possible? Some Answers to Matters of Concern• Capitalism in Question: Towards an Economics of Justice, Sustainability, and Economic Thrivability• Capitalism in Crisis and Other Conundrums: Tackling the Big QuestionsGar Alperovitz, a left-leaning professor of political economy at the University of Maryland, was invited to give a keynote address. In a blog post he said he was “a bit taken aback” but pleased by the invitation. He wrote that the conference’s request for submissions “outlines the kind of sophisticated research agenda we’ll need if we’re serious about building something over time beyond the traditional systemic capitalist model.”“Amazing how strong is the critique of capitalism they have produced for this event,” Alperovitz wrote in an e-mail.Paul Adler, who chose the theme of this year’s conference in his role as program chairman, is a professor of management and organization at the University of Southern California’s Marshall School of Business. He was educated in Australia and France and was previously affiliated with the Brookings Institution, Columbia University, Harvard Business School, and Stanford’s School of Engineering.Adler wrote in an e-mail that “my colleagues on the Executive Committee and Board have been very supportive.” He added: “Of course, we all have different ideas about what the term ‘capitalism’ refers to and what exactly is or should be in question about it. … But there is a real eagerness among my colleagues to consider these ‘broader’ issues and how they should be reflected in our research and teaching.”By the way, the 2014 conference should be less controversial. It’s tentative theme is “The Power of Words.”'),\n",

       "  'If you want to run a media business, you should study how savvy users are consuming media. To that end, Warner Bros. executive David Kaplan wants to look at the savviest of media consumers: the pirates.“Generally speaking, we view piracy as a proxy of consumer demand,” Kaplan, the head of anti-piracy efforts at Warner Bros. Entertainment, wrote in a piece posted on the website of this week’s Los Angeles-based Anti-Piracy & Content Protection Summit. “Accordingly, enforcement related efforts are balanced with looking at ways to adjust or develop business models to take advantage of that demand by offering fans what they are looking for when they are looking for it.”Kaplan says it makes sense to loosen up on copyright infringements that don’t pose legitimate threats to business, acknowledging that fans who make mash-ups of your material are like an extra ad department that works for free:“We give a wide berth to ‘fan use’ and permit fans to use and interact with our content in ways that might technically still constitute copyright infringement, but do not directly substitute for the full length feature, episode or game. Warner Bros. and Time Warner, for that matter are content creating companies. Indeed, we include major news outlets. Freedom of expression is key to our businesses, and any actions pursued on the enforcement side are taken with that in mind.”Many video-game companies have taken this approach to the insanely popular in-game replay videos that fans make and post to YouTube through channels such as Machinima. At the same time, Nintendo‘s recent decision to start claiming a portion of the ad revenue from these videos is a reminder that openness seems more threatening when money is on the table.Media companies may also be coming around to the idea that the models for moving pirated content are worth imitating. A 2010 study by researchers at the University of Texas, Dallas found that legal digital music marketplaces blunt demand for illegal ones; while the impact of music piracy continues to be disputed, legal online music services have since then gained steam.Hollywood studios have begun to question some of the basic tenets of their distribution model. According to the Wall Street Journal, Disney and Sony Pictures are letting Korean consumers stream movies at home, even while theaters are still showing them, in an attempt to reduce the incentive to pirate new releases.The idea has its opponents. Major U.S. movie theater chains require a period of exclusivity from studios, precisely because they’re concerned that many people would stay home if they could. This idea is probably not going to be coming to the United States any time soon.The streaming movies aren’t necessarily cheap, either. But there’s definitely a school of thought within media companies that customers would be willing to pay for the relative convenience and safety. And anything that might steer people away from BitTorrent is worth a shot.'),\n",

       "  'When I attended McGill University in Montreal, I had a friend from Chicago who loved to tell the story of his first visit back to his old high school, in a fairly rough neighborhood of the city.“Canada?” a classmate he bumped into said when he told him where he was studying. “Bring me back a musket!”I’ve never handled a musket, trapped a beaver, or chopped wood for a living (though I have for camping), but as a Canadian I have encountered my fair share of Americans embracing a sort of blissful ignorance about the reality of life north of the border. “Toronto, that’s near Vancouver, right?” a fortysomething entertainment executive who works in New York and lives in Connecticut asked me last year, only to be astounded to learn that no, Toronto is just a day’s drive north of her house. “Are there black people in Canada?” a Californian once inquired. A Floridian wondered whether the Mounties patrolled our cities on horseback, while a Bostonian once commented that it must be awful here in the summer, what with all the snow.While these are the most egregious examples, the fact is many Americans continue to have in mind a vision of Canada ripped straight from the 360-degree film version of the country broadcast at Disney’s Epcot Center. It’s rooted in the notion that this is a sensible nation of prim Anglo-Saxon values, shaped by prudent caution, sane governance, and bad mustaches, an idyllic paradise of moderate progressives that Subaru Democrats threaten to move to each time a Republican wins the White House.Which is why the news that Montreal’s mayor, Michael Applebaum, was arrested Monday morning on corruption charges was so surprising for Americans. Corruption in Canada? How is this possible? But Applebaum’s arrest is only the latest in a wide-ranging construction and bribe scandal in Quebec (he replaced the previous mayor, who resigned after allegations surfaced), involving shady, Mafia-connected construction companies in kickback schemes straight out of the The Sopranos. Meanwhile, here in Toronto, Mayor Rob Ford continues to dodge questions about an alleged (and still missing) video of him smoking crack cocaine, as well as an alleged association with street gangs.A few miles away, in the massive suburb of Mississauga, 92-year-old mayor Hazel McCallion, who has ruled for over three decades with uncontested power reminiscent of Singapore’s Lee Kuan Yew, was acquitted last week of a conflict of interest involving her son’s pursuit of a lucrative real estate deal. In London, a city midway between Toronto and Detroit, Mayor Joe Fontana, who faced charges in the past that he used public money to pay for his son’s wedding, is now under fire from income tax authorities for deriving lucrative “consulting” fees from a charity that was supposed to support after-school lunches and HIV/AIDS medication. Senators in Ottawa (actual senators, not the pro hockey players—as if most Americans would know or care that Ottawa is the capital of Canada, or that the city has an NHL team) have to pay back hundreds of thousands of dollars in fraudulent expenses, and the ruling government apparently has secret slush funds. Even Winnipeg’s mayor, Sam Katz, hasn’t escaped the fray, busted by a watchful mother last month after he spit his gum onto a public lawn.Just what the hell is going on up here? When did Canada turn into some maple-syrup version of Berlusconi’s Italy, without the bunga-bunga? Have we lost our moral compass?The reality is that Canada is finally shedding its antiquated image in the eyes of America. It took the glare of the global media focusing on Rob Ford for the world to realize that Toronto is as big, complicated, and messy a metropolis as any of its size in America. Montreal’s corruption is as endemic as that in New Orleans. We are more alike than you think, America.Which is a good thing. The less we’re thought of as the squeaky-clean, Ned Flanders neighbor to the north, the more people will realize that Canadians are as innovative, hungry, and prone to risk as America and other nations. Toronto’s property market is just as speculative as New York’s (if not more), Montreal has a tech startup scene, and our national wireless monopolies are as rapacious and anticompetitive as any below the 49th parallel. If it takes a bunch of corrupt, possibly criminal mayors to make America realize that, so be it.'),\n",
       " ('For Fighting Poverty, Cash Is Surprisingly Effective',\n",
       "  '2013-06-03',\n",
       "  'Worldwide, richer people express fears about handing money to poorer people. Giving poor people money is no way to stop them being poor, the thinking goes: Surely they will just waste it. Instead, we design complex, bureaucratic programs like SNAP, the supplemental nutrition assistance program (formerly known as food stamps), to help poor families buy food and only food. That way, they can’t buy a trip to Disney World with our tax dollars.A growing number of studies suggest that this is wrong-headed, that just handing over cash even to some of the world’s poorest people actually does have a considerable and long-lasting positive impact on their incomes, employment, health, and education. And that suggests we should update both our attitudes about poor people and our poverty reduction programs.In 2008, the Ugandan government handed out cash transfers worth $382, about a year’s income, to thousands of poor 16- to 35-year-olds. The money came with few strings—recipients only had to explain how they would use the money to start a trade. Columbia University’s Chris Blattman and his co-authors found that, four years after receiving the cash, recipients were two-thirds more likely to be practicing a trade than non-recipients, and their earnings were more than 40 percent higher. They were also about 40 percent more likely to be paying taxes.In a second study, Blattman and colleagues looked at a program that gave $150 cash grants to 1,800 of the very poorest women in northern Uganda. Most began some sort of retail operation to supplement their income, and within a year their monthly earnings had doubled and cash savings tripled. The impact was pretty much the same whether or not participants received mentoring; business training added some value, but handing over the money it cost to provide would have added more.Most cash-transfer programs do impose conditions—like requiring kids to go to school or get vaccinated, which does improve school attendance and vaccination rates considerably. But Blattman’s research suggests conditions aren’t necessary to improve the quality of life of poor families. In fact, while analysis by the World Bank’s Berk Ozler shows that making cash transfers conditional on kids being in school has a bigger impact than a no-strings-attached check, even “conditionless cash” considerably raises enrollment. Conditional programs increase the odds of a child being in school by 41 percent; unconditional programs, 23 percent. Other studies of cash transfers in developing countries have found a range of impacts that had little or nothing to do with any conditions applied: lower crime rates, improved child nutrition and child health, lower child mortality, improved odds of kids being in school, and declines in early marriage and teenage pregnancy.These studies all suggest that if you give poor people money they’ll use it to make themselves a little better off. That’s not necessarily a pathway to wealth—after all, microenterprises of the sort started by Blattman’s Ugandan entrepreneurs are usually a last resort for poor people, who would much rather have a steady job. And cash transfers may improve nutrition and school attendance, but they can’t make up for a dysfunctional state that can’t provide public infrastructure or decent services. But what they can provide is at least one or two rungs on the ladder out of poverty.This holds true outside of the developing world. Back in the 1970s, the U.S. federal government experimented with a “negative income tax” that guaranteed an income to thousands of randomly selected low-income recipients. (Think of today’s Earned Income Tax Credit, only without the requirement to earn income.) The results suggested that the transfers improved test scores and school attendance for the children of recipients, reduced prevalence of low-birth-weight kids, and increased homeownership. Early analysis of a 2007 cash transfer program in New York City suggested that transfers averaging $6,000 per family conditional on employment, preventative health care, and children’s educational attendance led to reduced poverty and hunger, improved school attendance and grade advancement, reduced health-care hardships, and increased savings.Findings from around the world suggest that giving cash over goods or in-kind transfers is cheaper and more cost-effective, too. Economist Jenny Aker has found that cash transfers are better used than food vouchers in a comparison in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Unsurprisingly, giving people a food voucher means they purchase more food than they do if you give them cash. But give them cash and they are able to save some of the money and pay school fees, all while consuming as diverse a diet as those who got vouchers. And the cash-transfer program is considerably less expensive to run.It is comfortable for richer people to think they are richer because of the moral failings of the poor. And that justifies a paternalistic approach to poverty relief using vouchers and in-kind support. But the big reason poor people are poor is because they don’t have enough money, and it shouldn’t come as a huge surprise that giving them money is a great way to reduce that problem—considerably more cost-effectively than paternalism. So let’s abandon the huge welfare bureaucracy and just give money to those we should help out.'),\n",
       " (\"John McCain Is Wrong: Unbundled Cable Won't Kill ESPN\",\n",
       "  '2013-05-23',\n",
       "  'When Senator John McCain (R-Ariz.) took his mission to unbundle cable TV before the Commerce Committee earlier this month, he named ESPN as one of the main beneficiaries of the current system. “What many of these Americans are beginning to realize is that included in their cable bill is a charge of about $10 per month to just carry sports programming like ESPN, which cost nearly $5 a month,” McCain told the committee. That same day on Bloomberg TV, McCain took a swing at ESPN President John Skipper. “My only question would be,” he said, “do you have any trouble shaving in the morning looking at yourself in the mirror?”Knocking ESPN, as McCain knows, is an American pastime almost on a par with watching it. When news came this week that Disney’s profit machine was cutting up to 400 jobs, the doomsayers began to pile on. Yesterday Business Insider speculated that increased competition and rising costs for sports programming could spell the beginning of the end for ESPN’s run of dominance. If ESPN starts getting outbid on prime properties, wrote Tony Manfred, “it will become one of many [midsize] players in the live sports business, and it won’t be able to charge cable providers $5 per subscriber like it does now.”Five bucks a month is a sexy, scandalous number, especially when you consider that ESPN reaches 98.5 million households. But there’s reason to believe that the network could easily be making more—and that the scourge of bundling might actually be holding it back.ESPN gets an average of $5.15 per subscriber now. That’s $507 million per month and $6 billion per year. To get there without McCain’s 74-year-old widow neighbor, ESPN would need to collect more from its actual viewers. According to Nielsen numbers provided by Brad Adgate of Horizon Media, 68.1 million households tuned into ESPN at some point in the fourth quarter of 2012. That’s nearly 70 percent of the homes that get the channel. If each of those viewers were willing to pay about $7.50 à la carte, ESPN could maintain status quo.It’s unlikely that every one of those 68.1 million would be ready to pay that price. Some, says Adgate, could have watched for just a few minutes. And October through December is a peak time for ESPN, with the NFL in season. Still, the network reached an average of 55.8 million households per month in that period, and 38.6 million per week. If every monthly viewer paid $9, or every weekly viewer paid $13, ESPN would hold steady. With Netflix streaming at $7.99 per month to 36 million subscribers, those numbers are not far-fetched. In any given minute, 986,000 households are watching ESPN.The real free-riders in the bundling system are the dozens and dozens of unwatched channels fetching 50¢ a month. A Credit Suisse report (pdf) last fall on the state of play in cable showed that the average household gets 137 channels but watches only 33 each month. (This breaks out, according to the report, to 57¢ per channel you get, or $1.89 per channel you watch.) In most homes, ESPN is on the good side of that ledger. This makes it is as well-positioned as anybody to steal loose change from the likes of Logo, Fuse, and GardenTV and come out ahead.'),\n",
       " (\"Companies' Plea for Tax Reform—for Everyone Else\",\n",
       "  '2013-05-09',\n",
       "  'As part of an effort to revamp the 4 million-word tax code, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp invited Americans to send suggestions to Congress. More than 300 companies and business groups chimed in this spring, many with the same message: An overhaul is a great idea—as long as it doesn’t affect us.Camp, a Michigan Republican, wants to lower the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 25 percent. To do that without reducing government revenue, Congress will have to get rid of many tax breaks. Companies are saying “they want the best of both worlds,” says Representative Kenny Marchant, a Texas Republican. “They want to keep all their deductions and have a lower rate.”Nissan North America wrote to say that it’s all for legislation that “significantly simplifies” the code—but to please leave Sections 30C and 30D alone. Those grant a $7,500 tax credit to consumer buyers of electric cars, such as Nissan’s struggling Leaf, and provide credits of up to $30,000 for companies that purchase car-charging equipment. “When you’re rolling out a new technology, there has to be some help,” says Tracy Woodard, Nissan’s director of government affairs. The credit for consumers will cost the Treasury $3.2 billion between 2013 and 2017, according to Congress’s Joint Committee on Taxation.Starbucks wants to preserve a regulation that lets it defer taxes on its coffee-trading operation in Lausanne, Switzerland. Most income generated from buying and selling goods overseas is subject to U.S. taxes of up to 35 percent. But there’s an exception for seven crops that aren’t widely grown stateside: cocoa, tea, bananas, black pepper, crude rubber, coconut, and coffee. Brian Ugai, a Starbucks vice president, wrote to Congress that fiddling with the provision would put the company at a “severe competitive disadvantage.” Starbucks’s operations in foreign countries shaved 3.3 percentage points off its 2012 tax rate, according to the company’s securities filings.Marathon Oil wants to continue deducting costs associated with drilling; scrapping that break would raise $11 billion for the Treasury over 10 years, according to President Obama’s budget. Capital One Financial and other regional banks don’t want Congress to touch the deduction for interest, which keeps people and companies borrowing. The PGA Tour is asking lawmakers to continue letting businesses deduct 100 percent of the ticket price for an event that donates all its proceeds to charity, such as a PGA golf tournament.Not all companies are seeking a break for their breaks—some are willing to give up subsidies for a lower overall rate. 3M and Walt Disney explicitly told Congress they’d be willing to forgo the 9 percent deduction on income generated from domestic manufacturing. Disney said it would also be fine without the break for producing a film in the U.S. And 3M said it could live without the research and development tax credit, because it comes with cumbersome rules and conditions.So far, Camp hasn’t said which breaks he’s targeting. Ways and Means member Jim McDermott, a Democrat from Washington, says lawmakers will take their time picking apart the merits of the companies’ “hyperbolic worries” because the code is so long and complex, and the implications of tinkering with it are enormous. “When you touch one place in a spider web,” McDermott says, “it all moves.”The bottom line: More than 300 companies and business groups have weighed in on Congress’s upcoming overhaul of the tax code.'),\n",
       " ('Mr. Dodd Goes to Hollywood',\n",
       "  '2012-11-15',\n",
       "  'Chris Dodd, former Democratic senator from Connecticut and current chairman and chief executive officer of the Motion Picture Association of America, is riding in the passenger seat of a Dodge Avenger making its way down Lombard Street in San Francisco, and he’s lobbying the driver. “I’ll tell ya—motion pictures! Nobody realizes how many people are employed by this industry—2.1 million people in this country got up today and went to work on a job dependent on the movie and television industry. And these are good jobs. In what other industry can you get a job, a high-paying job, without a college degree?”He pauses. “Not that I’m against college,” he says. He points out that he served on the U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions and was chairman of the subcommittee on children and families. “I care deeply—deeply!—about education. I’ve got two daughters, both in public school. These kids today have so much homework, is that really good for them? I don’t know. I’ll tell ya, it’s not bad to take some time, go at your own pace, find yourself. Let kids figure out what they want to do.\\u2009… My younger brother Jeremy, he’s the most interesting guy I know, and I don’t know what the f-\\u200d-\\u200d- he does. You’ve got to live!” Pretty soon, Dodd launches into another reminiscence about his days in the Senate, this one involving Howard Baker, Alan Cranston, and a violation of Senate Dining Room etiquette.Part of spending time with Chris Dodd is regularly being treated to his very funny, and sometimes unprintable, stories from his 30 years in the Senate. In March 2011, the MPAA tapped Dodd to assume the job once held by the late Jack Valenti, the legendary power broker who served as Hollywood’s lobbyist in Washington for 38 years. Dodd has since moved into the same plush I Street office Valenti used to schmooze generations of legislators. Dodd’s $1.5 million salary, and the entire $50 million budget of the 200-employee MPAA, are paid by the six major Hollywood studios— Fox, Warner Bros., Walt Disney, Universal Pictures, Sony, and Paramount—and one associate member, the CBS television network. But while Valenti’s tenure was dominated by cultural battles over things like movie decency ratings, Dodd’s mandate is purely economic: figure out how to protect Hollywood’s products from being illegally downloaded on the Internet and, often, sold as bootleg DVDs.It’s difficult to come up with a definitive number for how much online piracy actually hurts the film industry. The MPAA claims it costs U.S. businesses $58 billion and 373,000 jobs a year; Julian Sanchez, a research fellow at the Cato Institute, estimates the cost to the U.S. economy is less than $500 million. Still, considering what happened to the music industry, where global music sales have declined from $15 billion in 1999 to less than $6 billion in 2010 due in large part to illegal downloads, the entertainment conglomerates that own the movie studios can’t afford to take a wait-and-see approach. But if you were looking for an expert on intellectual-property copyright protection in a multiplatform, technologically evolving, global market, would a retired 68-year-old politician really be the first choice?“I might join you in the observation that Chris Dodd is not the guy,” laughs Chris Dodd. “But I’m a quick learner. I wasn’t an expert on health care. I wasn’t an expert on financial services\\u2006…\\u2009yet I put together bills that fundamentally changed the structure of the health-care industry and the financial structure of this country. I don’t think you need to know every detail about the damn thing to be effective.”\\n \\n \\nDodd is white-haired and ruddy-faced yet retains the vigor that made him such an effective five-term senator. He says that upon retiring from the Senate, after a controversy in which he allegedly received loans at a preferred interest rate from Countrywide Financial when he chaired the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, he never intended to stop working. (A Senate ethics panel cleared Dodd of any wrongdoing.) “Ten different law firms were asking after me,” he says. “I have young kids. I have to do something. Forty years of public life. You don’t just hang around after that.”  Dodd is the latest high-profile legislator to spin through the revolving door connecting members of Congress to highly paid lobbying jobs. While he had the good taste to work for an industry outside of areas where he had drafted major legislation, he’s still a beneficiary of Washington’s money culture. “Hollywood is essentially buying his Rolodex,” says Craig Holman of Public Citizen, a government watchdog organization. “They hired him because of all his connections in Congress, because they know [members of Congress] will take his calls.”Lorne Michaels, the executive producer of Saturday Night Live and a longtime friend of Dodd’s, says the former senator has taken over at a time when “the MPAA needs to be redefined a little bit. The world has changed. Movie companies are divisions of bigger conglomerates that have different lobbyists and different agendas. But American entertainment is one of our largest exports. It needs to be represented in Washington in the same way our other industries are.”Michaels adds: “And it doesn’t hurt that he’s a star. People in my industry like talking to him.”Dodd himself was surprised at how many of the players in the entertainment industry, so grandiose in their self-regard in most circumstances, shied away from speaking up for their interests in the company of Washington heavyweights. Early last year he was attending a Los Angeles dinner given by Austan Goolsbee, former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. “I’ve been on the job a week, and I hardly know these people,” recalls Dodd. “There’s Barry Diller [chairman of IAC], Ron Meyer [president and COO of Universal], Bob Iger [chief executive officer of Disney], Jim Gianopulos [chairman and CEO of Fox], Michael Lynton [CEO of Sony America], Les Moonves [president and CEO of CBS], and so, well, I eat my hors d’oeuvres, I eat my main course, and I’m listening to this conversation: It’s about Iraq, Afghanistan, the budget. Finally I say, ‘Do you mind if we spend five minutes talking about our actual business?’ The next day, they were all calling me saying, ‘Thank you. Thank you.’ You see, these guys still have this attitude that we’re not a serious business.” Dodd says he’d like to change that. “We bring more revenue back to the U.S. than agriculture, automobiles, and aerospace,” he says.Dodd’s tenure at the MPAA got off to a rocky start. Under federal law, he’s banned from directly lobbying his former counterparts in the Senate or House of Representatives until January 2013. And the industry is still reeling from the public-relations disaster that was the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA). Intended to expand the ability of U.S. law enforcement to stop Internet trafficking of stolen content and counterfeit goods, SOPA was sponsored in October 2011 by 50 members of Congress. The MPAA, Recording Industry Association of America, major entertainment conglomerates, software companies—basically everyone who holds copyrights—strongly supported it.Lined up against them were Silicon Valley and the tech industry—basically those who distribute copyrighted content—who claimed the legislation would allow the government to shut down websites and penalize legitimate businesses without justification or accountability. Critics of the bill vilified its supporters as opponents of free speech. On Jan. 18, Wikipedia and about 7,000 other sites took down their services for 24 hours to protest SOPA. Google displayed a black banner, and members of Congress reported receiving 7 million e-mails urging them to vote against the bill.Dodd, who joined the MPAA after the bill was already in motion, says he had reservations about SOPA from the beginning. For one thing, he felt it was introduced too late in the legislative season. “If you haven’t moved a bill through one or the other house before the August break, as you are coming into the election-year cycle, you run the risk of it dying,” he says. “The clock becomes the 101st senator. I’m not clairvoyant, but I knew we were in trouble.”Still, he had never seen a bill generate so large a negative response so quickly. “Even if I had been able to lobby, it wouldn’t have made a difference,” Dodd says. “This was a runaway horse.”Sponsor Lamar Smith (R-Tex.) withdrew SOPA on Jan. 20. Its failure taught Dodd a crucial lesson: You can’t fight the tech industry. SNL’s Michaels recalls a fellow Hollywood mogul telling him, “I’ve been to the White House eight times, and every time I’m there, [Google Chairman] Eric Schmidt is already on his way out.” The problem—described by California Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom as a “North-South divide”—is that the entertainment industry was viewing the tech industry as an adversary. “And it’s not smart to try to fight Google,” Dodd says.Richard Plepler, CEO of HBO, believes Dodd recognizes the need to soothe relations with Silicon Valley. “He’s a consensus builder,” he says. “He knows how to build alliances. He had virtually no enemies in a town known for vicious tribal warfare. That should translate very well in this gig. He can bring together Northern California and Southern California. That’s his unique ability.”While his constituents believe as fervently as ever that online piracy remains the biggest threat to their industry—“This is what keeps us awake at night,” says Mitch Singer, Sony Pictures’ chief digital strategy officer—Dodd now insists a business alliance between tech companies and content companies is the only way forward. He cites one model of a business-based compromise between the two industries: Google’s decision to tweak its algorithm so that sites with pirated content don’t show up near the top in search results. “These businesses need each other,” he says. “Content and technology have a natural affinity for each other.\\u2009… It serves the technology companies’ interests to connect consumers with legal content.” At this point, Dodd concedes, the solution is unlikely to come out of Washington. “That path is dead.”\\n \\n \\nThat’s one reason he’s here in San Francisco, to address the Commonwealth Club and meet with tech executives. First, though, he pays a visit to the headquarters of Lucasfilm, in a converted Army hospital in San Francisco’s Presidio, a former military base adjacent to the Golden Gate Bridge. There’s a statue of Yoda out front and a Darth Vader mannequin in the lobby; virtually everywhere you turn in the sky-lit corridors are various pieces of film memorabilia—the bike from ET, the hook from Hook, Han Solo in carbonite from Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back.  Dodd is led down the halls by the Lucasfilm public-relations team. Part of his job as head cheerleader for his industry is to nod appreciatively and say, periodically, “Isn’t that incredible?”Dodd professes to be a lifelong movie fan, though he’s quick to add, “I’m not encyclopedic about it.” He’s less interested in seeing, say, the Blue Fairy from A.I. or the poster for Ghostbusters II than in talking about his role in various legislative triumphs, like the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993. (“Clinton says it was the bill he is proudest of signing, and he’d only been in office 15 minutes when he signed it,” Dodd recalls.) Because he’s a late-in-life father—“I’m the only person I know who receives mail from AARP and diaper services”—he says he now sees many more films than he ever had before. “I need to know what my kids are watching. I must have seen Rango five times.”At a conference room overlooking San Francisco Bay, he sits down with Lucasfilm and Industrial Light & Magic executives to talk about that North-South divide. David Anderman, general counsel for Lucasfilm, points to the “fundamental disconnect” between Hollywood and Silicon Valley: “Content companies make money from scarcity of content, and tech companies make it through ubiquity of content.”Dodd asks for a cup of coffee and goes into what has become his post-Senate stump speech, praising Hollywood as a job creation machine, insisting the divide isn’t real, that Hollywood studios are tech companies—“Look at what you guys do. This is a content company and a tech company.” He also points out the considerable cross-pollination that already exists in the boardrooms: Disney’s Iger sits on Apple’s board, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg is on Disney’s board, and so on. But he laments the persistent lack of cooperation between the two industries. “We need to get together a functional working group,” he says. “There has to be clear communication. That’s in everyone’s best interest.”The next thing worrying the executives around the table is that other countries, notably New Zealand and the U.K., are subsidizing film production with tax credits that are luring American special effects film production offshore. Dodd nods as he listens, but he clearly isn’t interested in (as he would later tell me) “making a presentation to the Senate Finance Committee on behalf of the MPAA about subsidizing Hollywood. People have a negative reaction to that.” Before the meeting wraps up, Dodd smiles and says, “Anything else you want to pick on a former senator about?”\\n \\n \\n“Come on,” Dodd is saying a few hours later, sitting down for dinner at a restaurant in the Ritz-Carlton Hotel. “You’ve gotta have some wine!” He orders a bottle of malbec and asks his body man, Mike McKiernan, for a score in the Red Sox game.Known as a bon vivant early in his career—he was romantically linked to Bianca Jagger and Carrie Fisher as a young senator—Dodd retains a career politician’s need to be in the thick of a crowd and the center of attention.“You know what I was wondering?” He turns to his dinner mates, who include Jason Allen, a director of corporate communications for Sony, and Singer, the Sony digital strategy chief. “Movie trailers are expensive to make.\\u2009… Why don’t you provide people an opportunity, with their BlackBerry or something, when they see the trailer they have an app so they can buy the ticket right there? And when the movie comes out, they can go to any theater in the world and, maybe it’s a dollar or two cheaper that way.”Allen nods, “That’s a great idea.”Over dinner, Dodd alternates between more Senate stories—“I was with Alan Simpson and someone asked, ‘Did you ever smoke dope?’ He said, ‘No, but I would have if it was around. It just wasn’t around’”— and wrestling with the issues of his current job. On piracy, Dodd has made progress building nongovernmental solutions. In August he announced an agreement between the MPAA and several of the largest Internet service providers, including Verizon, Comcast, and Time Warner Cable, to warn copyright infringers they are violating the law and eventually, after repeated threats, to slow down or even disconnect their service. It’s known as the Six-Strikes Anti-Piracy Program, which doesn’t sound as tough as, say, baseball’s three-strike policy, but it’s a start. “The idea is that after one or two notices, you’re so embarrassed, you stop,” Dodd says. “Eventually, there is a sword of Damocles that hangs over them.\\u2009… This is a way to do something that stops short of regulatory.”Dodd continues for a while in this vein, until the conversation starts to get technical. Singer begins explaining Ultraviolet, a new digital rights and authentication system that allows buyers of legitimate content to access their content over multiple platforms and devices. The conversation gets very geeky, very quickly, drawing in mentions of different applications and formats.Dodd sips his wine, listening, then shakes his head. “I don’t understand it all.\\u2009… The consumer wants to know, how do I navigate all this? Help me navigate this. We all get tired of this crap. At what point, even with the iPhone 5, at what point do you say, slow down, stop for chrissake, give me a chance to catch up? I’m not 14. Can I get something and rely on it for the next five years?”He pours himself another glass of wine and changes the subject. “So I was with Teddy Kennedy the night he debated Mitt Romney …”'),\n",

       "  'We thought originally that Sandy was going to arrive between 12 p.m. and 2 p.m. on Monday. It takes 12 hours to shut the transit system down, so we stopped it Sunday evening. Could we have gotten everybody into work on Monday? Yes, but we wouldn’t have had a chance to get them home. I had to take that into account. There was some grumbling on Twitter about that decision—New Yorkers are very demanding, and they want all their services regardless of the weather.The surge was far beyond anything I had expected. My worst-case scenario was exceeded in three minutes. The water from the Hudson River rushed into the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel at such a fast pace that there were whitewater rapids. The noise was disorienting. I immediately went back to the office and made everyone aware of what I saw.Afterwards, I wanted to open the system as quickly as possible. New York’s economy couldn’t work if the MTA didn’t exist; 8½ million people are in my hands every day. We realized we couldn’t get people through seven underwater subway tunnels between Queens and Brooklyn into Manhattan—they were flooded. We looked at our assets and said, OK, what do we do? We used 330 of our buses to take people from Brooklyn to Manhattan. When we started that last Thursday, there was a lot of queueing, especially at the new Barclays Center. Everybody was congregating together. On Friday we took a page out of Disney’s management of crowd control. In conjunction with the NYPD, we put up different walkways that go back and forth and zigzag. We put 3,700 people an hour onto buses. It was as close to a military-style operation as you could possibly imagine. By the way, the lost revenue that we’re seeing? We’ll be asking the Federal Emergency Management Agency to reimburse us for that.I had to manage the expectations of the governor, the expectations of the people of New York, the expectations of the press. My style is to underpromise and overdeliver. I spent 15 years in investment banking. You can’t get customers or clients if you’re abrasive. Handling a crisis is similar to being a football player.

Now, 14 years and a technological lifetime later, the Federal Trade Commission is updating those rules (PDF). While privacy advocates and all manner of organizations concerned about marketing to kids have been pushing for further restrictions, companies such as Walt Disney and Facebook are already angling for exemptions.Coppa, as the existing regulation is called, requires websites aimed at kids to get parental consent before gathering information about those users who are under 13. But data brokers and the companies they work for have found a way around that. Software installed on kids’ websites can collect personal information without parents’ approval. The companies operating the sites can argue that they aren’t responsible for what the brokers are doing. Now the FTC wants to hold both the brokers and the sites responsible for getting permission from parents to track their kids online.“We think that sharing responsibility between data collectors and site operators is important,” says Iona Rusu, the regulatory counsel at the Consumers Union. “The companies are the ones allowing it, and they should be the ones who have to give notification.”Here’s the other reality the FTC is trying to catch up to: Twenty-two percent of 5- to 8-year-olds use a computer at least once a day, and another 46 percent use it at least once a week, according to a 2011 study (PDF) by Common Sense Media, a nonprofit in San Francisco that studies media’s impact on children. More than a third of all children 8 or younger have used a cell phone, iPod, iPad, or similar device to play games, use apps, or watch videos, TV shows, or movies. By the time they’re in the 5- to 8-year-old age range, half have done so at one point.“The FTC’s recommended rules will help ensure that parents have better information and tools and that parents—not third-party ad networks and data brokers—get to decide when their children’s personal information can—and can’t—be collected, shared, and sold,” wrote James Steyer, the founder of Common Sense Media, in an e-mail.Without knowing it, these kids are leaving important clues for marketers all over the place. “Marketers want psychographic data—algorithms that can track the mood and emotional profile of a child,” says Joel Bakan, a lawyer and author of Childhood Under Siege: How Big Business Targets Children. “Reaching kids is all about getting at their emotions, titillating them, scaring them. What makes kids different from adults is that they can’t get outside their emotions and reflect on them. They are incredibly vulnerable to this kind of emotional manipulation.”He says that past enforcement of Coppa has been fairly lax and fines fairly minimal. “A change in law is necessary, but there has to be a change in enforcement, too,” Bakan says. The biggest penalty to date, according to the Wall Street Journal, was a $3 million fine paid by a subsidiary of Disney last year to settle charges that it illegally collected and disclosed personal information from hundreds of thousands of kids without their parents’ approval.“We have tried to be strategic in our enforcement efforts,” says Mary Engle, director of the FTC’s advertising practices division. “We have ratcheted up civil penalties. We do a lot that is invisible to the public: hand-holding, providing advice to companies, explaining the rules. Our goal is compliance.”The FTC asked for comments on the proposed rules and received hundreds. Among them were ones from Facebook and Disney. Facebook argued that software such as its “Like” button should be exempt since it isn’t used to target ads. Disney wants its site to be exempt because it’s aimed at families and not just kids. “We are concerned about the lobbying of the Walt Disney Co. and others to secure an exemption,” says Jeffrey Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, the organization that led the campaign in 1998 for regulation.Engle says she expects the FTC will hear from other companies, too. “We’re always trying to balance the need to implement our rules in a way that is sensitive to what’s feasible and practical for industry and provides protection.” The FTC is accepting comments until Sept. 10.'),\n",
       " ('How to Pay No Taxes: 10 Strategies Used by the Rich',\n",
       "  '2012-04-17',\n",
       "  'If you have lots of money, Tuesday, April 17, was one of the best tax days since the early 1930s: Top tax rates on ordinary income, dividends, estates, and gifts remain at or near historically low levels. That’s thanks, in part, to legislation passed in December 2010 by the 111th Congress and signed by President Barack Obama. Starting next January, rates may be headed higher.For the 400 U.S. taxpayers with the highest adjusted gross income, the effective federal income tax rate—what they actually pay—fell from almost 30 percent in 1995 to just over 18 percent in 2008, according to the Internal Revenue Service. And for the approximately 1.4 million people who make up the top 1 percent of taxpayers, the effective federal income tax rate dropped from 29 percent to 23 percent in 2008. It may seem too fantastic to be true, but the top 400 end up paying a lower rate than the next 1,399,600 or so.That’s not just good luck. It’s often the result of hard work, as suggested by some of the strategies below. Much of the income among the top 400 derives from dividends and capital gains, generated by everything from appreciated real estate—yes, there is some left—to stocks and the sale of family businesses. As Warren Buffett likes to point out, since most of his income is from dividends, his tax rate is less than that of the people who clean his office.The true effective rate for multimillionaires is actually far lower than that indicated by official government statistics. That’s because those figures fail to include the additional income that’s generated by many sophisticated tax-avoidance strategies. Several of those techniques involve some variation of complicated borrowings that never get repaid, netting the beneficiaries hundreds of millions in tax-free cash. From 2003 to 2008, for example, Los Angeles Dodgers owner and real estate developer Frank H. McCourt Jr. paid no federal or state regular income taxes, as stated in court records dug up by the Los Angeles Times. Developers such as McCourt, according to a declaration in his divorce proceeding, “typically fund their lifestyle through lines of credit and loan proceeds secured by their assets while paying little or no personal income taxes.” A spokesman for McCourt said he availed himself of a tax code provision at the time that permitted purchasers of sports franchises to defer income taxes.For those who can afford a shrewd accountant or attorney, our era is rife with opportunities to avoid—or at least defer—tax bills, according to tax specialists and public records. It’s limited only by the boundaries of taste, creativity, and the ability to understand some very complex shelters. Here’s a look at some of them:The ‘No Sale’ Sale\\nCashing in on stocks without triggering capital-gains taxesAn executive has $200 million of company shares. He wants cash but doesn’t want to trigger $30 million or so in capital-gains taxes.1. The executive borrows about $200 million from an investment bank, with the shares as collateral. Now he has cash.2. To freeze the value of the collateral shares, he buys and sells “puts” and “calls.” These are options granting him the right to buy and sell them later at a fixed price, insuring against a crash.3. He eventually can return the cash, or he can keep it. If he keeps it, he has to hand over the shares. The tax bill comes years after the initial borrowing. His money has been working for him all the while.Seller beware: The IRS challenged versions of these deals used by billionaire Philip Anschutz and Clear Channel Communications co-founder Red McCombs. A U.S. Tax Court judge in 2010 ruled that Anschutz owed $94 million in taxes on transactions entered into in 2000 and 2001. He lost an appeal last December. McCombs settled his case in 2011. Despite the court cases, such strategies “are alive and well,” says Robert Willens, who runs an independent firm that advises investors on tax issues.The Skyscraper Shuffle\\nPartnerships that let property owners liquidate without liabilityTwo people are 50-50 owners, through a partnership, of an office tower worth $100 million. One of the owners—let’s call him McDuck—wants to cash out, which would mean a $50 million gain and $7.5 million in capital-gains taxes.1. McDuck needs to turn his ownership of the property into a loan. So the partnership borrows $50 million and puts it into a new subsidiary partnership, which contributes the cash to yet another new partnership.2. The newest partnership lends that $50 million to a finance company for three years, in exchange for a three-year note. (The finance company takes the money and invests it or lends it out at a higher rate.)3. The original partnership distributes its interest in the lower-tier subsidiary to McDuck. Now, McDuck owns a loan note worth $50 million instead of the property, effectively liquidating his 50 percent interest.4. Three years later, the note is repaid. McDuck now owns 100 percent of a partnership sitting on a $50 million pile of cash—the amount McDuck would have received from selling his stake in the real estate—without triggering any capital-gains tax.5. While this cash remains in the partnership, it can be invested or borrowed against. When McDuck dies, it can be passed along to heirs and liquidated or sold tax-free. The deferred tax liability disappears upon McDuck’s death, under a provision that eliminates such taxable gains for heirs.The Estate Tax Eliminator\\nHow to leave future stock earnings to the kids and escape the estate taxA wealthy parent with millions invested in the stock market wants to leave future earnings to his kids while avoiding the estate tax on those earnings.1. The parent sets up a Grantor Retained Annuity Trust, or GRAT, listing the kids as beneficiaries.2. The parent contributes, say, $100 million to the GRAT. Under the terms of the GRAT, the amount contributed to the trust, plus interest, must be fully returned to the parent over a predetermined period.3. Whatever return the money earns in excess of the interest rate—the IRS currently requires 3 percent—remains in the trust and gets passed on to the heirs, forever free of estate and gift taxes.Executives Who Have Done It:\\n• GE Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Immelt\\n• Nike CEO Philip Knight\\n• Morgan Stanley CEO James GormanThe Trust Freeze\\n“Freezing” the value of an estate, so taxes don’t eat up its future appreciationA wealthy couple wants to leave a collection of income-producing assets, such as investment partnerships that own shares valued at as much as $150 million, to their children. So they “freeze” the value of the estate at that moment, maybe 20 years before their death, pushing any future appreciation out of the estate and avoiding what could be a $50 million federal estate tax bill.1. The best approach is an “intentionally defective grantor trust.” The couple makes a gift of $10 million—the maximum amount exempt from the gift tax for the next two years—to the trust, which lists the children as beneficiaries.2. The trust uses that cash as a down payment to buy the partnership from the parents through a note issued to the parents, but the partnership contains a restriction on the trust’s use of the assets, thus impairing the partnership’s value by, say, 33 percent. That enables the trust to buy the $150 million partnership for just $100 million.3. The income produced by the investment partnership helps pay off the note. The tax bill on that income is borne by the parents, essentially allowing gifts exempt from the gift tax.4. When the note is paid off, the trust owns that $150 million worth of assets, minus the $90 million note and interest—plus any appreciation in the meantime. The trust has swept up a $150 million income-producing concern without triggering the federal estate tax.The Option Option\\nStock options allow executives to calibrate the taxes on their compensation in a big wayAn executive is negotiating his employment contract for the coming five years. The company might offer millions in shares. But who wants to pay taxes on millions in shares?Better to take options. The executive owns the right to buy the shares at a time of his choosing; he’s been compensated, but he hasn’t paid any taxes. Gains from nonqualified stock options, the most common form, aren’t taxed until the holder exercises them. That means the executive controls when and if the tax bill comes. It isn’t just icing, either. Often it’s the cake.Executives Who Have Done It (CEOs or co-CEOs as of 2010):\\n• Lawrence Ellison, Oracle\\n• Philippe Dauman, Viacom\\n• Michael White, DirecTV\\n• Andrew Gould, Schlumberger\\n• Dave Cote, Honeywell\\n• David Pyott, Allergan\\n• Marc Benioff, Salesforce.com\\n• Sanjay Jha, Motorola Mobility\\n• Richard Fairbank, Capital One\\n• Howard Schultz, Starbucks\\n• Jay Johnson, General Dynamics\\n• Larry Nichols, Devon Energy\\n• Muhtar Kent, Coca-Cola\\n• Paul Jacobs, Qualcomm\\n• James Rohr, PNC Financial\\n• Louis Chênevert, United Technologies\\n• Fred Smith, FedEx\\n• Bob Kelly, Bank of New York Mellon\\n• William Weldon, Johnson & Johnson\\n• Clarence Cazalot Jr., Marathon Oil\\n• Ed Breen, Tyco\\n• David Speer, Illinois Tool Works\\n• Bob Iger, Disney\\n• Sam Allen, Deere\\n• John Hess, Hess\\n• Klaus Kleinfeld, Alcoa\\n• Bob Stevens, Lockheed Martin\\n• Rich Meelia, Covidien\\n• Dean Scarborough, Avery Dennison\\n• George Buckley, 3M\\n• Daniel DiMicco, Nucor\\n• John Donahoe, EBay\\n• Michael Strianese, L-3 Communications\\n• Ellen Kullman, DuPont\\n• Ronald Hermance, Hudson City Bancorp\\n• Rich Templeton, Texas Instruments\\n• Alan Boeckmann, Fluor\\n• Jen-Hsun Huang, Nvidia\\n• William Sullivan, Agilent Technologies\\n• Greg Brown, Motorola Solutions\\n• Jim McNerney, Boeing\\n• Michael McGavick, XL Group\\n• Scott McGregor, Broadcom\\n• Frederick Waddell, Northern Trust\\n• David Mackay, Kellogg\\n• John Brock, Coca-Cola Enterprises\\n• George Paz, Express Scripts\\n• Robert Parkinson, Baxter International\\n• Shantanu Narayen, Adobe\\n• Charles Davidson, Noble Energy\\n• John Pinkerton, Range Resources\\n• Gregory Boyce, Peabody Energy\\n• Kevin Mansell, Kohl’s\\n• Richard Davis, U.S. Bancorp\\n• Michael McCallister, Humana\\n• Timothy Ring, C.R.

Separately, the investor has other shares that are down an equal amount; if he were to sell them, he’d realize a loss to offset the gains and pay no taxes. But no one likes to sell low. So he wants to use that loss without actually selling the shares. IRS rules prohibit investors from taking a loss against a gain and then buying the shares back within 30 days.1. At least 31 days before the planned sale, the investor buys an equal value of additional shares of the underwater stock.2. The investor buys a “put” option on the new shares at their current price and sells a “call” option. Now he’s protected from the downside on that second purchase.3. At least 31 days later, the investor sells the first block of underwater shares. He now has his tax loss, without having taken any additional downside risk from the purchase of the second block of shares.The Friendly Partner\\nWith this deal, an investor can sell property without actually selling—or incurring taxesAn investor owns a piece of income-producing real estate worth $100 million. It’s fully depreciated, so the tax basis is zero. That means a potential (and unacceptable) $15 million capital-gains tax.1. Instead of an outright sale, the owner forms a partnership with a buyer.2. The owner contributes the real estate to the partnership. The buyer contributes cash or other property.3. The partnership borrows $95 million from a bank, using the property as collateral. (The seller must retain some interest in the partnership, hence the extra $5 million.)4. The partnership distributes the $95 million in cash to the seller.Note: The $95 million is viewed as a loan secured by the property contributed by the seller instead of proceeds from a sale. For tax purposes, the seller is not technically a seller, so any potential tax bill is deferred.The Big Payback\\nSo-called permanent life insurance policies are loaded with tax-avoiding benefitsA billionaire wants to invest but doesn’t need the returns any time soon and wants to avoid the tax on the profits.A world of tax-beating products is available through the insurance industry. Many types of so-called permanent life insurance—including whole life, universal life, and variable universal life insurance—combine a death benefit with an investment vehicle. The returns and the death benefit are free of income tax. If the policy is owned by a certain type of trust, the estate tax can be avoided as well. “It is a crucial piece of any high-net-worth tax planning in my experience,” says Michael D. Weinberg, president of an insurance firm that specializes in planning for high-net-worth individuals.IRA Monte Carlo\\nTax advisers recommend converting traditional IRAs to Roth IRAs—soonHigh-income taxpayers can now convert traditional IRAs—which allow contributions to be deducted from taxes but incur taxes on distributions—into Roth IRAs, in which contributions are taxed but the distributions are tax-free. The conversion triggers a one-time tax bill, based on the value of the newly converted Roth IRA. As one might expect, tax experts are recommending that high-net-worth individuals convert their traditional IRAs to Roth IRAs before 2013, when ordinary income rates are likely to go up.1. Let’s say an investor has one traditional IRA with a value of $4 million.2. The traditional IRA is split up into four traditional IRAs, each worth $1 million.3. The investor converts all four to Roth IRAs at the beginning of the year.4. The IRS effectively allows taxpayers to undo the conversion for up to 21 months. So in 21 months, the investor looks at the performance of the IRAs. Say two of them go up, from $1 million to $2 million, and two drop, from $1 million to zero. Because the IRAs were split into four, the investor can change her mind on the two that went down and revert those back to traditional IRAs. Thus, she owes taxes on only the two contributions that went up in value, and nothing on the two that went down, cutting her tax bill in half. This lops 21 months of risk off the bet that paying taxes now will be paid off with tax-free appreciation later.The Venti\\nPutting a chunk of pay in a deferred-compensation plan can mean decades of tax-free growthExecutives want generous pay but don’t want immediate tax bills from salaries or cash bonuses.Instead, they elect to set aside a portion of their pay into a deferred-compensation plan. Such plans allow the compensation, plus earnings, to grow tax-deferred, potentially for decades.Executives Who Have Done It:\\n• Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz\\n• Verizon Communications CEO Ivan G.

       "  '2012-04-12',\n",
       "  'Avner Ronen, an Israeli entrepreneur who lives in New York City, doesn’t normally pay much attention to American politics. Then in January he realized his company, the Internet video provider Boxee, had a lot to lose by ignoring Washington. He set up a meeting with Federal Communications Commission Chairman Julius Genachowski and booked three train tickets to Washington. Two were for Ronen and the startup’s sole lawyer. The third was for an intern who, for the purposes of the Genachowski meeting, got the title Head of Government Relations.Wearing a hoodie to maintain his startup vibe, Ronen showed how owners of the Boxee Box, a $180 device made by D-Link that aggregates videos from all over the Web and displays them on a TV set, can seamlessly flip between Major League Baseball games, Netflix, and a reality show. He pleaded for FCC officials to reject proposed rules that put Boxee at a disadvantage to big cable-TV providers. “Definitely startups, but tech in general, don’t focus on D.C. as much,” Ronen says. “We’re not speaking D.C.-speak or FCC-speak, for good or for worse.”Boxee is embroiled in a spat with Comcast, News Corp., and Walt Disney, companies that own cable channels and are much more fluent in the language of Washington. The entertainment heavyweights are among those backing a rule the FCC proposed in October that would allow cable operators to encrypt all their TV transmissions. That would be a blow to Boxee, which allows cable subscribers to plug their cords directly into Boxee Boxes—bypassing the cable companies’ own set-top boxes, and giving expensive dramas like Mad Men equal billing with YouTube’s dog-on-skateboard videos. If the rule goes into effect, people using Boxee to watch cable will only see static. Other set-top boxes such as Apple TV, Roku, and Google TV could be affected in the future, though they don’t currently allow for cable-TV input.In public filings with the FCC, the cable companies say encryption would allow them to shut off service remotely when a customer moves instead of making them wait for a technician, and would minimize cable theft. Third parties like Boxee would be able to decrypt and display cable-video feeds if they include a special chip in their devices, though the Consumer Electronics Association argues that such a step is too costly and cumbersome for hardware manufacturers. Comcast and News Corp. declined to comment, and Disney didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment.Christopher King, an analyst for Stifel Nicolaus, says the cable companies probably won’t fret over Boxee’s troubles. The startup has actively pushed the idea that homeowners should give up their costly cable plans and rely instead on free, over-the-air network broadcasts and Internet video—all aggregated by a Boxee Box, of course. The more TV watchers rely on such devices, “the less power that cable companies and the content providers have in the long run,” says King.Ronen first learned about the obscure encryption rule two months after the FCC proposed it, when intern Nick Miller received a Facebook message about it from a concerned user. “There’s no attempt by the regulatory groups to actually talk to us,” says Miller. “None of us had ever dealt with the FCC. So it took us a while to figure out, OK, how are we going to approach this problem? What are the options that are open to us?”Taking a page from the Internet industry’s recent defeat of the media industry-backed Stop Online Piracy Act, Boxee has rallied some of its 2 million users through blogs and social networks, asking them to voice their opposition to the FCC rule. About 2,000 people have written detailed, personal messages, Ronen says. He hopes such grass-roots efforts can help narrow the spending gap: While Comcast, News Corp., and Disney dedicated a combined $30.6 million to lobbying last year, according to OpenSecrets.org, Boxee can’t afford to spend more than $50,000. “I don’t believe it is realistic to expect startups to pay too much attention to regulatory and legislative proceedings,” Ronen says. “I guess one lesson to other startups is that if there is an issue that concerns you, it may be worth a trip to D.C.”The bottom line: The startup Boxee has only $50,000 to fight a cable company-backed FCC rule that would limit the usefulness of its set-top box.'),\n",
       " (\"Obama's New Campaign Weapon: His Pen\",\n",
       "  '2012-03-01',\n",
       "  'As he gets ready for the fall campaign, Barack Obama is working to win over his most important constituents one pen stroke at a time. Stymied by Republican opposition in Congress, the president has turned to the powers of his office, issuing executive orders and other actions that enable him to bypass Capitol Hill and appeal to the concerns of Democratic voters.For environmentalists, Obama stopped the Keystone XL pipeline and raised auto fuel efficiency standards. For young people, he declared new rules to ease repayment of student loans. For Hispanics, he tweaked federal immigration policy, curtailing deportations of illegal immigrants who arrived as children and those who served in the armed forces. The president stood with women’s groups in demanding free insurance coverage for contraception. Consumer advocates won the recess appointment of a financial industry watchdog. For unions, the president filled three vacant seats on the National Labor Relations Board, restoring a quorum required for the panel to make decisions.The executive orders may help reverse a perception of presidential haplessness that set in with some of Obama’s allies last summer, after he spent months trying to reach a debt deal with Republican leaders, says Democratic pollster Andrew Baumann. It “creates a sense with his base voters that he’s fighting.”As a candidate in 2008, Obama scorned the kind of political giveaways presidents often use to help them win reelection. Now he’s doling out some of his own. Many of his directives are aimed at voters in states where he most needs votes. During an October trip to Nevada, an epicenter of the housing bust and an important state to win in November, he announced rules easing mortgage refinancing for homeowners who owe more than their property is worth. In January, he flew to Walt Disney World to unveil a federal initiative to promote tourism. For beleaguered manufacturing workers in Ohio, he created a new trade enforcement center to investigate unfair practices by China and other trading partners.None of this has gone unnoticed by Republicans. “Goodies to his political allies,” says Brendan Buck, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio). No doubt, but the GOP didn’t protest when George W. Bush, running for a second term in 2004, used his executive powers to dole out treats to Republican voters. A staunch free trader, Bush imposed tariffs on steel imports, which was popular in Ohio, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania. Five months before the election, he tightened travel restrictions to Cuba, a nod to the exile community in Florida.A tally of executive orders shows Obama has actually resorted to them less often than other recent presidents. Last year he issued 34 executive orders. He averaged 36 per year during his first three years in office, according to the National Archives.It’s hard to say whether any of this will translate into votes. At the least, it may help keep allies from straying. Until recently, Hispanic immigration advocates had been very critical of Obama’s immigration policy—they wanted him to stop the deportation of undocumented college students, veterans, and spouses of military personnel. They now praise the president for ordering a review of deportation cases and directing officials to focus on illegal immigrants who have committed crimes. “They coincide specifically with what we asked him to do,” says Representative Luis Gutierrez (D-Ill.), who was arrested outside the White House last summer while protesting record deportations under Obama. Before the president acted, Gutierrez says, Hispanic activists were “very, very angry and disillusioned.”The bottom line: A string of executive orders and other decisions is helping Obama reach out to voters in key Democratic strongholds.'),\n",
       " ('Getting Principals to Think Like Managers',\n",
       "  '2012-02-16',\n",
       "  'Kim Lowry, principal of South Elementary, a 500-student school in rural Kennett, Mo., was wary when her superintendent enrolled her in a part-time, two-year business school program. Her school had failed to meet benchmarks under the federal No Child Left Behind law and faced a state takeover. Business classes were the last thing she wanted to do with the money earmarked for improving her school. Says Lowry: “I was very resistant.”That changed in the summer of 2009, when she attended her first classes at the University of Virginia’s Darden School of Business. Under the guidance of professors there, she wrote a plan for transforming her school. That fall she formed teams of teachers that scrutinized student performance, hired consultants to help improve scores on standardized tests, and posted the results of every student in the staff lounge, making teachers publicly accountable for their classes. “I took the best business practices and translated those into education,” says Lowry, who completed the program in January. Her school now meets federal standards, and its test scores jumped by 26 percent in English and 29 percent in math while she was in the program.The White House wants to help fix 5,000 underperforming schools, and the Education Dept. has distributed more than $4 billion in federal School Improvement Grants in the last few years. That has given school districts both the motivation and the funds to change, and many are turning to Darden for help. Over the last eight years, Darden has worked with nearly 200 schools in 12 states.This year, 48 schools from Arizona, Utah, Nevada, Colorado, and New Mexico are among those enrolled in the program, and state education officials are participating alongside the principals. Those states want to “take [the UVA program] and create it in the Southwest” at a university in the region, says Paul Koehler, director of the Southwest Comprehensive Center, a nonprofit that advises states on how to fix troubled schools.Some education professionals question whether the results are worth the $75,000-per-school price tag for the two-year program, in which principals attend classes at Darden for a total of 20 days, UVA staffers visit the districts, and participants are in frequent contact with professors. Grover Whitehurst, an education policy analyst at the Brookings Institution, says Darden’s offering needs to be more “rigorously evaluated” if other states are to clone the idea. “It is important, before we start trying to replicate this, that we are pretty confident the results would hold up,” he says. Frederick Hess, an education scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, says the program may make administrators better managers, but it’s unclear whether they learn how to deal with the toughest challenges, such as negotiations with teachers’ unions.The program, a collaboration between Darden and UVA’s Curry School of Education, helps principals and administrators approach troubled schools with the eye of a manager, says Executive Director LeAnn Buntrock. Participants examine case studies on companies such as General Electric and Walt Disney, study organizational behavior, and learn how to analyze data. “We’re not trying to make businesses out of school systems, but certainly a lot of leadership and business principles apply,” Buntrock says.After the Cincinnati Public Schools began participating in the program in 2008, the district asked successful administrators and teachers to coach counterparts in struggling schools, and established a program that paired local business leaders with principals. Cincinnati saw 14 of its 16 underperforming schools meet No Child Left Behind standards after the program.At the first 57 schools that completed the program, reading proficiency increased an average of 33 percent and math scores rose an average of 37 percent, Darden says. But schools in St. Louis and Kansas City, Mo., and on Indian reservations have seen mediocre or negative results, and a handful have withdrawn from the program after the first year.This spring, Darden will add a “district boot camp” for superintendents and curriculum directors. They’ll attend the additional training session before principals take classes, with the idea that as soon as their schools start the program they’ll be able provide them with adequate support to make necessary changes. Says Buntrock: “This will give them more of a runway so they can hit the ground running.”The bottom line: A $75,000 B-school program for principals has improved test scores, but some experts say it may do little to fix the toughest problems.'),\n",

       "  '2012-02-14',\n",
       "  'Good news for cities still suffering from the recession: All but three of the nation’s 363 metro areas will add jobs this year, up from 241 last year. This according to an economic index published by the U.S. Conference of Mayors. The laggards are Odessa and Midland, Tex., and Carson City, Nev., which are the only metro areas projected to lose jobs in 2012.The big winner is a bit of a surprise: Florida, which has been especially hard-hit by the economic downturn. For years, hiring has been anemic, unemployment remains near record highs, and real estate prices are still dragging. (Check out this Miami Herald Economic Time Machine, which tracks 60 indicators of the local economy.)Seven of the 20 cities anticipating the most job growth are in Florida. Growth for the Naples-Marco Island area, the large metropolitan cluster on the Gulf Coast, is projected to be 2.6 percent; the projection for the Orlando I-4 corridor is 2.2 percent.What’s going on here? In a word, Disney World. Florida is a top holiday destination for South American tourists, and they flock to Disney, Universal Studios, and other theme parks and attractions. As domestic tourism has faltered and the dollar has weakened, the number of overseas visitors to Florida has climbed steadily. The number of tourists from Brazil alone is up by at least a third. The report’s author, economist Charles Dougherty of IHS Global Insight, a forecasting firm, writes that Florida leisure and hospitality payrolls are expected to increase by 3 percent in 2012, compared with 2.2 percent nationwide.Another big thing: the U.S.-Colombia Free Trade Agreement. Ratified by Congress in October, it is expected to give a strong boost to the state’s economy. Colombia is Florida’s second-largest trading partner. Nearly three-quarters of Colombia’s imports come through the Port of Miami, which is now undergoing a massive dredging project to handle the growing number of ships coming up from the Panama Canal.And finally, the housing market is starting to stabilize. Dougherty says total housing starts in Florida will grow 20 percent in 2012, compared with 15 percent nationwide. Median home prices are expected to grow on pace with the rest of the country at 1.1 percent.State politicians—and President Obama—will no doubt point to these numbers as evidence that their policies are slowly pulling up the economy. But the key word here is “slowly.” The report cautions that the uptick in growth won’t be enough to push the unemployment rate below 8 percent until after the fall elections.'),\n",

Two, actually.In 1958, Brooklyn Dodgers owner Walter O’Malley, after years of butting heads with New York master planner Robert Moses, moved his baseball team not to the borough of Queens, as Moses directed, but to Los Angeles, leaving a generation of Brooklynites devastated. Say you had a gun with two bullets, went a common refrain in New York that year, and you’re in a room with Hitler, Stalin, and O’Malley. Who would you shoot? The Dodger fan’s reply: “O’Malley, twice!”Breaking Brooklyn’s heart was good business. O’Malley’s Los Angeles Dodgers thrived, going on to win nine National League Championships and five World Series titles. Celebrated for breaking the color barrier by starting Jackie Robinson in 1947, the Dodgers, O’Malley, and his son Peter also gave baseball such transcendent figures as Sandy Koufax and Fernando Valenzuela. Then, in 1998, the family sold the franchise to News Corp. for $311 million, a decision Peter O’Malley, now 74, regrets so deeply, he’s trying to get the team back.In 2009 the Dodgers found themselves in the role of the kids caught in a nasty custody battle between its latest owners, Frank and Jamie McCourt. The former husband and wife, who made millions on parking lots in Boston, bought a controlling interest in the team for about $430 million in 2004. On their watch the Dodgers made it back to the National League Championship Series in 2008 and 2009. Last year’s Team Blue included the league’s best starting pitcher, Clayton Kershaw, and Matt Kemp, who was the runner-up for the league’s Most Valuable Player. But in the fall of 2009, according to court records, Frank, convinced Jamie was having an affair with a subordinate, fired her as the Dodgers’ chief executive officer. Jamie countered that her husband, the principal owner, simply wanted to cut her out of Dodger riches.The two lawyered up, and before the couple reached a divorce settlement in the fall of 2011, it emerged that the Dodgers were in serious financial trouble. The McCourts had withdrawn more than $100 million from the team—money that could have been used to build a championship team, or, more crucially, revamp Dodger Stadium. Instead, according to court documents, the money went toward furnishing mansions, flying in private jets, and retaining a $120,000-a-year personal hairstylist. The couple even had their Brookline (Mass.) kitchen moved piece-by-piece to L.A.’s “platinum triangle,” the enclave at the nexus of Beverly Hills, Holmby Hills, and Bel Air. Jamie McCourt’s ambitions went beyond the perfect kitchen. Court records show she considered starting a think tank called Dodger University, specializing in leadership. This she would ride to a bestselling book, election to mayor of L.A., governor of California, and ultimately the White House.The Dodgers filed for Chapter 11 in June 2011, after an eventful spring that saw Major League Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig announce he was seizing the team from Frank McCourt, and McCourt’s last-ditch efforts to raise some cash by signing a 17-year contract with Fox TV, a News Corp. subsidiary, one year before their contract was up for renewal. The TV rights deal included a personal loan to McCourt, according to MLB. Selig vetoed the Fox offer, and McCourt could not make payroll.In October the McCourts finally formalized a divorce settlement. Under its terms, Frank has until Apr. 30 to pay Jamie $131 million—money he expects to raise by selling the team out of bankruptcy. On Nov. 1, the Dodgers and MLB agreed to the endgame: McCourt would sell the team, and promptly, but only if a bankruptcy judge, and not Commissioner Selig, oversaw the process “in a manner designed to realize maximum value for the Dodgers and their owner Frank McCourt.” All of which set the stage for a dealmaking frenzy the likes of which Los Angeles hasn’t seen since Michael Milken was hosting his Predators Balls in the eighties.“It’s a sports-business circus here,” says David Carter, executive director of the Sports Business Institute at the University of Southern California. “Every day you see that someone else is throwing their hat in the ring or partnering with somebody.” The excitement and competition, sports owners add, is justified. “There are a handful of legacy clubs like the Dodgers in each league,” says Dave Checketts, the owner of the St. Louis Blues, who attempted to buy the Dodgers in 2004. “They’re in major markets and have a history of winning where if you do things right there’s an enormous upside.”The jockeying for the Dodgers got underway in earnest shortly after New Year’s, when McCourt and Blackstone, the investment bank representing the team in its sale, sent out a distinctive bid book to a roster of prospective owners. In addition to team financials, the parcel included a pair of official MLB game balls autographed by Matt Kemp and a team cap. According to a 22-page PDF listing application requirements for buyers and given to Bloomberg Businessweek by a prospective bidder’s representative, bidders had to offer a nonrefundable $25,000 entrance fee and provide proof of substantial liquid assets. Several people briefed on the bidding process, all of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed non-disclosure agreements, say McCourt aims to fetch in excess of $1.5 billion for the team—a record price for a sports franchise.Some of the figures who have expressed an interest in owning the Dodgers are not surprising: Laker, Dodger, and Yankee greats; local businessmen with an eye on the L.A. mayor’s office; and a handful of the wealthiest men in Los Angeles—biotech pioneer Patrick Soon-Shiong, supermarket mogul Ron Burkle, and real estate developer Rick Caruso. Mark Cuban, the billionaire owner of the Dallas Mavericks, made a cameo. (You can’t sell a premier sports franchise without a look from Cuban.) There’s also Steven Cohen, the hedge fund manager from Connecticut; South Korean retail giant E. Land; and whispers of a Saudi prince.A few have been down this road before. L.A. real estate billionaire Alan Casden tried and failed to buy the team from News Corp. in 2003, when he proposed razing Dodger Stadium to build housing on the site. “They knock down stadiums all the time,” Casden then told the Los Angeles Times. “It’s not Frank Lloyd Wright. It’s a nice place to play baseball, but there are far better.”St. Louis Rams owner Stan Kroenke, who is married to Wal-Mart heiress Ann Walton Kroenke, has submitted a bid, sparking talk of a National Football League stadium going up on the Dodgers’ sprawling campus, and bundling baseball and football into a multibillion-dollar media deal. Kroenke is no stranger to juggling multiple sports teams; in addition to the Rams, the 64-year-old owns the Colorado Avalanche, Colorado Rapids, and Britain’s Arsenal soccer club. Although the real estate developer is notoriously reclusive—he’s known as “Silent Stan”—he does have a home in Malibu. NFL rules prevent an owner from simultaneously owning a baseball franchise in one city and a football team in another, so either he divests his Rams stake to buy the Dodgers or moves the Rams back to L.A. Another theory holds that Kroenke is playing hardball with the city of St. Louis, using the threat of moving the club to get the city to pony up for a better stadium.Several media conglomerates, including Time Warner Cable, Comcast, and News Corp., are circling in pursuit of a TV deal, according to bankers involved in the negotiations. A long-term deal between the Dodgers and Time Warner, Comcast, or Fox for broadcast rights could hit more than $3 billion.“This is clearly a media play,” says Barry Frank, executive vice president of IMG Media Sports Programming and former head of CBS Sports. “You’re talking about the second-largest U.S. market that doesn’t have a pro football team, so baseball is even more important. Because they play 162 games as opposed to the Lakers, who only play 82, it’s virtually twice as valuable.” Last year, Time Warner struck a 20-year TV deal with the Lakers, locking out Fox Sports Prime Ticket, one of the company’s regional sports networks, from L.A.’s premier sports franchise.“To not have the Dodgers puts Prime Ticket in my mind at risk in its entirety,” Robert Thompson, the former president of Fox Sports, said in court in December. “Those rights,” says Frank, “are the most important thing that’s going to happen in the Los Angeles market.”For the first few weeks of January, prospective owners took tours of Dodger Stadium and the 300-acre Chavez Ravine, sampled Dodger Dogs, and surveyed earthquake-preparedness improvements to the 50-year-old complex overlooking downtown L.A. According to a person connected to one of the bids, several paid a visit to Earvin “Magic” Johnson in his Beverly Hills office. Johnson, the five-time National Basketball Assn. champion with the Los Angeles Lakers, aspires to become the next owner of the Dodgers. He has been a successful businessman in his post-basketball life—he owns several movie theaters, and until recently, 105 Starbucks outlets and a piece of the Lakers. Yet the 52-year-old’s foremost currency is his popularity with Los Angeles sports fans. Johnson declined to comment for this article.Magic is friends with Patrick Soon-Shiong, the founder of Abraxis BioScience and the richest man in L.A. In 2010, Johnson sold Soon-Shiong his minority stake in the Lakers. For most of a week in mid-January, Soon-Shiong looked as if he might make his own bid for the Dodgers, though he’s since backed off. Johnson, meanwhile, emerged as the face of a bid led by Stan Kasten, former president of the Atlanta Braves and Washington Nationals, and Mark Walter, CEO of Guggenheim Partners, the $125 billion investment firm in New York and Chicago. Kasten says he intends to relocate to Los Angeles if their bid succeeds.Some of those wishing to bid for the team, like the group led by former Dodger first baseman Steve Garvey and pitcher Orel Hershiser, whiffed. Garvey mistakenly assumed he had the backing of Harvey Schiller, the former president of Turner Sports. A person within Schiller’s group said that Schiller had no role in Garvey’s offer. Still others, instead of making their own bids, joined forces, as it appears former owner Peter O’Malley has with South Korea’s E. Land. Such foreign ownership is not common in MLB, but it’s not without precedent: Japan’s Nintendo owns the Seattle Mariners.Blackstone set a deadline of midnight, Jan. 23, for first-round bids. According to a person who has seen all of the bids, more than 12 were received and at least eight advanced to the second round. Mark Cuban didn’t bid enough to make round two. (Cuban declined to comment.)One of the eight finalists is Leo Hindery, a former cable executive who co-founded the New York Yankees’ lucrative YES Network. Hindery’s group includes partners Marc Utay, a New York financier, and Thomas Barrack Jr., CEO of $29 billion L.A. private equity real estate shop Colony Capital. Hindery, the former head of TCI and AT&T Broadband, turned YES—the Yankees Entertainment and Sports Network—into the biggest regional sports network in the country. The rationale for a team like the Dodgers to go it alone like YES is compelling: cut out the likes of Fox and Time Warner and own the network yourself, and you have leverage over cable operators. Not only do you sell advertising, you also collect a certain amount each month per subscriber.Given the $3 billion estimate for long-term media rights to the team, if Hindery could put together a YES-type network, a wholly Dodgers-owned enterprise could be valued in excess of that figure, says a person close to the bidding who was not authorized to speak on the record. Fox, which currently holds the rights to broadcast Dodgers games, is aware of the value of such an arrangement. Back in November, as MLB and McCourt were banging out the terms of the bankruptcy auction, Joseph Farnan, a mediator appointed by bankruptcy judge Kevin Gross, tried to arrange for Fox to buy McCourt out. According to two people with knowledge of the talks, the network, prodded by the mediator, made a $1.2 billion bid for the Dodgers. McCourt, who sought closer to $2 billion, rejected it.Supermarket mogul Ron Burkle is also dealing himself in. “It is one of the best brands in all of sports,” Burkle said in a Nov. 2 statement. “And, like many people, I’d be very proud to be a part of its future.” According to a person familiar with his role but not authorized to comment, Burkle is the wild card. He could add billionaire ballast to an offer assembled by Rick Caruso and former Dodger manager Joe Torre. (Torre resigned his position as executive vice-president of operations for MLB to avoid any conflict of interest.) Caruso, the CEO of his own real estate and retail conglomerate, Caruso Affiliated, has designs on the L.A. mayor’s office. The Caruso-Torre group could rope in Stanley Gold, too, the manager of Roy Disney’s estate.The Caruso-Torre team is one of three bids in the second round considered most likely to succeed, say five people briefed on the latest negotiations. The premium, they say, is secure financing from a single source. The other two front-runners: Magic Johnson, Mark Walter, and Stan Kasten, and SAC Capital Advisors founder Steven Cohen, who is worth $8.3 billion according to Forbes.Cohen’s play for the Dodgers is being handled by media banker Steve Greenberg, former deputy commissioner of baseball (to Fay Vincent, the man Bud Selig ousted) and the son of 1940s baseball legend Hank Greenberg. (Cohen, through his spokesman, declined to comment.) Days before lobbing in his offer, Cohen joined the board of L.A.’s Museum of Contemporary Art and recruited superagent Arn Tellem as a partner. Tellem landed big contracts for Laker stars Kobe Bryant and Pau Gasol, and was an inspiration for the title character of the HBO comedy Arli$$. Cohen has retained Populous, the sports architecture firm that helped design the new Yankee Stadium, to study enhancements to Dodger Stadium. Los Angeles philanthropist Eli Broad and record mogul David Geffen have publicly endorsed the Cohen-Tellem bid. They are, respectively, L.A.’s second- and fourth-richest men.Despite plunging attendance, the Dodgers and Blackstone boast that the team managed to break even in 2011. They emphasize that the Dodgers made the playoffs four times under McCourt, even with a payroll smaller than those of the Yankees and Red Sox. While management underscores such improvements as redone dugouts and new seats, four bidder representatives told Bloomberg Businessweek that they would probably have to spend as much as $450 million over the next few years to boost payroll, upgrade Dodger Stadium, and improve infrastructure around the facility. By way of comparison, Shea Stadium, the former home of the New York Mets, opened two years after Dodger Stadium and was razed in 2008. Blackstone is conducting management presentations during the first week of February, a process bidders hope will make the team’s capital needs and revenue capabilities clearer.One thing they are sure to ask about: parking. In the bid book sent to prospective buyers, the Dodgers parking lots are not listed as part of the sale. Parking is McCourt’s true business, and he currently charges the Dodgers $14 million in rent a year for playing baseball on his land. “Here’s the test to see if we get a smart or stupid owner,” Bob Daly, the former managing partner of the Dodgers from 1999 to 2003, told the Los Angeles Times on Jan. 25. “If you make a deal and allow McCourt to keep the land and parking lots, you are out of your mind.”If Blackstone’s presentations at Chavez Ravine and Magic Johnson’s offices in Beverly Hills represent two official nerve centers of the Dodgers bidding frenzy, the two blocks separating Nate ’n Al, a delicatessen where Joe Torre often drinks his morning cup, and the Grill On The Alley, near Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, form an unofficial third. On a recent morning, real estate developer Stanley Stalford Jr. invited a reporter to his table at the Grill On The Alley to explain why he’d paid to have exactly 1,000 signs posted from Orange County up through the San Fernando Valley urging shoppers and motorists to “Own the Dodgers!”Stalford, 48, with thick salt-and-pepper hair, was dressed in a prep sweater and grew animated as he talked. He says it has long been his dream to become president of the Dodgers en route to getting elected mayor of L.A. For bona fides, he ticked off the four Dodger World Series he attended. “You name it, I was there,” he said. “But today’s Dodgers exemplify everything that went wrong in the last decade: easy money, greed, bad governance.” He shakes his head. “And now you have the very guy behind that era handpicking the owner for the next era?”Even though Stalford is wealthy enough to be known as rich in L.A., he is not angling to become a late-inning bidder. He’s more of a gadfly for John Q. Ticketholder. What if, he wonders aloud, the next owner defaults as well? Or there’s a mutiny among the new partners? How can baseball risk losing the Dodgers twice? Stalford’s solution: sell shares to fans to help raise a minority interest. It’s worked in Cleveland (with baseball’s Indians), and spectacularly in Green Bay, where the community shares ownership of the Packers. Stalford envisions the next owner selling this minority stake in the Dodgers through an initial public offering of shares, with no minimum purchase (ideal for that dad looking for the perfect bar mitzvah present). The proceeds of the offering, he explains, could then be used to discharge some of the debt that will inevitably have to be taken on to finance the deal. Stalford’s pitch comes down to this: “If you’re going to sell your soul, why not to the dyed-in-the-wool Dodgers fan?”— Additional reporting by Steven Church in Wilmington, Del.— With assistance by Scott Soshnick'),\n",

       "  'You may be working for the Chinese sooner than you imagine. Not only is the U.S. severely indebted to the People’s Republic, some projections say Chinese investment in U.S. companies could reach $2 trillion in the coming decade. To help you prepare, we assembled a panel of experts to explain the cultural differences and Confucian principles that coud get an uninformed American office worker into trouble.\\n \\nGreetings\\nReach for your boss’s hand first. “A high-ranking person in the company should never, ever initiate a handshake,” says Brian Su, CEO of Artisan Business Group, a global market consulting firm. A limp grip connotes humility and respect. “Most Chinese think of handshakes as excessive touching,” says etiquette expert Lyudmila Bloch. She suggests a light bow, but there’s no need to kowtow.\\n \\nBusiness Cards\\nRemember business cards? The Chinese still use them. “Make sure it is professionally done. Otherwise, it will be a disaster,” says Peter Hemming, the founder of China Insight. When receiving a card from a Chinese businessperson, make sure to be impressed by it. Once you’ve finished introductions, place the card on the table in front of you, where you can continue to admire it.\\n \\nGifts\\nNo clocks, says Maria Gu, a business coach from Shanghai. The pronunciation of sòngzhōng (“to give clocks”) could also mean “to attend on a dying relative.” A watch is much better, unless it’s fancy. Too much bling is considered garish and embarrassing. “The Chinese enjoy gifts with Western-branded names,” says Bloch. “Like a Mickey Mouse watch.” Seriously? “Yes, a watch from Walt Disney would be very appreciated.”\\n \\nNumbers\\n“Numbers can be auspicious or inauspicious,” says Tao Yue, managing director of China Cultural Consultancy. The number four, say, is a homonym for “death” in Chinese. If you’re on a building’s fourth floor, don’t expect many pop-ins from your boss. Numbers like six and three are much more fortuitous. By far the most coveted number is eight, which sounds like the word for “wealth.”\\n \\nFood\\nBe ready to eat your weight in offal. Su recalls a recent business meal in China that consisted of raw pig groin and “kinda chewy” donkey’s penis. But don’t scarf down whatever’s placed in front of you. Fish heads should be reserved for the most important person at the table; the Chinese word for “head” also means “leader.”\\n \\nHand Gestures\\nWatch your fingers. “Pointing with one finger, the ‘hey you, come here’ finger, that is very, very rude,” says Bloch. To get somebody’s attention in the office, she suggests gesturing at them with your entire hand. Like a martial arts chop? “Well, no, not exactly like that,” she clarifies. “It’s more of a graceful gesture.” Like you’re an orchestra conductor? “If that helps, sure.” You may be working for the Chinese sooner than you imagine. Not only is the U.S. severely indebted to the People’s Republic, some projections say Chinese investment in U.S. companies could reach $2 trillion in the coming decade. To help you prepare, we assembled a panel of experts to explain the cultural differences and Confucian principles that could get an uninformed American office worker into trouble.\\n \\nSmoking and Drinking\\nIf you want your boss to respect you, channel your inner Don Draper. “Smoking is still a big icebreaker for Chinese businessmen,” says Su; cigarettes are exchanged like business cards (see above). And then there’s the liquor. “If you say you can’t drink alcohol because of health reasons, and yet you … look perfectly healthy, they’ll force you to drink anyway,” laughs Su. “They’ll say, ‘Drink so we can talk business!’”\\n \\nFeng Shui\\nThe age-old system of geomancy has “become a big deal over the last 10 or 15 years,” says Shanghai native Tao. Does that mean you should follow the lead of the Repulse Bay apartment complex in Hong Kong, which features a large hole to accommodate the dragon that supposedly lives in a nearby mountain? “I would totally forget a dragon hole in an American building,” advises Hemming. “Not many dragons in the United States.”'),\n",

       "  'Among the 80 or so customers crammed into Bare Escentuals, it’s easy to spot Leslie Blodgett. It’s not merely her six-inch platform heels and bright magenta-and-blue dress that set her apart in the Thousand Oaks (Calif.) mall boutique, but her confidence. To the woman concerned she’s too old for shimmery eye shadow, Blodgett swoops in and encourages her to wear whatever she wants. With a deft sweep of a brush, she demonstrates a new shade of blush on another customer’s cheek. And when she isn’t helping anyone, she pivots on her heels for admirers gushing about her dress, made by the breakout designer Erdem.Blodgett, 49, has spent the past 18 years nurturing Bare Escentuals from a startup into a global cosmetics empire. She sold the company for $1.7 billion to Shiseido in March 2010 but still pitches products in stores around the world and chats incessantly with customers online. Scores of fans post daily messages on Blodgett’s Facebook page, confessing details about their personal lives and offering opinions on her additive-free makeup. She only wishes her 19-year-old son, Trent, were in touch with her as frequently as he is with her husband, Keith. In 1995, at 38, Keith quit making television commercials to raise Trent, freeing up Leslie to build her business. She’d do it all again, but she’s jealous of her husband’s relationship with her son. Trent, a college sophomore, texts his father almost every day; he often goes a week without texting her.“Once I knew my role was providing for the family, I took that very seriously. But there was envy knowing I wasn’t there for our son during the day,” says Blodgett. “Keith does everything at home—the cooking, repairs, finances, vacation planning—and I could work long hours and travel a lot, knowing he took such good care of Trent. I love my work, but I would have liked to have a little more balance or even understand what that means.”Blodgett’s lament is becoming more familiar as a generation of female breadwinners look back on the sacrifices—some little, some profound—required to have the careers they wanted. Like hundreds of thousands of women who have advanced into management roles in the past two decades—and, in particular, the hundreds who’ve become senior corporate officers—she figured out early what every man with a corner office has long known: To make it to the top, you need a wife. If that wife happens to be a husband, and increasingly it is, so be it.When Carly Fiorina became Hewlett-Packard’s first female chief executive officer, the existence of her househusband, Frank Fiorina, who had retired early from AT&T to support her career, was a mini-sensation; now this arrangement isn’t at all unusual. Seven of the 18 women who are currently CEOs of Fortune 500 companies—including Xerox’s Ursula Burns, PepsiCo’s Indra Nooyi, and WellPoint’s Angela Braly—have, or at some point have had, a stay-at-home husband. So do scores of female CEOs of smaller companies and women in other senior executive jobs. Others, like IBM’s new CEO, Ginni Rometty, have spouses who dialed back their careers to become their powerful wives’ chief domestic officers.This role reversal is occurring more and more as women edge past men at work. Women now fill a majority of jobs in the U.S., including 51.4 percent of managerial and professional positions, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. Some 23 percent of wives now out-earn their husbands, according to a 2010 study by the Pew Research Center. And this earnings trend is more dramatic among younger people. Women 30 and under make more money, on average, than their male counterparts in all but three of the largest cities in the U.S.During the recent recession, three men lost their jobs for every woman. Many unemployed fathers, casualties of layoffs in manufacturing and finance, have ended up caring for their children full-time while their wives are the primary wage earners. The number of men in the U.S. who regularly care for children under age five increased to 32 percent in 2010 from 19 percent in 1988, according to Census figures. Among those fathers with preschool-age children, one in five served as the main caregiver.Even as the trend becomes more widespread, stigmas persist. At-home dads are sometimes perceived as freeloaders, even if they’ve lost jobs. Or they’re considered frivolous kept men—gentlemen who golf. The househusbands of highly successful women, after all, live in luxurious homes, take nice vacations, and can afford nannies and housekeepers, which many employ at least part-time. In reaction, at-home dads have launched a spate of support groups and daddy blogs to defend themselves.“Men are suddenly seeing what it’s been like for women throughout history,” says Linda R. Hirshman, a lawyer and the author of Get to Work, a book that challenges at-home moms to secure paying jobs and insist that their husbands do at least half the housework. Caring for children all day and doing housework is tiring, unappreciated work that few are cut out for—and it leaves men and women alike feeling isolated and diminished.There’s some good news about the at-home dads trend. “By going against the grain, men get to stretch their parenting abilities and women can advance,” notes Stephanie Coontz, a family studies professor at Evergreen State College in Olympia, Wash., and author of Marriage: a History. And yet the trend underscores something else: When jobs are scarce or one partner is aiming high, a two-career partnership is next to impossible. “Top power jobs are so time-consuming and difficult, you can’t have two spouses doing them and maintain a marriage and family,” says Coontz. This explains why, even as women make up more of the workforce, they’re still a small minority (14 percent, according to New York-based Catalyst) in senior executive jobs. When they reach the always-on, all-consuming executive level, “it’s still women who more often put family ahead of their careers,” says Ken Matos, a senior director at Families and Work Institute in New York. It may explain, too, why bookstore shelves and e-book catalogs are jammed with self-help books for ambitious women, of which I’d Rather Be in Charge, by former Ogilvy-Mather Worldwide CEO Charlotte Beers, is merely the latest. Some, such as Hirshman’s top-selling Get to Work, recommend that women “marry down”—find husbands who won’t mind staying at home—or wed older men who are ready to retire as their careers take off. What’s indisputable is that couples increasingly are negotiating whose career will take precedence before they start a family.“Your wife’s career is about to soar, and you need to get out of her way.” That’s what Ken Gladden says his boss told him shortly before his wife, Dawn Lepore, was named the first female CIO at Charles Schwab in 1994. He was a vice-president at Schwab in computer systems. Lepore’s promotion meant she’d become his top boss. “I married above my station,” Gladden jokes.Gladden moved to a job at Visa. When their son, Andrew, was born four years later in 1998, Gladden quit working altogether. He and Lepore had tried for years to have a child and didn’t want him raised by a nanny. Being a full-time dad wasn’t the biggest adjustment Gladden made for Lepore’s career. That came later, when Seattle-based drugstore.com recruited Lepore to become its CEO in 2004.Gladden had lived in the San Francisco Bay Area for 25 years and wasn’t keen to move to a city where it rains a lot and he didn’t know anyone. He rejected Lepore’s suggestion that she commute between Seattle and San Francisco, and after some long discussions he agreed to relocate—on the condition that they kept their Bay Area home. They still return for holidays and some vacations. “To do what I’m doing, you’ve got to be able to say ‘my wife’s the breadwinner, the more powerful one,’ and be O.K. with that. But you also need your own interests,” says Gladden, who has used his computing skills to launch a home-based business developing software for schools.The couple’s five-bedroom Seattle home overlooks Lake Washington. Gladden, 63, is chief administrator of it and their children, who now are 9 and 13. While they’re in school, he works on his software. From 3 p.m. until bedtime, he carpools to and from sports and music lessons, warms up dinners prepared by a part-time housekeeper, and supervises homework. Lepore, 57, is often out of town. She oversaw the sale of drugstore.com to Walgreens last year, for $429 million. As CEO, she was rarely home before 8 or 9 p.m. and traveled several days a week. Now, as a consultant to several startups and a director at EBay, she still travels frequently. If Gladden envies anything, it’s the ease with which his wife can walk into a room filled with well-known executives like Bill Gates and “go right up to them and start talking. I don’t feel like I can participate,” he says.Lepore wishes her “biggest supporter” would get more recognition for everything he does at home. When an executive recently told her “having an at-home husband makes it easy for you to be a CEO,” she responded, “no, not easy. He makes it possible.” Lepore advises younger women to “choose your spouse carefully. If you want a top job, you need a husband who isn’t self-involved and will support your success,” even if you go further than him. There are tradeoffs, she warns: “I’ve missed so much with my kids—school plays, recitals, just seeing them every day.”For Lepore and Gladden, the role reversal paid off, and, as one of the few couples willing to go public about their domestic arrangement, they’re a rare source of inspiration for those who are still figuring it out. Like Gladden, Matt Schneider, 36, is an at-home dad. A former technology company manager and then a sixth grade teacher, he cares for his sons Max and Sam, 6 and 3, while his wife, Priyanka, also 36, puts in 10-hour days as chief operating officer at a Manhattan real estate management startup. He feels “privileged,” he says, to be with his sons full-time “and see them change every day,” while allowing that child care and housework can be mind-numbing. He uses every minute of the 2½ hours each weekday when Sam is in preschool to expand the NYC DADS Group he co-founded, 450 members strong. Members meet for play dates with their kids, discuss parenting, and stand up for at-home dads. “We’re still portrayed as bumbling idiots,” Schneider says. He rails against a prejudice that moms would do a better job—if only they were there. “Everyone is learning from scratch how to change diapers and toilet-train,” he says, “and there’s no reason to think this is woman’s work.”Schneider and his wife, who met as undergraduates at University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business, decided before they wed that she’d have the big career and he’d be the primary parent. “It’s her name on the paycheck, and sure, we’ve thought about the precariousness of having just one breadwinner. But she wouldn’t earn what she does if I wasn’t doing what I do,” he says. Which is not to say that he doesn’t wonder “whether I can get back to a career when I want to and build on what I’ve done before.”At-home moms have snubbed him at arts and crafts classes and on playgrounds. “Men, even those of us pushing strollers, are perceived as dangerous,” Schneider says. He was rejected when he wanted to join an at-home neighborhood moms’ group, which prompted him to blog more about the similarities among moms and dads. “I’ve met moms and dads who are happy to give a screaming kid a candy bar to get him to settle down, and moms and dads who show up at play dates with containers filled with organic fruit,” he says. “The differences aren’t gender-specific.”It’s no different for gay couples. Brad Kleinerman and Flint Gehre have taken turns being at-home dads for their three sons, now 19, 18, and 10. When their sons—biological siblings they adopted through the Los Angeles County foster care system—were young, Kleinerman and Gehre relied first on a weekday nanny and then a live-in one while both worked full-time. Kleinerman, 50, was an executive in human resources at Walt Disney and NASA. Gehre, 46, was a teacher and then director of global learning and communications at Disney. Five years ago, they decided they no longer wanted to outsource parenting. “We always wanted to have dinner together as a family, but by the time we got home, the nanny had fed our kids,” says Gehre. “Our kids were at pivotal ages—the two oldest about to go to high school and the youngest to first grade. We wanted to be the ones instilling our values and be there when they needed help with homework or had to get to a doctor.”In 2007 the couple moved from Los Angeles to Avon, Conn., where they were able to get married legally and find better schools for their kids. Kleinerman became the full-time dad and Gehre kept his Disney job, working partly from home and traveling frequently to Los Angeles. A year later they switched: Gehre quit Disney to parent full-time and Kleinerman found a new job as a human resources director at Cigna Healthcare. Gehre says he’s never felt discriminated against as a gay dad or a stay-at-home dad. “No one has ever said to me, ‘Why would you stay home with the kids?’ Where we’re discriminated is when we pay taxes. We don’t qualify for the marriage deduction, we have to file as single people,” he says. If he has one regret about being at home, it’s the lack of adult conversation and stimulation: “I worked in a very high-intensity atmosphere with very intelligent and hard-driving people, and that keeps you sharp.” Any dullness doesn’t make Gehre doubt his decision. Having consciously chosen to have a family, he and Kleinerman felt they had not only to provide the essentials, but also to be present.Is there an alternate universe where both parents can pursue careers without outsourcing child care? The five Nordic countries—Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Denmark—are noted leaders in keeping moms, in particular, on the job. “These countries have made it possible to have a better division of labor both at work and at home through policies that both encourage the participation of women in the labor force and men in their families,” says Saadia Zahidi, co-author of the World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap Report. The policies Zahidi refers to include mandatory paternal leave in combination with maternity leave; generous, federally mandated parental leave benefits; gender-neutral tax incentives; and post-maternity reentry programs.There were no such programs or precedents for Jennifer Granholm and Dan Mulhern. When the two met at Harvard Law School, she grilled him about what he expected from a wife. Mulhern accepted that Granholm would never be a homemaker like his mother, but he never expected her to run for political office. “When I was young,” he says, “I thought I’d be the governor”—not married to the governor. Granholm was governor of Michigan from 2003 through 2010, and her election forced Mulhern to walk away from the Detroit-based consulting business he founded, which had numerous contracts with state-licensed health insurance companies, municipalities, and school districts. Once that happened, he felt “in a backroom somewhere” and in a marriage that was “a lot more give than take.”Mulhern understood that his wife faced “extraordinary pressure” during her two terms, including a $1.7 billion budget deficit and the bankruptcies of General Motors and Chrysler. She had limited time for their three children, who were 6, 11, and 14 when she was elected, and even less for him. “I didn’t want to say, ‘hey, you missed my birthday’ or ‘you haven’t even noticed what happened with the kids,’ but I sometimes felt resentful,” he says.Mulhern says he complained to his wife that they spent 95 percent of the little time they had together talking about her work. He missed the attention she used to give him but felt humiliated asking for it. He gradually changed his expectations. He stopped waiting for Granholm to call him in the middle of the day to share what had happened at meetings they’d spent time talking about the prior evening. And he realized he couldn’t recreate for her all the memorable or awkward moments he had with their children—like the time he found his daughter and her high school friends in the outdoor shower, “ostensibly with their clothes on. I had to call all the parents and tell them, as a courtesy, ‘I want you to know this happened at the Governor’s mansion,’ ” he says. “While my wife was battling the Republican head of the State Senate, I had a teenage daughter who was a more formidable opponent.”When Granholm left office and was asked “what’s next?,” she said, “it’s Dan’s turn.” As a former governor, though, she’s the one with more obvious opportunities. Later this month, Granholm launches a daily political commentary show on Current TV. She’s also teaching at the University of California at Berkeley, where Dan has a part-time gig thanks to his wife.“The employment opportunities that come my way—and my salary potential—aren’t what my wife’s are now,” says Mulhern. He plans to continue to teach, write, and do some consulting, while also taking care of their 14-year-old son. “Someone has to be focused on him every day,” he says.The experiences and reflections of powerful women and their at-home husbands could lead to changes at work so that neither women nor men have to sacrifice their careers or families. “There’s no reason women should feel guilty about achieving great success, but there should be a way for success to include professional and personal happiness for everyone,” says Get to Work author Hirshman. “If you have to kill yourself at work, that’s bad for everyone.”Kathleen Christensen agrees. As program director at the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, she has focused on work and family issues and says we’re back to the 1950s, only “instead of Jane at home, it’s John. But it’s still one person doing 100 percent of work outside the home and the other doing 100 percent at home.” Just as we saw the Feminine Mystique in the 1960s among frustrated housewives, Christensen predicts, “we may see the Masculine Mystique in 2020.”The children of couples who have reversed roles know the stakes better than anyone. One morning last year, when Dawn Lepore was packing for a business trip to New York, her nine-year-old daughter burst into tears. “I don’t want you to travel so much,” Elizabeth told her mother. Lepore hugged her, called her school, and said her daughter would be staying home that morning. Then she rescheduled her flight until much later that day. “There have been times when what Elizabeth wants most is a mom who stays home and bakes cookies,” she says.Lepore is sometimes concerned that her children won’t be ambitious because they’ve often heard her complain about how exhausted she is after work. But they’re much closer to their father than kids whose dads work full-time, and they have a different perspective about men’s and women’s potential. When a friend of her daughter’s said that fathers go to offices every day, Lepore recalls, “Elizabeth replied, ‘Don’t be silly, dads are at home.’ ”'),\n",

       "  'Less than two years after the worker suicides at electronics giant Foxconn and a strike at Honda suppliers in Guangdong province, labor troubles are again roiling China. On Nov. 17 around 7,000 workers at a Taiwanese-owned New Balance supplier in Dongguan protested plans to relocate production to Jiangxi province and cut bonuses. Dozens of workers were injured when police moved in, according to reports and photos posted on the Internet. Five days later, 1,000 workers halted production to protest overtime rules at a Shenzhen company that, according to its website, supplies Hewlett-Packard. In Shanghai, women workers at Singapore-owned Hi-P International, a supplier for Motorola Mobility and others, struck on Nov. 30 over a planned shift of part of production to Jiangsu province. (Motorola confirms the incident, and says it is not directly involved in working toward a resolution.) “We are seeing an upsurge in worker activism that exceeds anything since the summer of 2010,” says Geoffrey Crothall, communications director at China Labour Bulletin, an advocacy group in Hong Kong. Some 180,000 riots, strikes, and protests occurred in 2010, according to Sun Liping, a professor at Beijing’s Tsinghua University.On Dec. 1 the government announced the first contraction in manufacturing since 2009. “As the environment goes from bad to worse, a lot of factories want to find a way out,” says Willie Fung, chairman of Hong Kong bra-maker Top Form International. “They want to downsize, shut down, or move somewhere else, and this sparks labor disputes.” A strike at Fung’s Shenzhen factory ended after he agreed to a holiday bonus of $189 each for 500 workers.China’s leaders don’t want strikes to stoke broad social unrest. That could be tricky, because the new generation is ready to assert itself. The young are less tolerant of long hours and assembly line jobs and more prone to job hopping, says Christian Ewert, president and CEO of New York-based International Council of Toy Industries CARE Foundation, which monitors working conditions and whose members include Walt Disney, Mattel, and Lego.In Shenzhen, Philips, HP, and Dell are working with a Dutch government-supported program to improve labor conditions while raising productivity. As “labor tightens in China, the industry needs to pay more attention to the worker,” says Sonny Kwok, a Philips senior vice-president. Consultant Infact Global Partners, hired to run the initiative, is designing training programs at 100 factories employing 500,000. Infact plans to interview departing workers to find out why they change jobs so often, and get supervisors to assess themselves, says Managing Director Ian Spaulding. “In an environment where you have 10 to 20 percent turnover a month, managers start to think of workers as machines. That creates resentment on both sides.”Ewert’s group earlier this year launched a pilot program to teach labor law to workers and middle-level managers at factories that supply overseas corporations. These local companies have codes imposed on them by the multinationals about paying overtime properly, how many can sleep in a dorm, even how much meat the cafeteria serves.The group’s “edutainment” videos have a Smurf-like figure who introduces dramas with real workers as the actors. In one segment, a line worker confronts a manager for holding a meeting in a noisy factory. Later a guard stops the protagonist for not having a badge, leaving him seething. His pretty girlfriend and her pal, who also work at the plant, persuade him to check the regulations on the bulletin board. The manager he had berated proves a friendly advocate who takes him to human resources to plead his case: happy ending. “With a good worker-management relationship, factories can be just like home!” says the blue narrator.These programs have their skeptics. Speaking of Infact’s efforts, Chang Kai, a professor of labor relations at Renmin University of China in Beijing, says that helping workers negotiate more effectively is a sensitive issue for the government, which fears such attempts could empower workers too much. Adds Bob Bainbridge, who until early 2011 worked for Apple policing suppliers for worker abuses, “Many times you will find some senior management that want to do the right things. But mid-level management and line managers resort back to more dictatorial ways.”The government is expanding the Party-controlled official union—still a largely toothless organization, according to Chang Kai. Wal-Mart, Dell, and Motorola have already let the union in. Policymakers want 80 percent of all companies to have collective bargaining agreements by 2013. “We want to guide the expectations of our migrant workers,” says Yang Hongshan, deputy director general of the human resources and social security department of Guangdong province. The official union is training tens of thousands of negotiators to help workers bargain over wages.The only sure strategy to stop strikes may be to raise pay. The latest Five-Year Plan aims to increase the average minimum wage by at least 13 percent a year. Or machines can replace workers. After Hong Kong’s Milo’s Knitwear (International) added new Japanese knitting machines at its Dongguan sweater factory, it reduced line workers from 80 to 6. “All the headaches, the riots—gone,” says Managing Director Willy Lin. “Machines don’t complain about their salaries.”— With assistance by Bruce EinhornThe bottom line: China’s government wants almost all companies negotiating collective wage agreements with workers by 2013.'),\n",

       "  '2011-12-15',\n",
       "  'In a hotel conference room in Portland, Ore., in early December, four representatives of the Pacific-12 Conference, including Commissioner Larry Scott, 47, sit at a square table with five creative directors from Imaginary Forces, a Los Angeles advertising studio. They are trying to come up with the look and feel of the Pac-12 Network, a 24-hour cable enterprise launching in August 2012 that will be devoted exclusively to Pac-12 sports. Peter Frankfurt, the creative director of Imaginary Forces, is narrating as an associate clicks through a series of gleaming computer-generated graphics in silver, white, and blue. “The word we are thinking about is, ‘connection,’ ” Frankfurt says. “We are dealing with 12 schools, so there is this connection.”Scott leans back in a wire mesh chair and holds a pen up near his ear so that it vibrates like an antenna. Scott is six-foot-three, with a broad, sloping forehead and diamond-shaped eyes. It is hard to read his reaction to the presentation. The rest of his team, including Gary Stevenson, president of Pac-12 Enterprises, the division that oversees the network, and Marketing Director Danette Leighton, look unimpressed. Scott nods, then sits forward.“I was thinking about ‘ownable,’ ” he says. The Imaginary Forces team all scribble the world “ownable.” “I was thinking this can’t be something the Big Ten or the SEC would do. This has to be ours. Something only we could do.”“But without being too busy,” says Stevenson.“And without losing the history and tradition,” says Leighton.“And futuristic, cutting-edge,” adds Scott.“But don’t lose the simple,” says Stevenson.As the meeting goes on, it becomes clear that the Pac-12 Conference, like college sports as a whole, is changing so rapidly and profoundly that even the people in charge are struggling to describe what it has become. In the two years since Scott took over as commissioner of the conference formerly known as the Pac-10—which includes some of the most prestigious research universities on the West Coast—it has added two new members, the first additions since 1978; negotiated the largest television rights package in college football history, $3 billion over 12 years; and begun the process of building a seven-channel television network. In so doing, Scott has emerged as the pivotal player driving an unprecedented geographic and financial transformation of college athletics.Last summer, Scott launched a bid to turn the Pac-10 into a 16-school superconference stretching from California to Texas. Although Scott’s push failed after the University of Texas at Austin refused to accept his terms, it set off a dizzying realignment of the conference landscape. The Big Ten is now twelve, the Big 12 has lost three teams but added two, and the Big East Conference has expanded its geographical footprint to include the entire continental U.S. The impetus for this mad scramble is the desire of university presidents and athletic directors to grab a share of the swelling television revenue that comes with major-conference college football, which generated a record $2.8 billion in 2010, according to the Sport Business Research Network, making it the second-most-popular televised sport in America after professional football.It’s debatable whether all that money is benefiting or subverting the mission of U.S. universities. The scandal at Pennsylvania State University, in which administrators allegedly covered up reports of child sex-abuse to protect a revered coach, is the most damning example of the outsize influence of football programs in higher education. Many fans question whether the sport has grown too powerful.Scott, who makes $1.5 million a year, not including incentive-based bonuses, rejects that view. He says his role is to optimize what the schools in the Pac-12 make through big-ticket sports such as football and basketball, so they can spend it in classrooms and laboratories. “The more money we bring in, the more these universities can do academically, [and] they can better fund the non-revenue sports,” he says. “This isn’t just about football.”He goes on to say these are the first steps in the long, messy march toward what he sees as inevitable: a single football conference consisting of as many as 72 teams, possessing as much negotiating leverage and commercial potential as the National Football League. “The market right now is inefficient. We have too many sellers and limited buyers. Imagine the kind of value we could unleash if there were only one seller. All six power conferences negotiating one deal. That’s where this is going.” \\nThe Pacific Coast Conference, as the Pac-12 was called when it was founded with four teams in 1915, is the second-oldest conference in college sports—only the Big Ten predates it. From the start it combined first-rate academics with excellent athletics: Its teams have won 444 non-football championships, more than any other conference, and 24 national football championships.Yet over the last decade the conference’s profile declined. The Southeastern Conference, in 2009, and the Big Ten, in 2007, had both signed multibillion-dollar television deals that gave their schools regular national exposure, and even the Atlantic Coast Conference and Big 12 were getting their games into better national time slots. The Big Ten, in partnership with Fox Entertainment Group, had launched its own national TV network that generated $225 million in 2010. By 2009 the Pac-10 was fifth among the six major football conferences in revenue, taking in just $109 million, less than half what the SEC earned.“You didn’t need to be a rocket scientist to know we weren’t doing well in terms of media contracts,” says Edward J. Ray, president of Oregon State University. “At the time we were slated to get about $60 million a year for media rights. The outside consultants were saying we should get at least double that. We knew we needed someone who was pretty media-savvy.”When former Pac-10 President Thomas C. Hansen retired in 2009, the 10 university presidents and chancellors, who serve as the board of directors of the conference, all believed that what the conference needed was an executive who was better versed in negotiating television contracts, licensing fees, and marketing. “There was a feeling we were not being projected at the level we wanted to be projected at,” says Michael M. Crow, president of Arizona State University. “We needed someone a little more visionary.”Larry Scott grew up on Long Island, the oldest of three siblings in an avid tennis-playing family. Scott went to Harvard University, where he was captain of the tennis team and a European history major. As a player, “Larry was smart,” says Harvard teammate Peter Palandjian. “There are a lot of ways to kill a person on the court, and Larry has this ability to figure out how to uncork someone, to find where their game is vulnerable.”After graduation, Scott joined the Association of Tennis Professionals tour. He would never rank higher than 210th in the world and won only one main draw match, though that was at Wimbledon. “I never had a master plan for tennis,” Scott says. “I was just focused on getting to the next level and ended up playing professionally.”Scott retired from professional tennis in his mid-20s and went to work for the ATP as an executive vice-president based in Australia, where he negotiated television and sponsorship deals from North Africa to Latin America. In this job and his next, as chief marketing officer for the ATP in London, he wrestled with the sport’s fragmentation. Each Grand Slam tournament cut its own TV deal, a situation that Scott felt was slicing up the product and driving down demand. “Fragmentation of rights is a value killer. Centralization of rights is a value driver,” Scott says.In 2003 he became chairman and chief executive officer of the Women’s Tennis Assn. The WTA, Scott says, “had an image that the players were divas. Players were pulling out of tournaments, and they weren’t committed to supporting the sponsors.” He focused on two goals: securing for the women equal prize money in Grand Slam tournaments and building relationships with sponsors to give the sport some financial stability. By fighting for equal prize money, Scott was able to earn the loyalties of top female players. That made them more receptive to his appeals that they increase their tournament participation and availability, a precondition to securing larger sponsorship money. “Larry is a very good salesman,” says Billie Jean King, the founder of the women’s tour. “He has this way of listening, and then taking that information and going away and coming back and saying that same thing back to them. That way the stakeholders feel like they got what they want.”In 2004, Scott negotiated an $88 million deal with Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications, the largest-ever sponsorship arrangement in professional tennis. He had also signed the richest television deal in WTA history, increasing overall revenue from $21 million in 2003 to $54 million in 2009. Soon the men’s tour approached Scott about becoming its new CEO. During his interviews with the ATP board in New York, he said he would take the job only if he could merge the men’s and women’s tours, centralizing television and sponsorship rights to drive better deals.Sitting in the room was a corporate headhunter, Jed Hughes of Spencer Stuart. Hughes called Scott the next morning to tell him the ATP was not interested in a merger. Would he perhaps consider another position Hughes was looking to fill, at a college athletic conference out west?“My first thought was, ‘What a sleazy headhunter, trying to sell me another job,’ ” Scott says, jokingly. “I told him I would think about it.” \\nScott’s first act upon taking the helm at the Pac-10 was to travel to all 10 member schools, talking to the university presidents, athletic directors, coaches, and students to get a sense of what Scott calls “conference values.” At a meeting in October 2009, he gave a PowerPoint presentation that laid out the Pac-10’s dire situation—the second-to-last-place revenue figures, the poor national TV coverage, the “regressive” brand image. He said he believed that the gap between the Pac-10 and the SEC and Big Ten would only widen if drastic measures weren’t taken. “This conference didn’t look at itself as a league, they looked at themselves as this sort of governing body that was responsible for rulemaking,” Scott says. Marketing, advertising, even negotiating with TV partners had been outsourced or handled by the individual institutions themselves. “This was a conference that was very resistant to change,” he says.Scott recognized the conference’s potential. These were successful academic institutions with gigantic fan bases and top-tier athletic programs. He believed the conference’s TV rights, which were due to be renegotiated in 2011, presented an opportunity not only to close the gap with the other power conferences but potentially to pass them. His three-step plan included evaluating expansion, renegotiating TV contracts, and starting a cable network devoted solely to conference sports. Richard W. Lariviere, president of the University of Oregon, describes Scott’s influence on the conference in almost emotional terms. “It was this unleashing of all our hunger for change, for innovation,” he says. “Larry came in and we talked for 10 minutes, and I got exactly where we were going.”Scott knew that when it came to a new TV deal, the conference was in a favorable position. The Comcast-NBC merger had created a powerful cable and broadcast entity that would be eager for sports programming and would bid against Walt Disney, owner of ABC and ESPN, and News Corp., owner of Fox Sports. The other major athletic conferences were effectively locked up for five years, making the Pac-10 the last major conference with both broadcast and cable rights for sale.To unlock the value, Scott needed both to expand and to centralize. So began the whirlwind flying around the country in a borrowed private jet, from Austin, Tex., to Norman, Okla., to Boulder, Colo., as Scott attempted to assemble a superconference with a TV footprint of 75 million homes. Scott says it was no secret the conference thought the University of Texas was a good fit for the Pac-10, academically and athletically. However, in Scott’s negotiations with UT President Bill Powers, it was clear Texas was not committed to the idea of sharing revenue equally with 15 other schools. UT wanted to maintain the new Longhorn Network, all of whose profits flow to Texas. “I had a vision of a league-based, centralized brand, and Texas wanted to do their own thing,” Scott says. “It was about control. In the short term, Texas is successful enough that it might work going it alone. But in the long run, I don’t think so.” In June 2010, Texas informed Scott it would not join the Pac-10.Without Texas, Scott scaled back his plans. Rather than try to bring in six new schools, the Pac-10 added two, the University of Utah and the University of Colorado. That pulled in the important Denver television market and allowed the conference to split into two divisions, paving the way for a lucrative championship game in football. (NCAA regulations require 12 teams in a conference for a championship game.)Scott still had to persuade USC and UCLA to buy into the concept of equal revenue sharing. The two schools had disproportionately benefited from previous television deals. “The eyeballs are in L.A., and we have those,” says Pat Haden, USC’s athletic director. “In early negotiations, [UCLA Athletic Director] Dan Guerrero and I were insisting on a premium. We started from that basic place.”Over the course of a month, Scott worked to persuade the Los Angeles schools to agree to split revenue equally with 10 other schools. Haden and Guerrero said that if Scott could deliver a package worth $175 million per year, they would triple their current TV revenue, in which case they could live with revenue sharing. With the blessing of the L.A. schools, Scott was able to sell the most lucrative television package in college sports history: $3 billion for 12 years to ESPN and Fox, which combined to make the deal in order to keep Comcast-NBC out of the college football business. In the first year the Pac-12 will take in about $180 million from the ESPN-Fox deal and at least $100 million from other sources, making it the richest conference in sports.The deal reserved plenty of premium programming—namely, high-profile football and basketball games—for a future Pac-12 network. “You gotta have tonnage if you are starting your own network,” says Chris Bevilacqua, a sports media consultant and co-founder of the College Sports Television network, who worked closely with Scott. “The Pac-12 had 80 games of football inventory, and we’re only selling 40 [to the networks]. We held back a lot of high-quality content.”No conference has ever owned and operated its own television network. (The Big Ten Network was launched in partnership with Fox, which owned 49 percent of it.) Scott’s team is responsible for everything from finding studios and facilities to packaging some Pac-12 sports—college fencing, anyone?—that may never have been televised before. “We’re going to have 850 live events a year,” says Gary Stevenson. “Now we have to figure out how to do that.” Although enthusiastic about owning their own network, the conference’s school presidents declined to give Scott the money to launch it. Instead, Scott has raised startup capital by preselling the rights to cable carriers throughout the West: Comcast, Time Warner, Cox Communications, and Bright House Networks agreed to $65 million in annual subscription fees. There will be millions more when the conference negotiates its satellite deals with DirecTV or Dish Network.Scott jokes that the Pac-12 network build-out should be called the “Pac-12 stimulus program,” as the conference plans to increase head count by 150 and build a 70,000-square-foot headquarters and broadcast studio in San Francisco. Once it goes live next year, the network should immediately have a valuation, according to Scott, of about $1 billion. \\nOn a cold December night in Eugene, Ore., Scott is in a luxury suite at Autzen Stadium on the campus of the University of Oregon, waiting for the start of the inaugural Pac-12 championship game, between Oregon and UCLA. Scott, accompanied by his wife, Cybille—they have three children—is in shirtsleeves, eating tri-tip steak and potatoes, served up from silver trays at the back of the suite. Milling about are a few television executives and a half-dozen officials from the Sugar Bowl, the Rose Bowl, and the Holiday Bowl.Scott has been relentlessly upbeat about this game and has said he feels vindicated by his decision to have the team with the better record host it, as opposed to playing it at a neutral site. “An empty stadium looks awful on TV,” he says. He has faced that problem with the conference’s postseason basketball tournament, which has been played at the Staples Center in Los Angeles to less than packed houses; the conference is strongly considering moving the tournament to the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. “People will travel to Las Vegas,” Scott says. He is also eyeing the international market: In mid-December he took a four-day trip to China to explore the possibility of bringing Pac-12 basketball teams over to play against Chinese squads and holding a conference football game in Beijing in 2013.Down the hall from Scott’s box, University of Oregon President Lariviere plays host to a few dozen revelers in a vast green and yellow suite, where a bartender is pouring free drinks and several serving stations are offering up plenty of steak and chicken. These are the spoils, in many ways, of those billions of dollars Scott has made for the conference. If the past few weeks are any indication of things to come, a good chunk of that money will go to pay high-profile coaches: Washington State, Arizona, and UCLA have all lured new football coaches with multiyear, seven-figure contracts.How much bigger can college football get? Scott points out that there are a hundred million households in the U.S. with cable or satellite subscriptions, paying an average of $120 a month. “We are fishing in a $100 billion-a-year pond that is essentially held together by live sports,” says Bevilacqua. “Must-carry programming is largely live sports.”Remember that argument about centralization vs. fragmentation? Scott has proved that centralization unleashes value at the conference level, and in future negotiations other conferences will take note. It is only a matter of time, Scott believes, before it happens throughout college football. The old multiconference structure will eventually collapse, giving rise to a single consortium, made up of America’s biggest football schools, that can negotiate collectively for the richest possible broadcasting deal. If Larry Scott has his way, college football one day will be as lucrative as the professional version, rivaling the $6 billion a year in TV revenue the NFL will make in 2014. Reflecting on what he has already accomplished at the Pac-12, Scott says: “This deal is the benchmark. Until the next one.”'),\n",

       "  'In October, a foreign national named Mike Fikri purchased a one-way plane ticket from Cairo to Miami, where he rented a condo. Over the previous few weeks, he’d made a number of large withdrawals from a Russian bank account and placed repeated calls to a few people in Syria. More recently, he rented a truck, drove to Orlando, and visited Walt Disney World by himself. As numerous security videos indicate, he did not frolic at the happiest place on earth. He spent his day taking pictures of crowded plazas and gate areas.None of Fikri’s individual actions would raise suspicions. Lots of people rent trucks or have relations in Syria, and no doubt there are harmless eccentrics out there fascinated by amusement park infrastructure. Taken together, though, they suggested that Fikri was up to something. And yet, until about four years ago, his pre-attack prep work would have gone unnoticed. A CIA analyst might have flagged the plane ticket purchase; an FBI agent might have seen the bank transfers. But there was nothing to connect the two. Lucky for counterterror agents, not to mention tourists in Orlando, the government now has software made by Palantir Technologies, a Silicon Valley company that’s become the darling of the intelligence and law enforcement communities.The day Fikri drives to Orlando, he gets a speeding ticket, which triggers an alert in the CIA’s Palantir system. An analyst types Fikri’s name into a search box and up pops a wealth of information pulled from every database at the government’s disposal. There’s fingerprint and DNA evidence for Fikri gathered by a CIA operative in Cairo; video of him going to an ATM in Miami; shots of his rental truck’s license plate at a tollbooth; phone records; and a map pinpointing his movements across the globe. All this information is then displayed on a clearly designed graphical interface that looks like something Tom Cruise would use in a Mission: Impossible movie.As the CIA analyst starts poking around on Fikri’s file inside of Palantir, a story emerges. A mouse click shows that Fikri has wired money to the people he had been calling in Syria. Another click brings up CIA field reports on the Syrians and reveals they have been under investigation for suspicious behavior and meeting together every day over the past two weeks. Click: The Syrians bought plane tickets to Miami one day after receiving the money from Fikri. To aid even the dullest analyst, the software brings up a map that has a pulsing red light tracing the flow of money from Cairo and Syria to Fikri’s Miami condo. That provides local cops with the last piece of information they need to move in on their prey before he strikes.Fikri isn’t real—he’s the John Doe example Palantir uses in product demonstrations that lay out such hypothetical examples. The demos let the company show off its technology without revealing the sensitive work of its clients. Since its founding in 2004, the company has quietly developed an indispensable tool employed by the U.S. intelligence community in the war on terrorism. Palantir technology essentially solves the Sept. 11 intelligence problem. The Digital Revolution dumped oceans of data on the law enforcement establishment but provided feeble ways to make sense of it. In the months leading up to the 2001 attacks, the government had all the necessary clues to stop the al Qaeda perpetrators: They were from countries known to harbor terrorists, who entered the U.S. on temporary visas, had trained to fly civilian airliners, and purchased one-way airplane tickets on that terrible day.An organization like the CIA or FBI can have thousands of different databases, each with its own quirks: financial records, DNA samples, sound samples, video clips, maps, floor plans, human intelligence reports from all over the world. Gluing all that into a coherent whole can take years. Even if that system comes together, it will struggle to handle different types of data—sales records on a spreadsheet, say, plus video surveillance images. What Palantir (pronounced Pal-an-TEER) does, says Avivah Litan, an analyst at Gartner, is “make it really easy to mine these big data sets.” The company’s software pulls off one of the great computer science feats of the era: It combs through all available databases, identifying related pieces of information, and puts everything together in one place.Depending where you fall on the spectrum between civil liberties absolutism and homeland security lockdown, Palantir’s technology is either creepy or heroic. Judging by the company’s growth, opinion in Washington and elsewhere has veered toward the latter. Palantir has built a customer list that includes the U.S. Defense Dept., CIA, FBI, Army, Marines, Air Force, the police departments of New York and Los Angeles, and a growing number of financial institutions trying to detect bank fraud. These deals have turned the company into one of the quietest success stories in Silicon Valley—it’s on track to hit $250 million in sales this year—and a candidate for an initial public offering. Palantir has been used to find suspects in a case involving the murder of a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement special agent, and to uncover bombing networks in Syria, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. “It’s like plugging into the Matrix,” says a Special Forces member stationed in Afghanistan who requested anonymity out of security concerns. “The first time I saw it, I was like, ‘Holy crap. Holy crap. Holy crap.’ ”Palantir’s engineers fill the former headquarters of Facebook along University Avenue in the heart of Palo Alto’s main commercial district. Over the past few years, Palantir has expanded to four other nearby buildings as well. Its security people—who wear black gloves and Secret Service-style earpieces—often pop out of the office to grab their lunch, making downtown Palo Alto feel, at times, a bit like Langley.Inside the offices, sweeping hand-drawn murals fill the walls, depicting tributes to Care Bears and the TV show Futurama. On one floor, a wooden swing hangs from the ceiling by metal chains, while Lord of the Rings knickknacks sit on desks. T-shirts with cutesy cartoon characters are everywhere, since the engineers design one for each new version of their software. Of late, they’ve run out of Care Bears to put on the shirts and moved on to My Little Ponies.The origins of Palantir go back to PayPal, the online payments pioneer founded in 1998. A hit with consumers and businesses, PayPal also attracted criminals who used the service for money laundering and fraud. By 2000, PayPal looked like “it was just going to go out of business” because of the cost of keeping up with the bad guys, says Peter Thiel, a PayPal co-founder.The antifraud tools of the time could not keep up with the crooks. PayPal’s engineers would train computers to look out for suspicious transfers—a number of large transactions between U.S. and Russian accounts, for example—and then have human analysts review each flagged deal. But each time PayPal cottoned to a new ploy, the criminals changed tactics. The computers would miss these shifts, and the humans were overwhelmed by the explosion of transactions the company handled.PayPal’s computer scientists set to work building a software system that would treat each transaction as part of a pattern rather than just an entry in a database. They devised ways to get information about a person’s computer, the other people he did business with, and how all this fit into the history of transactions. These techniques let human analysts see networks of suspicious accounts and pick up on patterns missed by the computers. PayPal could start freezing dodgy payments before they were processed. “It saved hundreds of millions of dollars,” says Bob McGrew, a former PayPal engineer and the current director of engineering at Palantir.After EBay acquired PayPal in 2002, Thiel left to start a hedge fund, Clarium Capital Management. He and Joe Lonsdale, a Clarium executive who’d been a PayPal intern, decided to turn PayPal’s fraud detection into a business by building a data analysis system that married artificial intelligence software with human skills. Washington, they guessed, would be a natural place to begin selling such technology. “We were watching the government spend tens of billions on information systems that were just horrible,” Lonsdale says. “Silicon Valley had gotten to be a lot more advanced than government contractors, because the government doesn’t have access to the best engineers.”Thiel, Lonsdale, and a couple of former colleagues officially incorporated Palantir in 2004. Thiel originally wanted to hire a chief executive officer from Washington who could navigate the Byzantine halls of the military-industrial complex. His co-founders resisted and eventually asked Alex Karp, an American money manager living in Europe who had been helping raise money for Clarium, to join as temporary CEO.It was an unlikely match. Before joining Palantir, Karp had spent years studying in Germany under Jürgen Habermas, the most prominent living representative of the Frankfurt School, the group of neo-Marxist philosophers and sociologists. After getting a PhD in philosophy from the University of Frankfurt—he also has a degree from Stanford Law School—Karp drifted from academia and dabbled in stocks. He proved so good at it that, with the backing of a handful of European billionaires, he set up a money management firm called the Caedmon Group. His intellect, and ability to solve a Rubik’s Cube in under a minute, commands an awed reverence around the Palantir offices, where he’s known as Dr. Karp.In the early days, Palantir struggled to sell its message and budding technology to investors. Big-name venture capital firms such as Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Sequoia Capital, and Greylock Partners all passed. Lonsdale says one investor, whom he won’t name, actually started laughing on the phone at Karp’s nonbusiness academic credentials. Overlooked by the moneyed institutions on Sand Hill Road, Thiel put up the original funds before enticing In-Q-Tel, the investment arm of the CIA, to invest as well. Karp says the reason VC firms “passed was that enterprise technology was not hot. And the government was, and still is, anti-hot.”Michael E. Leiter, the former head of the National Counterterrorism Center, recalls being skeptical when Karp arrived to sell Palantir’s system to the NCTC, created by President George W. Bush after the attacks. “There’s Karp with his hair and his outfit—he doesn’t look like me or the other people that work for me,” he says. But Leiter soon discovered that Palantir’s software cost a fraction of competing products and actually worked. Palantir not only made the connections between the data sets but also drew inferences based on the clues and empowered the analysts. Leiter is now a Palantir consultant.At 44, Karp has a thin, sinewy physique—the result of a strict 1,200-calorie-a-day diet—and an angular face that gives way to curly brown, mad-scientist hair. On a November visit at Palantir’s headquarters, he’s wearing purple pants and a blue and orange athletic shirt. As he does every day, he walked to work. “I never learned to drive because I was busy reading, doing things, and talking to people,” he says. “And I’m coordinated enough to bike, but the problem is that I will start dreaming about the business and run into a tree.”During the era of social networks, online games, and Web coupons, Karp and his engineers have hit on a grander mission. “Our primary motivation,” Karp says, “is executing against the world’s most important problems in this country and allied countries.” That’s an unusual pitch in Silicon Valley, where companies tend to want as little to do with Washington as possible and many of the best engineers flaunt their counterculture leanings.Palantir’s name refers to the “seeing stones” in Lord of the Rings that provide a window into other parts of Middle-earth. They’re magical tools created by elves that can serve both good and evil. Bad wizards use them to keep in touch with the overlord in Mordor; good wizards can peer into them to check up on the peaceful, innocent Hobbits of the Shire. As Karp explains with a straight face, his company’s grand, patriotic mission is to “protect the Shire.”Most of Palantir’s government work remains classified, but information on some cases has trickled out. In April 2010, security researchers in Canada used Palantir’s software to crack a spy operation dubbed Shadow Network that had, among other things, broken into the Indian Defense Ministry and infiltrated the Dalai Lama’s e-mail account. Palantir has also been used to unravel child abuse and abduction cases. Palantir “gives us the ability to do the kind of link-and-pattern analysis we need to build cases, identify perpetrators, and rescue children,” says Ernie Allen, CEO of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. The software recently helped NCMEC analysts link an attempted abduction with previous reports of the suspect to the center’s separate cyber-tip line—and plot that activity on a map. “We did it within 30 seconds,” Allen says. “It is absolutely a godsend for us.”In Afghanistan, U.S. Special Operations Forces use Palantir to plan assaults. They type a village’s name into the system and a map of the village appears, detailing the locations of all reported shooting skirmishes and IED, or improvised explosive device, incidents. Using the timeline function, the soldiers can see where the most recent attacks originated and plot their takeover of the village accordingly. The Marines have spent years gathering fingerprint and DNA evidence from IEDs and tried to match that against a database of similar information collected from villagers. By the time the analysis results came back, the bombers would be long gone. Now field operatives are uploading the samples from villagers into Palantir and turning up matches from past attacks on the spot, says Samuel Reading, a former Marine who works in Afghanistan for NEK Advanced Securities Group, a U.S. military contractor. “It’s the combination of every analytical tool you could ever dream of,” Reading says. “You will know every single bad guy in your area.”Palantir has found takers for its data mining system closer to home, too. Wall Street has been particularly receptive. Every year, the company holds a conference to promote its technology, and the headcount swelled from about 50 people at past events to 1,000 at the most recent event in October. “I saw bankers there that don’t go to any other conferences,” says Gartner’s Litan. The banks have set Palantir’s technology loose on their transaction databases, looking for fraudsters, trading insights, and even new ways to price mortgages. Guy Chiarello, chief information officer for JPMorgan Chase, says Palantir’s technology turns “data landfills into gold mines.” The bank has a Palantir system for fraud detection and plans to use the technology to better tailor marketing campaigns to consumers. “Google unlocked the Internet with its search engine,” Chiarello says. “I think Palantir is on the way to doing a similar thing inside the walls of corporate data.”One of the world’s largest banks has used Palantir software to break up a popular scam called BustOut. Criminals will steal or purchase access to thousands of people’s online identities, break into their bank and credit-card accounts, then spend weeks watching. Once they spot a potential victim purchasing a plane ticket or heading out on a holiday, they siphon money out of the accounts as fast as they can while the mark is in transit. The criminals hide their trails by anonymizing their computing activity and disabling alert systems in the bank and credit-card accounts. When the bank picks up on a few compromised accounts, it uses Palantir to uncover the network of thousands of other accounts that have to be tapped.A Palantir deal can run between $5 million and $100 million. The company asks for 20 percent of that money up front and the rest only if the customer is satisfied at the end of the project. Typically, it’s competing against the likes of Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and IBM, along with a scattering of less prominent data mining startups. “We can be up and running in a bank in eight weeks,” Karp says. “You will be getting results right away instead of waiting two to three years with our competitors.”Palantir has been doubling headcount every year to keep up with business. To get a job at the company, an applicant must pass a gauntlet of brain teasers. An example: You have 25 horses and can race them in heats of 5. You know the order the horses finished in, but not their times. How many heats are necessary to find the fastest? First and second? First, second, and third? (Answers: six, seven, and seven.) If candidates are able to prove themselves as what Karp calls “a software artist,” they’re hired. The company gives new arrivals some reading material, including a guide to improvisational acting, a lecture by the entrepreneur Steve Blank on Silicon Valley’s secret history with the military, and the book The Looming Tower: Al-Qaeda and the Road to 9/11. They’re also rewarded with a low wage by Silicon Valley standards: Palantir caps salaries at $127,000.Instead of traditional salespeople, Palantir has what it calls forward deployed engineers. These are the sometimes awkward computer scientists most companies avoid putting in front of customers. Karp figures that engineers will always tell the truth about the pros and cons of a product, know how to solve problems, and build up a strong reputation with customers over time. “If your life or your economic future is on the line,” he says, “and there is one company where people are maybe kind of suffering from Asperger’s syndrome, but they have always been accurate, you end up trusting them.”The director of these forward deployed engineers is Shyam Sankar, a Palantir veteran. In his corner office there’s a Shamu stuffed animal, an antique Afghan rifle hanging overhead, and a 150-year-old bed frame decorated with a wild, multicolored comforter. The bed comes in handy during an annual team-building exercise: For one week, employees live in the Palantir offices; the bedless make shantytown houses out of cardboard boxes. Sankar celebrates Palantir’s mix of office frivolity and low salaries. “We will feed you, clothe you, let you have slumber parties, and nourish your soul,” he says. “But this is not a place to come to get cash compensation.”Like many of the young engineers, Sankar recounts a personal tale that explains his patriotic zeal. When he was young, his parents moved from India to Nigeria, where Sankar’s father ran a pharmaceutical plant. One night, burglars broke into their home, pistol-whipped his dad, and stole some valuables. After that traumatic event, the family moved to Florida and started over, selling T-shirts to theme parks. “To come to a place and not have to worry about such bad things instilled a sense of being grateful to America,” Sankar says. “I know it sounds corny, but the idea here is to save the Shire.”Karp acknowledges that to outsiders, Palantir’s Middle-earth-meets-National Security Agency culture can seem a bit much. “One of my investors asked me, ‘Is this a company or a cult?’ ” he says. “Well, I don’t seem to be living like a cult leader.” Then he begins a discourse on how Palantir’s unusual ways serve the business. “I tend to think the critiques are true,” Karp says. “To make something work, it cannot be about the money. I would like to believe we have built a culture that is about a higher purpose that takes the form of a company. I think the deep character anomalies of the company are the reasons why the numbers are so strong.”Using Palantir technology, the FBI can now instantly compile thorough dossiers on U.S. citizens, tying together surveillance video outside a drugstore with credit-card transactions, cell-phone call records, e-mails, airplane travel records, and Web search information. Christopher Soghoian, a graduate fellow at the Center for Applied Cybersecurity in the School of Informatics and Computing at Indiana University, worries that Palantir will make these agencies ever hungrier consumers of every piece of personal data. “I don’t think Palantir the firm is evil,” he says. “I think their clients could be using it for evil things.”Soghoian points out that Palantir’s senior legal adviser, Bryan Cunningham, authored an amicus brief three years ago supporting the Bush Administration’s position in the infamous warrantless wiretapping case and defended its monitoring domestic communication without search warrants. Another event that got critics exercised: A Palantir engineer, exposed by the hacker collective Anonymous earlier this year for participating in a plot to break into the PCs of WikiLeaks supporters, was quietly rehired by the company after being placed on leave.Karp stresses that Palantir has developed some of the most sophisticated privacy protection technology on the market. Its software creates audit trails, detailing who has seen certain pieces of information and what they’ve done with it. Palantir also has a permission system to make sure that workers in agencies using its software can access only the data that their clearance levels allow. “In the pre-Palantir days, analysts could go into file cabinets and read whatever they want,” says former NCTC director Leiter. “Nobody had any idea what they had seen.” Soghoian scoffs at the privacy-protecting features Palantir builds into its software. “If you don’t think the NSA can disable the piece of auditing functionality, you have to be kidding me,” he says. “They can do whatever they want, so it’s ridiculous to assume that this audit trail is sufficient.”Thiel, who sits on the board and is an avowed libertarian, says civil liberties advocates should welcome Palantir. “We cannot afford to have another 9/11 event in the U.S. or anything bigger than that,” he says. “That day opened the doors to all sorts of crazy abuses and draconian policies.” In his view, the best way to avoid such scenarios in the future would be to provide the government the most cutting-edge technology possible and build in policing systems to make sure investigators use it lawfully.After Washington and Wall Street, Karp says the company may turn its attention to health care, retail, insurance, and biotech. The thinking is that Palantir’s technology can illuminate health insurance scams just as well as it might be able to trace the origin of a virus outbreak. Despite all this opportunity, and revenue that is tripling every year, Karp insists that Palantir will remain grounded. An IPO, while not out of the question, “dilutes nonmonetary motivation,” he says.One higher purpose in the coming year will be rescuing strapped companies and government bodies from the brink of financial ruin. Karp lists fraud, Internet security issues, Europe’s financial woes, and privacy concerns as possible drivers for Palantir’s business. For anyone in peril, the message is clear: Give us a signal and a forward deployed engineer will be at your doorstep. “There are some people out there that don’t think to pick up the phone and call us,” Karp says. “By next year, many of those people will.”'),\n",
       " (\"Disney's Big Ambitions for Swampy, an App Star\",\n",
       "  '2011-11-17',\n",
       "  'Where’s My Water?, the new mobile game from Walt Disney, stars Swampy, an alligator who lives in an underground sewer. The googly-eyed reptile likes to lounge around in his subterranean bathtub while he scrubs his back with a brush. Players swipe their fingers across an iPhone screen to guide water into his tub while dodging toxic sludge and collecting rubber duckies as prizes.With the 99¢ app, also available for the iPad, the House of Mickey is attempting to do something it has never done before: spin a multimillion-dollar franchise out of a character that made his debut on a 3.5-inch screen.So far the Swampy experiment is going swimmingly. Following its Sept. 22 release, Where’s My Water? quickly jumped to the top of the Apple App Store’s paid apps chart, displacing the record-setting Angry Birds game from the No. 1 spot for three weeks.The logic behind Disney’s new release is simple. A movie takes three to five years and hundreds of millions of dollars to make, and as with Mars Needs Moms, Disney’s big theatrical release this past spring, success is hardly guaranteed. The cost of a mobile game runs in the hundreds of thousands: It took a crew of seven people seven and a half months to produce Where’s My Water? If Swampy becomes a hit with kids, a follow-up movie could have a ready base of fans eager to buy tickets. “This is a very, very cost-effective way to develop characters,” says Tim Nollen, an analyst at Macquarie Capital (USA). “It’s a new way of doing things.”About 52 percent of kids 8 and younger have used a mobile device for games and other activities, according to a recent survey of 1,384 parents by Common Sense Media. “A new generation of Disney [fans] is growing up, and this is their main platform,” says Bart Decrem, senior vice-president and general manager of Disney Mobile, a 150-person unit. “My gut feeling is, over the next few years, someone will create a game with a billion gamers on it. We want to be that company.”Disney already has Swampy’s career plotted out. A 12-episode animated series will air on Disney.com and on YouTube sometime in the first quarter of 2012, part of a recent deal that will have the two companies spend as much as $15 million on co-branded content. A book and a movie featuring the cute green gator could follow, Decrem says.The company hopes to replicate Rovio Entertainment’s success in catapulting Angry Birds into something beyond a digital phenomenon. The Finnish game maker sells 1 million plush toys a month—along with T-shirts, school lunch boxes, and other gear—and publishes a comic strip online. There are also plans for educational books and a movie. There’s no reason why Disney, with its amusement parks, hundreds of stores, and a cruise line, can’t do the same, says Jack Kent, an analyst with researcher IHS Screen Digest: “Disney is one of the experts in merchandising,” he notes.Disney last year acquired social gaming company Playdom and mobile games maker Tapulous—where Decrem was chief executive officer. Working in this new medium required some adjustments for Disney’s animators. Swampy had to be able to show emotions within the constraints of a tiny phone screen. The company says it solved the problem by developing a special technique that does not require gamers to download large files. It also has put more effort into character development and storytelling than is typical for a mobile game—an investment it hopes will pay off as Swampy makes the progression from mobile devices to streaming video, and perhaps eventually the big screen. Disney is confident enough about its alligator’s ability to navigate the digital shoals that it’s already considering two more original characters for mobile gadgets. Says Decrem: “We want to create new characters that are born and sized for this platform.”The bottom line: Disney is testing audience appetite for a new character, Swampy, with an app and a video series before committing to an expensive feature film.'),\n",
       " ('All Those Stock Buybacks: A Bullish Sign?',\n",
       "  '2011-11-17',\n",
       "  'In what may be a vote of confidence in the economy and their own business prospects, companies have authorized spending more than $453 billion to buy their own stock this year, putting 2011 on track for the third-highest annual total behind 2006 and 2007, data compiled by Birinyi Associates show.Some analysts view the increase as a sign that companies can’t find anything better to do with their money amid economic weakness. Yet bulls say the rise shows executives are confident the U.S. economy will avoid a recession, which looked far more likely midyear. “If the corporate community really agreed on the idea we’re heading to a recession, they wouldn’t be buying back their stock,” says James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Minneapolis-based Wells Capital Management, which oversees about $333 billion.Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, which shunned buybacks for four decades, started a repurchase program in September with no set target as the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index fell for a fifth straight month. The company is a proxy for the U.S. economy: Berkshire businesses haul freight, produce power, and sell goods and services from carpeting to insurance. “We are not in any double-dip recession or anything like that,” Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Buffett said on Bloomberg Television on Sept. 30, four days after Berkshire Hathaway announced its buyback. “I’ve got 70-some businesses, and most of them are doing very well.”IBM has spent $11.5 billion on shares this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The computer services provider said in March that it would buy $50 billion of shares through 2015. Berkshire Hathaway has disclosed a $10.9 billion investment in IBM shares. Walt Disney began the single biggest U.S. plan this year, announcing a $16 billion buyback in May, equal to 20 percent of its market value, according to Birinyi data.With interest rates near record lows, some companies are even borrowing money to buy their own stock. Amgen said on Nov. 7 that it was buying $5 billion of shares, part of a $10 billion program. The company sold $6 billion in bonds to fund the transactions.Buybacks can benefit investors because by reducing the number of shares in the market, they boost a company’s earnings per share. “Share buybacks are clearly a flexible way to pay out some of the earnings to shareholders,” says Espen Furnes, an Oslo-based fund manager at Storebrand Asset Management. “I especially like it in mature businesses with limited growth opportunity.”Investors benefit more when executives spend money on equipment to fuel corporate growth or pay out dividends, according to Gregor Smith, a London-based fund manager at Daiwa Asset Management. “I’d rather see cash used for investment,” he says. “At the end of the day, there is a short-term illusory benefit from having fewer shares in issue.”Executives have faced criticism from shareholders and analysts in the past for launching buybacks when stock prices were high. The last buyback binge, in 2007, took place as stocks were starting an epic fall. The S&P 500 dropped 57 percent from October 2007 to March 2009. Today, valuations are lower than they were four years ago. The S&P 500 has traded for an average of 14.3 times reported earnings in 2011, 15 percent below the same period in 2007. Disney’s stock traded at 12.5 times estimated earnings on Nov. 15, compared with a 25.4 average since 1980, data compiled by Bloomberg show. “Given where our price is in the marketplace, we always look at buybacks,” Disney Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo said at a conference on Sept. 21. “And given where it has been this quarter, we’ve stepped that up aggressively.”The bottom line: Amgen was so eager to buy back its own shares that it raised $6 billion selling bonds to finance purchases.'),\n",
       " ('Why Frank Gehry Is Looking to Asia',\n",
       "  '2011-11-03',\n",
       "  'Architect Frank Gehry has designed some of America’s most respected examples of contemporary architecture, from Los Angeles’s steel-draped Walt Disney Concert Hall to IAC’s undulating white glass headquarters facing the Hudson River in Manhattan. Yet with real estate development in the world’s largest economy stalled, Gehry is chasing projects in Asia.Gehry, whose design for the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao in Spain’s Basque region was voted the most influential piece of architecture of the past 30 years in Vanity Fair’s 2010 World Architecture Survey, says he’s currently in the running to design a museum in one of China’s fast-expanding metropolitan areas, as well as a “very spiritual kind of a building” in India. He declined to give details.Gehry, 82, has plenty of reason to look for projects abroad. The Architecture Billings Index, an indicator of American construction, plunged to 46.9 in September from 51.4 in August, reflecting lower demand for design services, according to the American Institute of Architects. Any score below 50 indicates a decline in billings. Last year, architectural revenue for the top 250 architecture firms in the U.S. fell to $9.4 billion, from $10.2 billion in 2009. That compares with a year-over-year rise of 8.7 percent, to $12.5 billion, in 2008, according to Architectural Record.Experts in the building industry don’t expect the slump to end anytime soon—especially for the big marquee commissions for which Gehry is known. “The U.S. domestic market is not in the position right now to fund [major] projects in the private or public sector,” says Clark Manus, president at the American Institute of Architects and chief executive officer at San Francisco-based Heller Manus Architects. “This is the new normal.”Gehry isn’t the only major architect busy in Asia. Norman Foster, the British architect who designed London’s Swiss Re tower (popularly known as the Gherkin), is designing Hong Kong’s new museum and cultural district in West Kowloon. “The work opportunities internationally are greater than they’ve ever been, whether that’s in the Middle East or Asia,” says Manus, whose firm in October opened an office in China with five employees.In December, Gehry unveiled the design for his first Australian project. The 16,030-square-meter (172,545-square-foot) business school building at the University of Technology, Sydney, will have a “treehouse” design, incorporating a core yellow brick and crinkly glass structure, with “branches” spreading away from it, Gehry says. Still, he views the Asian mainland as his prime target. China this year announced plans to build or expand four major state museums by 2015, including a massive new art museum to be constructed near Beijing’s “Bird’s Nest” National Stadium. “There’s an art explosion in China,” Gehry says. “It’s really great—very exciting.” Gehry expects to sign a contract within three to four months should an agreement be reached for the Chinese museum project he’s pursuing.One challenge of designing on the mainland is the lower pay for projects, Gehry says. Architects get paid a percentage of construction costs, which in China are about a third of those in the U.S., he says. “If you take a percentage and you work with Western salaries, you can’t make it work,” explains Gehry. “So it almost forces you to open an office in China and work with local people.”Gehry says he would prefer to travel less and focus on projects closer to home: “At my age, I would love only to work in Los Angeles, maybe Santa Monica, maybe Beverly Hills.” Yet the lack of development in the U.S., along with a wish to keep business going at his Los Angeles-based Gehry Partners—where the head count fell from 250 in 2007 to 120 last year—is forcing him to look elsewhere.Pursuing foreign projects isn’t a panacea. Construction of one of Gehry’s projects abroad, the 450,000-square-foot Guggenheim Abu Dhabi museum, was halted last month by property developer Tourism Development & Investment as the emirate scales back plans made before the 2008 financial crisis. “The Abu Dhabi building we’ve been working on in the last five to six years has been stopped, and that’s painful,” says Gehry.The bottom line: With U.S. building stalled, architect Frank Gehry is looking for jobs in Asia. But building costs—and commissions—can be two-thirds lower.'),\n",
       " ('Can Netflix Regain Lost Ground?',\n",
       "  '2011-10-19',\n",
       "  'At Netflix, new hires are drilled in Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings’ guiding principles. Avoid “barnacles” that can slow down a fast-growing business, Hastings advises newcomers. Make tough decisions without agonizing and focus on great results rather than process, go his dictums, which are posted on the video service’s corporate site.Now Hastings, who founded Netflix in 1997, is learning the limits of his shoot-first credo. His attempt to navigate away from DVDs-by-mail and toward online movies and television shows resulted in a series of poorly explained pricing and service changes, announced by Hastings on the Netflix blog, that alienated customers and Wall Street.Besides becoming the butt of late-night TV hosts’ jokes, the company may have lost as many as 600,000 of its 24.6 million U.S. customers since July, estimates Darren Aftahi, an analyst with Northland Capital Markets. The extent of the damage should be revealed on Oct. 24, when the company announces earnings and subscriber numbers that will show how many customers have fled. “Moving forward step by step, despite the foot with the bullet hole,” Hastings wrote on his Facebook page in late September after striking a deal to add streaming titles from DreamWorks Animation, maker of the Shrek movies. He declined to comment.Hastings might have dodged the bullets had he paid more attention to process and reacted more speedily to his customers’ frustrations, expressed in the thousands of negative comments on the Netflix blog. The miscalculations began in April, when Hastings moved to end a debate within the company over how much of Netflix’s resources should be devoted to the DVD business, as opposed to streaming movies over the Web. Netflix executives expect the DVD business to decline over the next five years. Hastings’ plan, announced at an April staff meeting, was to separate and rename the DVD business Qwikster, according to a former employee. Customers were told in July that they would be charged $7.99 for each, instead of $9.99 for both.For years Netflix had carefully tested its products in focus groups assembled in the Lord of the Rings conference room in Building A at its Los Gatos (Calif.) headquarters campus or at rented space around the country. Focus groups have been asked about everything from the red color of DVD envelopes to the quality of video streams. This time Hastings skipped the focus group step, missing an opportunity to gauge customers’ potential reactions to separate websites and billing, according to the former employee. (Netflix spokesman Steve Swasey declined comment.) Instead, Hastings and his team relied on data showing that 75 percent of new signups before the price hike preferred streaming.After the April discussions, there was hardly any internal talk about the plans to split the businesses. At a July meeting, the company’s chief marketing officer said that she was monitoring reaction to the price hike announced in a blog posting on July 12, but made no mention of how the plan to spin off the DVD business into Qwikster would be communicated to subscribers, according to someone in attendance. Soon after, Netflix began moving workers at the DVD business into office space in San Jose and hiring Qwikster staffers, including a chief marketing officer.Netflix executives expected a spike in cancellations after the price increase, but thought it would be short-lived, Chief Financial Officer David Wells said at a conference on Sept. 21. Some of the company’s analysis proved correct: Even amid the backlash, the majority of new customers are opting for the $7.99-a-month streaming-only plan, skipping the add-on for DVDs, says Swasey. He points out that for the millions of customers who took the streaming-only plans, the price change was a “non-event.”The problem was with older users long accustomed to receiving the red DVD envelopes in the mail. Netflix had been working to wean them off of the three-at-a-time DVD habit to reduce costs, and Hastings wanted to move them more quickly to streaming only, Swasey says. But it turned out that those customers viewed the online service as a free add-on to DVDs, not the other way around, says James McQuivey, an analyst with Forrester Research. On Sept. 15, Netflix said it may have a net loss of 600,000 customers in the third quarter, reversing a trend of large subscriber gains. The defections may continue, with as many as 1.95 million subscribers dropping service in the fourth quarter, estimates Northland Capital’s Aftahi.Hastings believed that announcing new content deals for streamable content soon after the price increase would help calm subscribers and investors. Yet things worsened the day of the price hike when word spread that Netflix’s negotiations with Liberty Media’s Starz cable network had failed, and that Netflix would lose access to newer films from Walt Disney and Sony. That left the impression Netflix was losing content as it raised prices.Swasey says that the price increase only really mattered to half of Netflix’s members, and that the company could have done a better job explaining the economics of the move. “We should have said $2 a month for unlimited DVDs just wasn’t covering it,” he says. The company also should have explained to customers that the Starz deal was not so significant, since the content involved a small share of viewing and that the higher payment Starz demanded could be better spent on other fare. “That was another issue where we did not get out in front of it as well as we could have,” Swasey says.Hastings’ final miscue was his Sept. 18 blog post which purported to apologize to angry Netflix users. It came off badly when he took the opportunity to announce that the DVD operation would move to the new Qwikster service, says Dave Gray, senior vice-presiident at social-networking consultancy Dachis Group. “It was definitely a half-hearted, ‘We’re sorry you feel the way you do’ apology,” he says.Now that Netflix has backtracked on Qwikster, will all be forgiven or have some subscribers stopped listening? One warning sign: While Hastings’ apology and Qwikster announcement drew 27,842 spirited comments on Netflix’s blog, the company’s retraction of the breakup plan drew only 843.The bottom line: Netflix’s decision to raise prices and split its movie-delivery service may cost the company 600,000 subscribers.'),\n",

       "  '2011-10-13',\n",
       "  'The U.S. Supreme Court’s new term may turn out to be its most politically charged in decades. Already on the docket for the nine-month session that roughly coincides with the Presidential campaign are controversial cases including a challenge to the ban on nudity on broadcast TV. The high court is likely to accede to the Obama Administration’s request that it review the 2010 health-care law, which is being challenged by a group of 26 states, and may also agree to hear cases on immigration enforcement and affirmative action.The Case: U.S. v. Jones (Civil Liberties)\\nThe Challenge: The court will rule on whether police need a warrant before placing a tracking device on a car to monitor a suspect’s movements. (The Obama Administration says none is required.) The case will mark the first time the high court has considered how the ban on unreasonable searches applies to global positioning systems.\\n \\nThe Politics: Liberals would see a ruling favoring police as a further erosion of civil liberties in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks. Law-and-order Republicans are likely to support the Administration’s position.\\n \\nThe Case: Federal Communications Commission v. Fox Television Stations (Profanity)\\nThe Challenge: The court will decide whether federal regulators are violating the Constitution by imposing fines for on-air profanities and nudity. The case involves expletives uttered on two Fox network award shows and a scene featuring a naked woman on ABC’s NYPD Blue.\\n \\nThe Politics: News Corp.’s Fox and Walt Disney’s ABC have reason for optimism: In the court’s most recent term, the justices ruled in favor of free speech rights in four cases. This case may underscore divisions within the Republican Party between the religious right and the party’s probusiness, anti-regulation camp.\\n \\nThe Case: Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin (Affirmative Action)\\nThe Challenge: The Supreme Court is being asked to reconsider, or at least limit, its 2003 ruling upholding the use of race as a factor in university admissions for purposes of classroom diversity. The appeal is being pressed by Abigail Fisher, a rejected white applicant to the University of Texas at Austin.\\n \\nThe Politics: Foes of affirmative action—primarily social conservatives—are pinning their hopes on changes in the court’s makeup since 2003. Sandra Day O’Connor, author of the earlier ruling, stepped down in 2006. Her replacement, Samuel Alito, voted with the majority in a 2007 decision that placed new limits on public school integration efforts.The Case: Arizona v. U.S. (Immigration)\\nThe Challenge: The case stems from the Obama Administration’s challenge to a landmark 2010 Arizona law requiring local police officers to check the immigration status of people stopped for questioning. Arizona is seeking to overturn a ruling from a federal appeals court that blocked the law from taking effect on the grounds that it interferes with the national government’s authority over immigration policy.\\n \\nThe Politics: The impact of the court’s decision will go beyond Arizona, as five other states have enacted similar laws in recent years. A decision striking down the law would put the onus on Obama and the Democrats to show that the federal government can stop illegal immigration.\\n \\nThe Case: Multiple lawsuits (Health Care)\\nThe Challenge: The Administration, along with a group of 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business, wants the court to rule on the constitutionality of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010. At issue is the law’s requirement that individuals either purchase health insurance or pay a fine.\\n \\nThe Politics: A ruling declaring the law unconstitutional would be a big loss for the Obama Administration and turn the court itself into a campaign issue. A ruling upholding the law would burnish the President’s leadership credentials while fueling Republican calls for a legislative repeal.'),\n",
       " ('A Deeper Dish Network',\n",
       "  '2011-10-13',\n",
       "  'Charlie W. Ergen is no stranger to risky bets. The former professional blackjack player parlayed his early winnings into the second-largest U.S. satellite television service, Dish Network. Now the 58-year-old billionaire is making the biggest wager of his career. Ergen wants to transform Dish from a pay-TV provider to a wireless mobile video company that can take on both traditional cable rivals and online services such as Netflix.Dish has spent over $3 billion this year on three acquisitions of companies in bankruptcy—including the Blockbuster video chain—to combine video content and the valuable wireless spectrum that could be used to distribute programming to mobile devices like Apple’s iPad. Another Ergen-controlled company, set-top box maker EchoStar, spent $2 billion this past spring to buy satellite Internet service provider Hughes Communications. In September, Ergen rolled out a Blockbuster-branded movie-streaming service to Dish’s 14 million subscribers. His next addition could be Hulu, the online TV-service owned by News Corp., Walt Disney, and Comcast’s NBC Universal. Dish has made a $1.9 billion offer for Hulu, outbidding rivals including Amazon and Yahoo!, according to a person familiar with the bidding who was forbidden to speak on the record.All this could allow Ergen to cobble together what every satellite operator covets: a viable broadband alternative to cable companies such as Time Warner Cable or wireless giants like Verizon. “I don’t think we’re just a satellite TV company anymore,” says Joseph P. Clayton, who took over as Dish Chief Executive Officer in June so Ergen could focus on strategic vision as chairman. “Given the assets we’ve been accumulating, I don’t think it’s hard to see we’re moving in a different direction from simply pay-TV, which is a market that’s becoming increasingly saturated.”While Ergen’s pursuit of Hulu is ongoing, he’s been busily assembling the infrastructure to deliver movies and TV far beyond Dish subscribers. Satellite broadband has struggled to compete with speeds of cable and fiber networks because of the distance of satellites from earth. But Dish’s pending deals to acquire satellite broadband providers DBSD North America and TerreStar Networks—which both own wireless spectrum—could help Dish cobble together a hybrid terrestrial-satellite network that would let the company offer mobile Internet service bundled with TV.The company would still need a larger wireless network to reliably beam movies and TV shows directly to laptops, cell phones, and tablet computers, and to provide Net service. So Clayton says Dish may look at partnering with or acquiring a wireless company. That would allow Ergen to compete in what has become cable operators’ most profitable and fastest-growing business—providing broadband service.The weak economy may be pushing Dish to transform itself more quickly than archrival DirecTV. Industry leader DirecTV added video customers last quarter while Dish lost 135,000, its second-largest quarterly decline in at least a decade. Dish offers less expensive video packages, attracting lower-income customers who are more likely to cancel service for financial reasons or buy lower-margin packages. The image of being “cheap, cheap, cheap” is one Clayton would like to avoid, he says. “I’m not sure that’s the right way to go as we move to a more advanced technical platform with our products,” he told analysts in August.Dish has been tight-lipped about its ultimate plans. Yet its new Blockbuster Movie Pass may be a hint at how Dish wants to change. A Dish customer with Movie Pass can have satellite-TV, thousands of Blockbuster on-demand movies, access to video game and DVD rentals, and streaming online content for $39.99 a month for the first year. Dish customers can also share all that content among multiple mobile devices using technology developed by mobile video pioneer Sling Media, which Ergen bought in 2007.Clayton says a Blockbuster online-streaming service will soon be available to non-Dish subscribers. Blockbuster gets its physical DVDs 28 days earlier than Netflix, a vestige of studio agreements intended to keep Blockbuster afloat during its pre-bankruptcy days. Ergen is now negotiating to get the digital rights a month earlier as well, though he’s unlikely to be given that preferential treatment, according to two Hollywood studio executives who declined to be named because the negotiations are private. There’s also concern among content providers that if Ergen buys Hulu, he’ll control so much distribution that he’ll have a stronger hand in future negotiations—including those with Hulu’s current owners.“You look at all of the bandwidth we own with our satellite capacity, and now having IP-connected set-top boxes, our ability to offer content to a consumer leaning back in his living room is pretty powerful,” says Blockbuster President Michael Kelly, who has worked for Ergen for nearly a decade at Dish and EchoStar.Adding Hulu would give Ergen the rights to more content and 1 million paying subscribers to whom he could stream movies and TV shows, as well as additional ad revenue. Dish is also converting 150 Blockbuster brick-and-mortar stores to hybrid shops where customers can sign up for Dish packages and rent a DVD. “What Charlie’s done is put together content and distribution,” says media investment banker Peter M. Hoffman, a partner at GHL. “Netflix still has to rely on someone else’s distribution to deliver its content. If I was Netflix, I’d be a little worried.”The bottom line: Ergen’s companies have spent more than $5 billion this year on acquisitions that could enable them to become a power in video.'),\n",

       "  '2011-10-13',\n",
       "  \"In late 2006, 22-year-old Adam D’Angelo confronted a serious problem. Facebook, then a small Silicon Valley startup, had picked him to be its chief technology officer. He was bursting with ideas about how to make the social-networking site bigger, faster, and more appealing. To make those dreams come true, Facebook relied on a couple dozen scruffy young engineers, crammed together in a graffiti-covered office. Reinforcements were desperately needed. D’Angelo and his colleagues refused to settle for any available programmer, fearing that lax standards would destroy the company’s innovative culture. Facebook was scrambling to master on-campus recruiting and to lure stars from Google and Microsoft, but those old-fashioned hiring channels weren’t paying off fast enough. Something quicker and more nimble was needed.D’Angelo proposed that Facebook publish gnarly programming challenges and invite engineers anywhere to solve them. These wouldn’t be the superficial brainteasers that some companies used, like estimating the number of piano tuners in Chicago. Instead, Facebook’s website would issue multi-hour tests of coding prowess. With a bit of wit, these puzzles would find and deliver the right kind of people to the California startup.Facebook engineer Yishan Wong volunteered to draft puzzles so hard that he couldn’t solve them. Before long, Wong and D’Angelo realized that their whimsy might serve a bigger purpose, too. “We developed this theory that occasionally there were these brilliant people out there who hadn’t found their way to Silicon Valley,” Wong recalled. “They might be languishing in ordinary tech jobs. We needed a way to surface them.” Goofy puzzles—some involved dinosaurs or gamblers—looked like the perfect bait.Meanwhile, in Portland, Me., on a cobblestoned road known as Milk St., Portland Webworks was cranking out corporate websites for lawyers and consultants. Among the programmers there was Evan Priestley, a large, round-faced fellow in his early twenties. He was building expertise in Web applications development while growing tired of humdrum tasks—such as adjusting shades of blue for individual customers who weren’t sure what they wanted. “They were always saying: ‘Can you build us some Internets?’” Priestley later remarked.No big-league recruiter was likely to rescue Priestley. “I had a pretty terrible résumé,” he later observed. He had quit high school a few weeks before graduation because classes became unbearably tedious. He switched majors three times at the University of Southern Maine for similar reasons. Eventually he left college without a degree. Most people pegged Priestley as a slacker.One afternoon, Priestley had finished early, so he started reading an online news site, reddit.com. One posting alluded to Facebook’s puzzlers. Welcoming the mental workout, Priestley began wrestling with ways of automatically seating a clique of people in a movie theater, given that best friends want to be side by side and rivals need to be far apart. The puzzle looked hard and shapeless at first. After 45 minutes, Priestley cracked it. He double-checked his programming solution, decided it worked, and e-mailed it 2,500 miles west, to Facebook headquarters.Impressed with Priestley’s approach, Facebook flew him to Palo Alto for a job interview. Engineer Marc Kwiatkowski tested the newcomer, face-to-face, on a trickier problem. As Priestley later recalled, “I told Marc what answer he probably wanted—and I explained why it was a badly constructed problem. You were supposed to speed up one piece of the code. But it didn’t address the fact that 98percent of the time was being wasted on network requests.”Kwiatkowski smiled, and then decided Priestley was right. A week later, Facebook hired the man from Maine.A new era of talent hunting has begun. It’s happening not only at high-tech companies such as Facebook, but also at Army bases, ad agencies, investment banks, Hollywood studies, corporate boardrooms, college admissions offices, and even at nanny agencies. In all these fields, experts don’t just sort résumés. They pick people and build teams in a profoundly different way. Traditional measures of past achievement, such as test scores and academic degrees, are losing power, and companies are getting better at looking for those future superstars who deliver many times the value of someone who is merely good.At Google, Todd Carlisle is director of staffing. In 2005, he began an experiment, collecting factors that might distinguish between hiring great employees and picking the wrong people. Within a few months, Carlisle had some answers. Most supposed markers of success turned out to be mirages. When all the number-crunching was done, several dozen factors—including tidbits like the age when a recruit got into computers—emerged as ones that could help predict candidates’ chances.What Google learned was that it had been looking at résumés far too narrowly. The company had started out by focusing inordinately on candidates’ education, grade-point averages, and even SAT scores. The thinking was that high-IQ people would do best at Google, and that the best way of gauging brainpower was to look at classroom records. Google ended up with lots of PhD holders from Stanford, MIT, Caltech, and top Ivy League schools. But by the time Carlisle got to work, Google was finding that some of these geniuses weren’t quite as effective as it had hoped. Even more important, company insiders worried that they might be turning away a lot of talented people whose true abilities surpassed their academic credentials.“Take the wide view” became the overriding lesson of Carlisle’s experiment. There was room at Google for people whose grades had faltered because they were working 30 hours a week to pay for college. There was room for highly competitive people who had chased an athletic dream when they were younger—and now were applying that same relentless energy to professional goals. There was room, especially in nonengineering fields, for people who weren’t great students but had been running businesses, tutoring, volunteering, and otherwise being civic leaders from their teenage days onward.Such candidates would stay invisible if Google rigidly scanned résumés the traditional way, from top to bottom; as many as 75,000 a week streamed into Google’s offices. So many candidates chased so few openings that if reviewers didn’t see some “Wow!” factor right away, they hit the “Reject” button. The best hope of spotting these hidden winners, Carlisle came to believe, was to steal a quick peek at the bottom of the résumé. He became known as the man who analyzed them “upside down.” Now, when Carlisle pulls one up on his laptop—which happens dozens of times a day—he begins by tapping the “Page Down” key a couple times until he reaches the final entries.Then he scrutinizes the loose ends of candidates’ bios. “I want to know their stories,” Carlisle explained one morning. “I want to know what these people are all about.” In a moment, he might start hunting for the classic markers of competence: work history, education, credentials, and the like. But first he wants to see if some special, rare attribute could point the way to greatness.Far more than the search for programmers and tech execs has changed. The U.S. Army’s Special Forces size up candidates in a 19-day selection process in which no bullets are fired. The Army isn’t looking for the world’s best shooters; it can teach that. What it wants are resilient soldiers who can tackle unpredictable challenges. One test is to ask a group of prospects to move a trailer that’s missing a wheel 2.5 miles. The soldiers have some pipes, rope, and other objects at their disposal. The bare axle can never touch the ground. What they don’t know is that there isn’t a good way to put the elements together to get it done. A sergeant watches not to find who has the best solution but who best handles the fact that there is no answer. The winning candidates may not be honors graduates of West Point, but they have the grit that can pay off in tough, isolated assignments overseas. Likewise, at a test facility known as the Shooting House, at the FBI’s main training site in Quantico, Va., recruits are watched as much for when they don’t fire as for when they do.The art of talent scouting also involves knowing what shortcomings don’t matter, which flaws can be overlooked. In sports, for instance, where talent spotting has been developed into a high art, it often means discounting size, strength, or an odd delivery. Baseball scout Herb Raybourn made the best call of his career many years ago in a small town in Panama, while watching a 21-year-old converted shortstop trying to make it as a pitcher. The prospect’s fastball clocked in at an undistinguished 84 to 87 mph. But Raybourn loved the pitcher’s loose, easy motion—and saw lots of room for improvement. For a base payment of just $2,500 cash, Raybourn signed future Hall of Famer Mariano Rivera to a contract with the New York Yankees. Likewise, many of the scouts who first saw Tim Lincecum pitch in college knew that he had first-pick statistics, but couldn’t get over the fact that he was short and slight for a pitcher. The San Francisco Giants picked him tenth, and he won a Cy Young Award two years later.Corporate directors are also taking fresh looks at the process of picking chief executive officers. Recent academic studies show that charisma and affability may be overrated as traits that lead to CEO success. Efficiency, problem-solving, and hard-nosed accountability appear to be more valuable. If directors aren’t confident they can pick out the winning elements, consultants such as Randy Street are devising new interviewing techniques and simulations meant to establish which highfliers deserve a shot. He spends four hours at a minimum discussing each candidate’s life. He is looking for details that can’t appear on a résumé.Priestley’s first few months at Facebook were impressive. He started on a team of programmers figuring out how to speed up Facebook’s underlying computer infrastructure. Then he helped develop a framework that made it easier for users to add games, maps, and other applications to their Facebook experience. He was a computing polyglot, switching from PHP to Ajax to other programming languages as needed. He worked days; he worked nights. Whatever Priestley didn’t know, he learned in self-run tutorials. One time, Facebook’s site stopped working for a small group of users. It turned out their computers were burdened with an obscure, out-of-date security program. No one at Facebook knew what to do. At 11p.m., Priestley rustled up the Internet’s only publicly available information about this security program—written in Dutch. By daybreak, Priestley and a partner had gained familiarity with Dutch terms such as foutmelding and beveiliging. They rejiggered Facebook’s internal code, and the problem was fixed.Priestley wasn’t the only genius from nowhere to arrive on Facebook’s doorstep. As the company’s puzzles became well-known, programmers spent as much as 40 hours trying to devise solutions. Most of their efforts didn’t work. About 10 percent of the submissions amounted to accurate, viable programs. Within that pool, a much smaller number of the solutions displayed true elegance. The standout candidates earned job interviews at Facebook. Contestants who passed all regular screening tests were invited onboard.Among these new hires was Jonathan Hsu, a graduate of Harvey Mudd College in southern California. He joined Facebook’s engineering team in July 2007 and began working on online ad software. Soon a beguiling extra job opened up. The original puzzle creator, Yishan Wong, left for paternity leave. Facebook needed someone new to oversee its growing collection of software quizzes. At a minimum, that meant sizing up candidates’ attempted solutions.Hsu became the Puzzle Master. Each time Hsu posted a new puzzle, he added mischievous details that typified Facebook’s jaunty culture. In one problem, contestants were asked to help identify intoxicated users who couldn’t type properly anymore. It was repackaged as the “Breathalyzer.” To deal with this imaginary scenario, contestants needed to catch flurries of typos in unfamiliar texts, while absolving passages with rarer errors. Solving this challenge required shrewd use of a sophisticated look-up function. Hsu’s version made this task seem like a late-night dorm game.Even the Puzzle Master’s identity and contact information became a baffler. The puzzle site’s opening picture never showed Hsu or any other individual. Instead, visitors saw an odd version of a lowercase f, consisting of many brightly colored rectangular slivers, all pressed together. Most viewers thought it was abstract art. The right ones realized that the f was a puzzle in its own right, written in Piet. Piet is a computer language in which all terms are represented as rectangles in the style of abstract artist Piet Mondrian. Thousands of people looked at the f each week. During a 30-month span, only 42 figured it out. The program yielded a secret e-mail address at Facebook, so solvers could alert the social networking company to their prowess.From 2008 to 2010, outsiders e-mailed as many as 200 attempted puzzle answers a day to Facebook headquarters. It didn’t matter if the vast majority of submissions were clumsy or wrong. It was so easy, fast, and cheap to evaluate entries automatically—and then have Hsu take a closer look at the best submissions—that puzzle solving became a valuable tool in Facebook’s hunt for new engineers. Mainstream candidates were also encouraged to try the puzzles. Willingness to spend hours on a puzzle helped establish who really wanted to work at Facebook; clever solutions sharpened Facebook’s ability to spot the best coders. As of February 2011, Hsu estimated, some 118 engineers, or 20 percent of Facebook’s technical workforce at the time, had solved puzzles as part of their path into the company.One of Hsu’s favorite discoveries was David Alves, a 2001 high school graduate who was still working his way through San José State in 2009. Alves’s college wasn’t known as a computer-studies citadel. Once Alves solved a puzzle and caught the eye of Facebook’s recruiters, however, the sidelights of his résumé commanded attention. He regularly earned top-10 recognition in programming contests pitting as many as 600 entrants against one another. He was president of San José State’s computer science club. Alves might have come from an obscure school, but he was ready to contribute.These days, Facebook has a big, polished recruiting department, led by Lori Goler, a former Walt Disney and EBay executive. Many of the gung-ho engineers who championed offbeat programming challenges during Facebook’s coming of age, including Puzzle Master Hsu, have moved on; puzzles now are more tightly integrated into other recruiting methods. Last month, Facebook installed a new batch of puzzles, involving variables such as k and n, to replace the old bafflers involving dinosaurs and Red Bull.Even so, Facebook keeps hunting for engineers without staring at résumés. At least five times a year it stages free-wheeling coding contests either at university campuses or Facebook headquarters. These events, known as hackathons or Hacker Cups, take on a carnival-like quality, as contestants race to complete programming challenges within a matter of hours. At one contest last year, Facebook offered a prize of $500 and a chance to meet company founder Mark Zuckerberg. The winning entry was a smartphone app called Airchalk that lets users wave their phones and create images on a whiteboard. It delighted Facebook’s judges so much that they decided the creators deserved even more. The contest champions, brothers Hani and Islam Sharabash of the University of Illinois, were hired on as summer interns.Excerpted from George Anders's The Rare Find: Spotting Exceptional Talent Before Everyone Else, to be published by Portfolio on Oct. 18.\"),\n",
       " ('Steve Jobs: The Wilderness, 1985-1997',\n",
       "  '2011-10-06',\n",
       "  'On May 31, 1985, a few hours after he had been stripped of all authority at the company he had co-founded, Steve Jobs sat bewildered and puffy-eyed on a mattress in his nearly furniture-less 30-room mansion. Apple Computer had subsumed his entire adult life. He was 30 and unmarried. With no one to come home to, Jobs spent hours that evening talking to whichever of his friends picked up the phone. He sounded desperate enough that former Apple executive Mike Murray raced over to the mansion. “I didn’t think he should be alone,” says Murray.A month later, Jobs had recovered sufficiently to travel with a girlfriend through Russia and Italy, flirt with California’s Democratic Party bosses about a possible Senate run, and, after a conversation with Nobel laureate Paul Berg [footnote 1] about the need for more powerful computers for science students, muse about creating a new kind of computer company. In September, Jobs announced that he was quitting Apple and its board, where his role was almost entirely ceremonial, to start NeXT Computer. NeXT machines would power the world’s top brains by simplifying powerful UNIX computers for the higher education market. That was the plan, anyway.Despite promises not to compete with Apple, Jobs wooed some of Apple’s best managers, including Bud Tribble, who’d led development of the Macintosh operating system; education market chief Dan’l Lewin; and Susan Barnes, a graphic artist who had created many of the Mac’s famous icons. He either called his targets from the remote office to which he’d been banished or invited them for long neighborhood walks, where he made the NeXT pitch. Jobs ended up landing six recruits, who joined him most days that September at his mansion for brainstorming sessions and meals prepared by a married couple, both chefs, who lived in Jobs’s guest cottage. Nothing at these meetings was put on paper. Jobs knew he was daring Apple to sue him—and Apple did just that a few weeks after NeXT launched, accusing Jobs of “nefarious” raiding of Apple staffers who were armed with trade secrets. The company pulled the suit a few days after filing rather than risk revealing trade secrets in the discovery process.Jobs had sold $14 million of his $100 million Apple stake. (He would soon sell the rest.) He poured most of it into making NeXT look less like a startup than an immediate Apple competitor. Millions went into the construction of a state-of-the-art factory [footnote 2] in Fremont, Calif., so posh that Jobs hosted dinners there. It would pay for itself, provided NeXT could sell more than 150,000 of the workstations it planned to offer each year. He also rented airy office space in a Palo Alto building that had an I.M. Pei-designed stairway, [footnote 3] and he loaded the place up with $10,000 sofas and $5,000 chairs. Famed graphic designer Paul Rand received a $100,000 fee to create the company’s logo.NeXT had style in abundance, and it had funding. Electronic Data Systems (EDS) founder H. Ross Perot invested $20 million, and Canon later put in $100 million. What it lacked was discipline. Apple’s 21st century dominance has been built on a limited product line and Jobs’s insistence that Apple use only proven outside technologies. At NeXT, by contrast, Jobs crammed the Hartmut Esslinger-designed cube-shaped computer with every shiny new toy he could find. There was an Ethernet port for easy networking; a microphone and speech-processing software; a patented, hard-to-manufacture monitor stand; and a magneto-optical drive he predicted would be faster and cheaper than a floppy. The result was a computer that cost $10,000 to make—and wasn’t worth the price. “We had 350 employees,” recalls Chris MacAskill, who ran developer relations for NeXT. “And 349 didn’t want to bet the company on that stupid magneto-optical drive.”Jobs received ample feedback that his strategy was as muddled as his product vision. Former Sun Microsystems CEO Jonathan Schwartz sparred with Jobs about software. NeXT didn’t run the Microsoft Office suite. Instead it relied on a handful of companies, such as Schwartz’s Lighthouse, to make knock-off apps. Jobs wanted the software guys to sell their wares for $99, similar to PC packages at the time. “When you sell your computer at PC prices, I’ll give you PC pricing on my software,” Schwartz told him, before pricing Lighthouse software for NeXT at $1,000. According to former NeXT managers including MacAskill, Lighthouse ended up being one of only a handful of software firms to make money from its NeXT products.If Jobs knew NeXT was a loser, he rarely let on. He remained demanding, confident, and grandiose. Asked to deliver the keynote speech at a computer trade show at the Javits Convention Center in Manhattan, Jobs told MacAskill to ship out Jobs’s own desk—complete with the vase and red rose he always kept there—for him to sit at onstage. He insisted that the desk be placed at a 28-degree angle, to match the angle of Rand’s box-shaped logo, which was tipped to one side. A few minutes before the curtains opened, MacAskill begged Jobs not to introduce a new Lotus spreadsheet that hadn’t been cleared by Lotus. “Fine,” Jobs said, “then you do the speech,” and walked off “only to return as the curtain opened.” MacAskill says he and everyone else put up with the volatility and withering personal insults because “we really thought we had the chance to change the world.”The hopes of the NeXT team would remain just that, however. The seeds of Jobs’s renaissance actually trace back to a different source. While Jobs was still at Apple, he and Alan Kay, a technologist at the company, took a limo to visit a small special-effects outfit in Marin County owned by Star Wars creator George Lucas. Lucas was going through a divorce and looking to spin off the company, which would come to be known as Pixar. It aspired to create the world’s first feature-length animated movie made entirely on computers. Given the state of computing power at the time, the goal was years away, but Jobs left the meeting convinced that Apple should buy Lucas’s company to help extend its lead in graphics.Following his ouster from Apple, Jobs made a $5 million offer. Pixar founders Ed Catmull and Alvy Ray Smith thought it was too low, and worried that Jobs was more interested in computers than movies—and more focused on repairing his legacy than supporting their dreams. “We didn’t want to be the first woman after the divorce,” Catmull later explained to staffers.Catmull and Smith instead pursued deals with SGI, Microsoft, and EDS, then a subsidiary of General Motors. None of them worked out. (GM’s joint bid with Philips Electronics was all but inked, but fell through when EDS founder and future NeXT investor Perot was booted from GM’s board.) In the end, Jobs bought Pixar for $10 million—roughly a tenth of the opening weekend box office for 2010′s Toy Story 3 and 0.13 percent of the $7.4 billion Walt Disney would pay for Pixar [footnote 4] in 2006.Jobs’s initial approach to running Pixar mirrored his approach to NeXT. The suspicions of Catmull and Smith were correct: Jobs wasn’t that interested in making movies. Rather than special effects, Jobs focused on a corporate-sales business, which he believed was more vital to the company’s future. He positioned Pixar to sell $150,000 computers loaded with Pixar software to corporate graphics departments—and gave the cash-strapped company $100,000 to hire Esslinger’s Frog Design to design the machine. Jobs indulged former Disney animator John Lasseter by forking over a few hundred thousand dollars a year to create three-minute shorts—Luxo Jr., Red’s Dream, and Tin Toy, in which metal objects such as lamps, unicycles, and drummer-boy toys came alive. The shorts wowed the crowd at the annual graphics industry convention each year, even if Jobs remained somewhat indifferent to them.By 1990, Jobs and co-founder Smith were warring for Pixar’s soul. At a board meeting that year, after screaming at each other from just inches apart like an umpire and manager, Smith tried to grab a whiteboard marker from Jobs. “You know how Jobs loves to control that whiteboard, but I’d had enough,” says Smith, who says Jobs began making fun of his Southern accent. “He was street-fighting. It was ugly.” Smith left less than a year later, when Jobs O.K.’d his plan to use a Pixar technology to create a new graphics company. Then Jobs wrote him out of Pixar’s history, says Smith. You won’t find any mention of him on the company’s website. “It’s all true—the good and the bad,” says Smith of working with Jobs. “Even if we don’t like each other, he financed us when nobody else would.”For a while it appeared that both of Jobs’s new companies would fail. When he was finally ready to unveil his first NeXT prototypes in October 1988, Jobs pumped up expectations by renting out San Francisco’s Davies Symphony Hall. The machine played a duet with one of the symphony’s violinists. The first NeXT wouldn’t go on sale until a year later, and when it did, no amount of showmanship could distract from its $6,500 price—which was many thousands more than the price target in the original NeXT business plan. (Jobs never made the mistake of pre-announcing a product again.)Jobs tried to find more customers by signing distribution deals with IBM and Businessland, a chain of computer stores, and releasing a new 1990 model priced at $5,000 that at least nodded to consumer needs with a traditional floppy drive. By 1992 key staffers, including Tribble and hardware engineering chief Rich Page, were leaving. At one board meeting around this time, Perot [footnote 5] was discussing how NeXT needed to do a better job listening to consumers. Jobs walked out on him. “Did the CEO of this company just walk out on me?” asked Perot, according to a former NeXT executive. “Does that mean I get my $20 million back?” NeXT kept Perot’s money but lost him from the board. He resigned in June 1992. (Perot did not respond to requests for comment.)The situation at Pixar was just as dire—and financially worse for Jobs. Without a steady source of revenue, he was forced to write more than $40 million in personal checks to keep the business afloat. “It was not an insignificant portion of my net worth,” [footnote 6] he told BusinessWeek in 1998. “There were times that we all despaired, but fortunately not all at the same time.”What changed everything was not Jobs’s intuitive sense of the market nor his vision as a product guy but a cowboy and an astronaut. After more than a decade of annual treks to Disney’s headquarters in Burbank, Pixar had pushed the state of the art to the point that it finally landed a three-film production contract in 1991. By early 1994 it was clear that the company’s first movie, Toy Story, was going to be extraordinary.Jobs wasn’t born to the movie business, but he’d surrounded himself with creative people during his days at Apple and, as he explained in 1998, it merely took time to adapt that experience from one discipline to another. “Hollywood and Silicon Valley exist in the same state, but they have absolutely no idea about each other,” said Jobs. “It’s hard work [making good movies]. That’s why so much of it isn’t any good—just like with software.” Jobs would also win respect for knowing the limits of his expertise. After a few unsuccessful attempts to stick his fingers in the movie-making process, he took the hint from Pixar staffers and agreed to stay out of all story meetings, according to several former Pixar staffers. Former Walt Disney Studios head Joe Roth remembers that, before Toy Story came out, Jobs argued it should be marketed as the first fully computerized movie. Roth and others disagreed. “I said we’re going to sell it as a great story, and let people be wowed by the tech,” Roth told BusinessWeek. “And you know what? He said O.K.”In the weeks before Toy Story‘s Nov. 22, 1995, release, Pixar was more than $4 million in debt, with revenues of just $10 million, according to SEC filings. The company was tiny. Only the advance buzz about Toy Story gave Pixar’s future any shape. Former Pixar Marketing Vice-President Pamela Kerwin says that Larry Sonsini, Jobs’s friend and the chairman of Silicon Valley law firm Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, told her and other Pixar executives that Jobs’s idea of an initial public offering at that point was delusional. Yet for the first time in years, Jobs was telling people he felt he had a great product in his back pocket—and one that wasn’t aimed at the suits and academics he’d targeted with the NeXT cube, but at the upscale, mainstream consumers he’d won over at Apple.Jobs told Goldman Sachs’s bankers to time a Pixar IPO around the debut of the movie. Ten days after Toy Story opened to long lines and soaring reviews, Pixar went public at $22 a share. When the stock closed at $33 that afternoon, Jobs celebrated by sampling 150-year-old balsamic vinegar. With an 80 percent stake in the company, he was a paper billionaire. He called his friend Larry Ellison to say he’d made it to the B-club.Suddenly, Jobs was no longer just a computer guy. There were changes in his personal life, too. In 1991 he married Laurene Powell, whom he had met while preparing to give a talk at Stanford Business School. Avi Tevanian, NeXT’s software chief, and another executive arranged for a low-key bachelor party at a well-known San Francisco eatery. After they sat down, Jobs decided they needed to go to a nearby spot that made only soufflés. The wedding, a small affair held at the Ahwahnee Hotel in Yosemite National Park, was officiated by a Buddhist monk. The newlyweds moved to Palo Alto and had their first child, Reed, named for the college Jobs attended but never graduated from. Jobs soon welcomed his estranged daughter, Lisa [footnote 7], back into his house, as well.By all accounts, Jobs had entered a contented middle age, the Sturm und Drang of his Apple days now fading into history. During an appearance to promote Toy Story‘s DVD release on Oct. 30, 1996, Jobs was asked by Charlie Rose whether Apple could turn itself around. “It’s just a spectator sport for me now,” said Jobs. Rose didn’t buy it; he bet Jobs that he’d be doing something in computing within five years. “Oh, I tend to stay with what I start until somebody kicks me out.” Jobs wasn’t truly indifferent about Apple, of course. He told friends that the company was dying. When Ellison explored purchasing Apple in 1996, Jobs told BusinessWeek that he tried to talk him out of it. “I thought he’d lose his shirt.”NeXT wasn’t performing any better. With money rapidly disappearing, Jobs had announced in early 1993 that NeXT would get out of the costly hardware business. Instead it would license its NeXTStep software, a variant of the powerful UNIX operating system that could work with many processors and more effectively handle sound and graphics. The move was long overdue, but according to Tevanian, Jobs lost interest once there were no more sleek machines to make. By 1995, Jobs told a family friend that he was prepared to let NeXT go bankrupt.In 1996, a marketing manager at NeXT took it upon himself to call Apple to gauge its interest in NeXTStep. It was an open secret in Silicon Valley that Apple had given up on its own crumbling operating system and was in talks to buy tiny software maker Be Inc. so it could start fresh, replacing MacOS with BeOS. Jobs had no idea about any of this. He found out only when he happened to call a NeXT colleague at the same moment that a team from Apple arrived for a NeXTStep demo, say former NeXT executives.It did not take him long to capitalize. On Dec. 2, 1996, Jobs demonstrated NeXTStep to Apple CEO Gil Amelio in a conference room at Palo Alto’s Garden Court Hotel. “He turned on the charm that day,” says former Apple CFO Fred Anderson. Apple ended up paying $430 million for NeXT, well above the $185 million price Be CEO Jean-Louis Gasse had agreed to sell his company for. Upon hearing the news, Gasse fumed to BusinessWeek that “Steve cast a homoerotic spell on Amelio and the Apple board,” though he says now, “It was the best thing for the world.” On the night of the deal, Jobs said: “I’ve been gone for 11 years. Apple’s a very different place, and I’m a very different person.”The Jobs who returned to Apple’s Cupertino campus for the first time in a decade initially betrayed no signs of wanting to run the company. Although Apple dug up his original ID badge, he rarely came into the office, choosing instead to invite Apple executives for walks around Palo Alto. But as weeks passed he couldn’t hide his disapproval of Amelio’s strategy for keeping Apple out of bankruptcy. An executive remembers Jobs walking out of one meeting and calling Amelio “a bozo.” When Apple’s board ousted Amelio in July 1997, Jobs at first refused to take the job full-time, choosing to call himself “the iCEO,” for “interim.” He only dropped the “interim” in early 2000, when the board gave him a Gulfstream V jet and options for 10 million Apple shares which later turned out to have been improperly backdated, to artificially raise their value to the share price at an earlier date.His first moments back at the helm certainly seemed like “Old Steve.” Minutes after Amelio gave his goodbye to the executive staff, Jobs—clad in shorts and scruffy as a beach bum—walked in and swiveled in his chair at the head of the board table. Rhetorically, he asked the group why Apple was in such poor shape. Before anyone could answer, he roared: “The products suck! There’s no sex in them anymore!” Amelio had a plan to vastly simplify Apple’s product line, but by the end of the day Jobs had done that and more. From then on the focus was on birthing the iMac, the product that saved Apple from bankruptcy, and before long he had O.K.’d work that led to the iPod, the product that changed the company’s trajectory for good.Despite the occasional outbursts, a wiser, more effective Jobs was rapidly emerging. While NeXT veterans such as software chief Tevanian and hardware maven Jon Rubinstein were already on Apple’s executive staff, Jobs identified and promoted Eddy Cue out of customer service to build Apple’s online store. (Cue has run iTunes since its 2001 inception.) Jobs also discovered the design bunker of Jonathan Ive, which was located across the street from Apple’s main Infinite Loop [footnote 8] campus—a sure sign that it was seen as a lower priority than other corporate functions. In short order, Jobs moved Ive close to his own office and gave him cutting-edge equipment, his own kitchen, and hefty security to ensure secrecy.What Apple seemed to have in Jobs 2.0 was all of the features that made the young Steve Jobs great—charisma, vision, rigorous standards—with some new functionality, too. Perot had counseled that the only way investors would let him pursue cool things was by delivering consistent profits, so Jobs became the business world’s most unapologetic sandbagger; Apple has beaten Wall Street’s expectations by 30 percent, on average, since 2006, according to Bloomberg data. If he wasn’t softer, Jobs was at least more considerate; he ended company speeches with thanks to employees and their families for putting up with the grueling hours.And the simple elegance of his product vision was also coming into focus. A few months after taking over, Jobs called operations chief James M. McCluney and hardware engineering chief Rubinstein into his office and dramatically lifted a Styrofoam model of what would be the iMac out of a bowling bag. The duo reported back a few weeks later that it wouldn’t work, because they couldn’t find room for a floppy drive. Hardly missing a beat, Jobs said, “No worries. Disk drives are over the hill. CDs are going to get so cheap that no one will miss [floppies].” Says McCluney: “It was remarkable. It was a snap judgment.”Before Jobs could begin wowing consumers and delivering profits, he needed some help from a once-hated rival. Microsoft was thinking of discontinuing the Mac version of its Office suite of apps—a move that might well kill the already shrinking Mac business. Amelio had already begun talks with Microsoft that were designed to win huge patent royalty payments. Jobs—the same emotional enfant terrible of years past—had a better idea, though many of his loyalists would initially think he’d sold his soul to the devil.\\n \\nFootnotes:\\n1.

       "  'There’s been a lot of Sturm und Drang in the American corporate boardroom recently. Carol Bartz, the now former CEO of Yahoo!, was fired by the board’s chairman—by phone. Ms. Bartz thought this shabby exit etiquette and wasted no time ventilating her displeasure, telling Fortune: “These people f—– me over.” She described them as “the worst board in the country,” and—for good measure—“doofuses.” As the famous telegram put it: “F— YOU. STRONG LETTER FOLLOWS.”Refreshing as it is to hear straight talk from our business leaders, these comments could prove costly to Ms. Bartz, inasmuch as she had a “non-disparagement clause” in her contracts. Ten million dollars is a steep price for a little steam venting.Then came the “sudden removal” of Hewlett-Packard’s CEO Léo Apotheker, only a year after the untidy firing of his predecessor, Mark Hurd. Mr. Apotheker refrained from dropping the f-bomb or calling the board doofuses, but then he’s German and might have gone with doof. Instead he seemed content to walk away with an estimated $28 million to $33 million in separation fees.UBS Chief Oswald Grübel might have been fired if he hadn’t resigned, following the revelations that one of his 31-year-old traders had managed to hide $2.3 billion in losses. Will Kweku Adoboli be getting severance pay? No? Then why is he smiling in all those photographs of him in handcuffs?Firings—or to use the neater British term, sackings—are often occasions of drama. Protocol, punctilio, politesse suddenly drop, leaving Tennyson’s “Nature, red in tooth and claw.” But let’s review Ms. Bartz’s messy departure in the larger historical scheme of things, shall we: Where does a Silicon Valley chief executive being fired by phone truly rank in the pantheon?It’s a long, long list, so why don’t we confine ourselves to, say: Satan, Adam and Eve, Judas Iscariot, Nicolas Fouquet, Sir John Falstaff, Generals McClellan, Patton, and MacArthur, the Nixon White House, Don Regan, and one or two Hollywood spectacles.Starting at the top (as it were): Satan, Adam and Eve, Judas. We’re still dealing with the fallout from their dismissals. Former angel Satan, “the brightest in the sky,” attempted a corporate takeover of the heavens. But God, an experienced and canny chairman of the board, managed to hold onto his seat and down went Satan—with no golden parachute.Satan, however, was not the kind to go off and write a book about fly-fishing or do some consulting. He’s the Barry Diller of the Book of Revelation. He came back with a poison pill, forcing God to fire Adam and Eve. (Maybe He should have offered Satan that parachute after all.)The Last Supper could be viewed as Jesus’s last meeting with the 12 directors on his board. It was a productive session: Jesus instituted the Eucharist and correctly predicted that his successor would screw up three times before getting his act together. But he had to fire one of the board members, and that led to—well, you know the rest. If Jesus had offered Judas a severance package, things might have turned out very differently.Skipping ahead to the 17th century, we come to Nicolas Fouquet, Superintendent of Finances under Louis XIV. As the minister in charge of le Roi Soleil’s tax collectors, Fouquet managed to become a very, very wealthy public servant. Perhaps you’ve visited his modest country home, Vaux-le-Vicomte. It’s good to be the Superintendent of Finances. His mistake was inviting the king to Vaux-le-Vicomte for a fête that made Stephen Schwarzman’s birthday parties look like beggars banquets. Louis, whose motto was L’etat c’est moi, pas vous—tossed Fouquet into jail, where he died 19 years later.Shakespeare is full of sackings. The ones that come most vividly to my mind are Hamlet’s (unauthorized) firing of Polonius, Elsinore’s chief of staff, and Henry V’s dismissal of his old mentor and drinking buddy, Sir John Falstaff. Polonius’s severance consisted of a sword thrust through the arras. Henry terminated Falstaff with less prejudice: “I banish thee, on pain of death … not to come near our person by ten mile”—a 15th century restraining order. Kings didn’t bother much with non-disparagement clauses. Would Carol Bartz have called Henry a doofus? Methinks not.Reviewing an abbreviated roster of American military sackees, two common denominators stick out: disrespect and an excess of initiative. Civil War General George McClellan was always going on about what a dolt President Lincoln was. (He was the General Stanley McChrystal of his day, not to equate President Lincoln and Vice-President Joe Biden). Patton and MacArthur were angrily dismissed by their Commanders-in-Chief, but it added a certain luster to their legends.Nixon’s White House may have been white, but what a lot of blood was left on those walls. Watergate was Death by a Hundred Cuts and a Night of the Long Knives, the latter being the Saturday Night Massacre. Archibald Cox, Elliot Richardson, and William Ruckelshaus—a trifecta. A year later, Richard Nixon, facing the Presidential version of being fired, wisely took early retirement. Clearly, Grübel took note.I worked for a time within those walls some years later, when the 24/7 news cycle had arrived. The joke then—not thigh-slapping but funny in a grim kind of way—was that you might learn that you’d been fired by hearing it first on CNN.The sacking of Don Regan, the grumpy chief of staff of the Reagan Götterdämmerung, is the stuff of high comedy (see Richard Reeves’s superb history, President Reagan: The Triumph of Imagination):“As Regan calmed down, [Vice-President] Bush asked him about the President’s schedule …“ ‘That’s in the hands of an astrologer in San Francisco, George.’“The Vice-President looked mystified. Regan poured out his frustrations about the woman Mrs. Reagan called ‘My friend,’ Joan Quigley. ‘Good God,’ said Bush.”Moving now to Hollywood: David O. Selznick famously fired director George Cukor from Gone With the Wind after only three weeks of shooting. More recently, Walt Disney Chairman Michael Eisner fired his president, Michael Ovitz, after only a year on the job. It was nasty, but Ovitz landed softly, thanks to an estimated $170 million parachute. (About $465,000 of severance for every day. Nice work if you can get it.) Later, Eisner sacked Jeffrey Katzenberg with a package valued at an estimated quarter-billion. Eisner might have been the Boss From Hell, but he had the Midas touch when it came to severance—a quality not esteemed by Disney’s shareholders.The 2009 movie Up in the Air starred George Clooney as a corporate downsizer who flies around the country sacking entire companies at a time. At one point during the filming, director Jason Reitman decided to cast people who had actually been fired by this brutal, impersonal process.One of the most trenchant bits of dialogue in the David Mamet canon is surely the moment in Glengarry Glen Ross when the head of the real estate company, played to liquid-nitrogen-cold perfection by Alec Baldwin, tells the boys: “We’re adding a little something to this month’s sales contest. As you all know, the first prize is a Cadillac Eldorado. Anybody want to see the second prize? Second prize is a set of steak knives. Third prize is you’re fired.”There’s a term used in kayaking: if you capsize and can’t upright yourself, you do what’s called a “wet exit.” Ms. Bartz’s departure from Yahoo was an example of the wet exit. A dry exit is usually preferable, especially if it comes with $10 million.'),\n",
       " ('Cable’s ESPN Dilemma: Wildly Popular—but Costly',\n",
       "  '2011-09-29',\n",
       "  'Of the 20 most-watched programs ever on cable TV, 16 were episodes of Monday Night Football—a show that Walt Disney’s ESPN sports network didn’t begin broadcasting on cable until 2006. ESPN is also the only cable channel ever to have more than 20 million households watching a regularly scheduled program at once—a feat it’s accomplished four times. That ratings strength is the reason most cable operators believe carrying the world’s No. 1 sports network is essential to keeping 99 million U.S. pay-TV subscribers shelling out monthly fees.Now system operators are being forced to figure out how much subscribers are willing to pay for sports—and at what point they’ll throw in the towel. In early September, ESPN announced a deal to broadcast Monday Night Football for eight more years. It will pay $1.9 billion a year to the National Football League, a 73 percent increase, says a person familiar with the contract details who is not authorized to speak on the record. While ESPN says it won’t add a surcharge for the new deal, the network will almost certainly make companies such as Comcast, Time Warner Cable, and DirecTV pay more for programming when contracts come up for renewal. “We’re concerned that the rising cost of cable programming, especially sports programming, is starting to price some consumers out of the market,” says Jerald L. Kent, chief executive officer of Suddenlink Communications, the seventh-largest U.S. cable carrier.Already facing competition from cheaper Web rivals, cable and satellite operators are in a bind. If they pass on the costs to customers, they risk more defections. If they drop the hot network, they also stand to lose subscribers. Frets Matthew M. Polka, president of the American Cable Assn., which represents 900 small and midsize cable systems: “ESPN can force costs to customers indiscriminately because they know the cable and satellite operators feel like they have to offer sports to be competitive.”There are signs price hikes are hurting pay-TV subscriptions. Last quarter the six largest publicly traded U.S. cable and satellite-TV providers lost about 580,000 customers, the biggest decline in history, according to company and Bloomberg data. ESPN Executive Vice-President Ed Durso says there’s little evidence a significant number of subscribers is dropping service. “The cable operator industry tends to understate the true value of their video product,” he says. “Compared to other forms of entertainment, the price value component of cable is extremely reasonable.”Besides Disney, companies including Time Warner, News Corp., and Viacom are charging cable companies more for programming, particularly sports. NBCUniversal paid $4.38 billion for TV rights to the next four Olympics. Comcast, which owns 51 percent of NBCUniversal, has said it plans to charge higher distribution fees to make the deal profitable.ESPN charges cable operators an average $4.69 a month for each subscriber that gets the channel, up from $4.34 last year, according to researcher SNL Kagan. Cable networks such as CNN or TBS charge less than a dollar, says Kagan’s Derek Baine. ESPN’s average annual price increase to pay-TV providers will likely exceed 10 percent after the new Monday Night Football deal, says Baine.Paying more for ESPN is only part of the problem. Disney charges distribution fees and collects ad revenue from its other channels, including ESPN2, ESPN Classic, ABC Family, and Disney Channel. To get ESPN, pay-TV systems must take bundles of channels, including some less popular. ESPN and ESPN2 account for almost 20 percent of the wholesale cost of the average pay-TV subscription, says Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Craig Moffett.“Cable operators are typically at the mercy of the large content providers, who tie carriage of smaller-niche channels to carriage of the ‘must-haves’ like ESPN,” explains Ryan Vineyard, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. The fees programmers charged cable channels jumped to $24.9 billion in 2010, up 90 percent from 2004, according to Bloomberg data. Now prices are set to go even higher as content providers negotiate new deals that charge cable companies extra for the right to send movies and TV shows to their subscribers’ laptops and mobile devices via the Web.For years, pay-TV subscribers have pushed for the option to pay less for only a few channels of their choice, instead of basic packages that now can include hundreds of channels. Yet the programmers’ channel-bundling rules have made it difficult for pay-TV providers to offer such à la carte options. “If I could offer high-cost channels like ESPN as stand-alone channels, à la carte, I’d do it,” says Suddenlink’s Kent.Disney has no interest in selling ESPN as a stand-alone service. Fewer subscribers would watch, so ad revenue would fall and Disney would lose the $4.69 it now receives for each basic cable subscriber, says Durso. Besides, he notes, “For cable operators, the best subscriber they have is an ESPN customer, because ESPN customers buy more high-speed data and buy more HDTV than any other customer.”Disney would likely have to charge about $30 just for ESPN to make up for lost advertising and affiliate revenue it gets from the network and the networks it bundles with ESPN, Moffett says. The end result would be consumers paying more money for just a few channels than they pay for hundreds today.Polka of the cable association says it makes more sense to relegate ESPN to a “sports tier,” where sports fans can pay extra for it and other customers can opt out. Time Warner Cable is testing such a product in New York without ESPN for $39.95 for 12 months and $49.95 thereafter, vs. a standard cable package with ESPN for $68. Still, should the cheaper package catch fire and become the most or second most popular Time Warner Cable offering, a provision in ESPN’s contract would require the cable operator to include the costly sports network in that trimmed-down package—eliminating the reason it was introduced in the first place. “ESPN has demonstrated its value as part of basic cable for more than 30 years,” says Durso. “There isn’t any case that can be made for putting ESPN on a sports tier.”The bottom line: Cable operators worry that Disney, which got 68 percent of operating income last quarter from cable networks, will charge more for ESPN.'),\n",

       "  '2011-09-22',\n",
       "  'For most of its decade as a public company, Netflix got a lot of things right. Consumers flocked to its original mail-order DVD service, a bold, disruptive move that helped push Blockbuster into bankruptcy. When Netflix added online movie-watching in January 2007, the strategy offered consumers flexibility and won a loyal following. Key to making it all work was Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings’ outmaneuvering of the Hollywood studios, first undercutting their home-video sales with an all-you-can-eat monthly rental price for DVDs, then buying up digital rights to movies and TV shows from the weakest players. The result: Netflix shares almost doubled in 2009, more than tripled in 2010, and by mid-July had risen an additional 70 percent, to $304 per share at its peak.Now Hastings faces what may be his most difficult task yet: reigniting growth after a series of pricing and other missteps that has angered and confused consumers and spooked shareholders. It started with the July 12 introduction of a pricing plan that translated into a 60 percent increase for 24 million subscribers who wanted discs and streaming. Then the cable channel Starz broke off talks to renew a key online deal to supply movies and TV shows—leaving customers with the prospect of paying more for less. Finally, Hastings apologized in a blog post, only to drop a bombshell that the DVD service would be separated from streaming and renamed Qwikster, with its own website and billing. By Sept. 20, Netflix shares had plunged 57 percent from their peak.Despite the erratic way the transition has played out so far, media experts say Hastings’ risky changes make sense strategically. “You’ve got to give Reed credit,” says Paul Saffo, a managing director at Discern Analytics. “He knows Netflix absolutely has to flee into the future with digital delivery. The problem is, not all customers have come to that yet.”Hastings has to manage a business model shift that has tripped up other former technology highfliers such as Netscape, AOL, and Myspace. To pay the rising sums Hollywood is demanding for online rights to movies and TV shows, Netflix needs to keep revenue flowing from the DVD rental business even as it expects industry revenue to decline as much as 10 percent a year—Hastings’ own guesstimate based on the music industry’s contraction. The cost of its new deals to acquire content for streaming has so far this year increased nearly eightfold from 2010, to $804.9 million. The company has $1.3 billion in content fees payable over the next five years, up from $68.7 million three years earlier. It will generate $344 million in cash flow this year, estimates Barclay Capital’s Anthony DiClemente, a big part of it from the 14 million subscribers who get DVDs.So over the next few months, Hastings will step up marketing of that legacy business, “something we haven’t done for many quarters,” he said in a July letter to shareholders. “Our goal is to keep DVD as healthy as possible for as many years as possible.” Streaming movies online, unburdened by DVD warehouses and costly postal fees, is the real prize. That business generates a hefty 65 percent gross profit margin, according to Michael Pachter, an analyst with Wedbush Securities, compared with the 37 percent he estimates for DVDs. Netflix doesn’t provide detailed financial information for the two businesses.Until now, Netflix had done an elegant job of avoiding the mistakes of Blockbuster, the video rental chain that went bankrupt last year because it failed to let go of its legacy retail business and move online, Saffo says. Netflix’s mistake was failing to manage subscribers’ expectations, he says: “The only surprises you should give your customers are good surprises. Loyalty is a two-edged sword.”Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson says Hastings may be moving too fast because his library of online videos and movies isn’t enough to satisfy consumers: “I understand why they’re making this move toward streaming from a long-term perspective, but the only way they will now be able to make investors believe in them, and subscribers continue to be attracted, is to have a waterfall of new content in the next few months.”Hollywood knows that Netflix needs product more than ever, and the price for its next deal with a studio or video service will likely dwarf previous ones, says Frank Biondi, former president of Universal Studios and one of HBO’s founders. “It was easy to get a good deal when the studios didn’t know just how big Netflix was going to be,” he says.CBS just signed a two-year agreement that provides Netflix only about 7 percent of its TV library, including episodes of Star Trek and Cheers, CEO Leslie Moonves said at a Sept. 20 investor conference. At the same conference, Chase Carey, president of Fox parent News Corp., suggested future deals could be increasingly lucrative for studios. “There are real opportunities for us to take advantage [of],” he said.Netflix’s bigger problem may be other deep-pocketed players crowding into streaming. Amazon has signed 5 million users to its $79 Prime shipping service, which also offers thousands of films and TV shows online at no additional cost. Google is prowling Hollywood for content and is said to be among those interested in buying Hulu, the online video service owned by Disney’s ABC, NBCUniversal’s NBC, and Fox.Still, the competitors Hastings says he fears most are big media, cable, and satellite operators who already have relationships with consumers. Time Warner’s HBO currently delivers movies and TV shows for free online to its pay-TV subscribers, and satellite operator Dish launched a service of its own after acquiring Blockbuster, which gave it contracts with most of Hollywood. “Our task is to consistently improve the quality of our service and stay two steps ahead,” Hastings said in his July letter. Easier said than done.— With assistance by Andy FixmerThe bottom line: Netflix faces increasingly high content costs as it shifts its business further toward online video delivery.'),\n",

       "  'As a college student, Jordan Geddis took cable TV for granted. MTV, Comedy Central, and ESPN were just part of the dorm tab at Syracuse University. Even when she moved off campus, Geddis split the bill with roommates. Now, on her own in a tough economy, the 25-year-old General Dynamics engineer in Groton, Conn., no longer pays. “When I had cable I followed a couple shows, but the rest was garbage to me,” Geddis says. “Online I can watch the few programs I actually care about.”With more young adults tuning out this TV season, the industry is confronting a generation of viewers who say they won’t pay the typical $75 monthly cable or satellite bill. Nielsen, whose TV ratings influence ad rates, in May cut the estimated number of U.S. TV households by 1 percent, to 114.7 million, the first drop since 1990. College towns such as Boston, Madison, Wisc., and Austin, Tex., posted some of the biggest declines, suggesting some fans of Family Guy are watching on Hulu Plus or Netflix for $7.99 a month, a fraction of a cable bill.The impact of cord-cutting was masked earlier by rising cable-TV subscriptions, says Jeff Gaspin, former chairman of NBC Entertainment. No longer. “With a decrease in pay-TV subscribers and Nielsen’s reduction in households,” Gaspin says, “the effect is more pronounced.” The six largest publicly traded cable- and satellite-TV providers announced last month a combined loss of about 580,000 customers in the second quarter—the biggest decline in history. Industry analysts blame a weak job market and rising pay-TV bills.It’s also because of the growing appetite for Internet-delivered TV programming among younger viewers. To many of them, there’s no difference between watching Gossip Girl online or on the tube, says David F. Poltrack, chief research officer at CBS. College-age audiences are relying more on laptops than TVs to watch favorite shows, a function of TV prices and less help from Mom and Dad, Poltrack says. “College rooms are small, and TV sets are expensive,” he says. “A cable package can be a significant expense on a college budget.”Programmers are responding by delaying free Web access to shows and, for the TV season that started in mid-September, piling more commercials into programs viewed online. When Hulu shows new episodes of Fox’s Raising Hope, ABC’s Modern Family, and other programs from the networks, for example, one more commercial will be added per half hour, a 20 percent jump. To discourage cord-cutting, News Corp.’s Fox blocks Web viewers from seeing programs for eight days after their broadcast, unless they are verified pay-TV customers. Walt Disney-owned ABC is weighing a similar measure, people familiar with the network’s plans say. Cable programmers such as Disney’s ESPN and Time Warner’s CNN and HBO are working to keep subscribers by letting them watch online via computer or mobile device.When students watch sports, however, increasingly they gather in common rooms with TVs, Poltrack says. Geddis meets friends at sports bars or uses unauthorized websites that stream ESPN and other sports networks. “Those sites are low-quality, but if you don’t want to go out, they’re available,” she says. “I’m a Chicago sports fan living on the East Coast, so I watch these sites at home a lot on my laptop.”More online options are becoming available. Major League Baseball and the National Basketball Assn. offer subscriptions to out-of-market games, and this year’s U.S. Open tennis matches were shown online for free. If HBO’s True Blood or another show isn’t available for streaming, Geddis often buys the programs from Apple’s iTunes or another online media store. She links her laptop to her home TV to watch programs and plans to permanently connect her parents’ old computer. “I can’t imagine ever again being interested in cable TV,” Geddis says.The bottom line: U.S. TV households have fallen this year by 1 percent, to 114.7 million. That’s the first drop since 1990 and a bad augur for cable providers.'),\n",

       "  'The technicians at SecureAlert’s monitoring center in Salt Lake City sit in front of computer screens filled with multicolored dots. Each dot represents someone on parole or probation wearing one of the company’s location-reporting ankle cuffs. As the people move around a city, their dots move around the map. “It looks a bit like an animated gumball machine,” says Steven Florek, SecureAlert’s vice-president of offender insights and knowledge management. As long as the gumballs don’t go where they’re not supposed to, all is well.The company works with law enforcement agencies around the U.S. to keep track of about 15,000 ex-cons, meaning it must collect and analyze billions of GPS signals transmitted by the cuffs each day. The more traditional part of the work consists of making sure that people under house arrest stay in their houses. But advances in the way information is collected and sorted mean SecureAlert isn’t just watching; the company says it can actually predict when a crime is about to go down. If that sounds like the “pre-cogs”—crime prognosticators—in the movie Minority Report, Florek thinks so, too. He calls SecureAlert’s newest capability “pre-crime” detection.Using data from the ankle cuffs and other sources, SecureAlert identifies patterns of suspicious behavior. A person convicted of domestic violence, for example, might get out of jail and set up a law-abiding routine. Quite often, though, SecureAlert’s technology sees such people backslide and start visiting the restaurants or schools or other places their victims frequent. “We know they’re looking to force an encounter,” Florek says. If the person gets too close for comfort, he says, “an alarm goes off and a flashing siren appears on the screen.” The system doesn’t go quite as far as Minority Report, where the cops break down doors and blow away the perpetrators before they perpetrate. Rather, the system can call an offender through a two-way cellphone attached to the ankle cuff to ask what the person is doing, or set off a 95-decibel shriek as a warning to others. More typically, the company will notify probation officers or police about the suspicious activity and have them investigate. Presumably with weapons holstered. “It’s like a strategy game,” Florek says. (Before Bloomberg Businessweek went to press, Florek left the company for undisclosed reasons.)It didn’t used to be that a company the size of SecureAlert, with about $16 million in annual revenue, could engage in such a real-world chess match. For decades, only Fortune 500-scale corporations and three-letter government agencies had the money and resources to pull off this kind of data crunching. Wal-Mart Stores is famous for using data analysis to adjust its inventory levels and prices. FedEx earned similar respect for tweaking its delivery routes, while airlines and telecommunications companies used this technology to pinpoint and take care of their best customers. But even at the most sophisticated corporations, data analytics was often a cumbersome, ad hoc affair. Companies would pile information in “data warehouses,” and if executives had a question about some demographic trend, they had to supplicate “data priests” to tease the answers out of their costly, fragile systems. “This resulted in a situation where the analytics were always done looking in the rearview mirror,” says Paul Maritz, chief executive officer of VMware. “You were reasoning over things to find out what happened six months ago.”In the early 2000s a wave of startups made it possible to gather huge volumes of data and analyze it in record speed—à la SecureAlert. A retailer such as Macy’s that once pored over last season’s sales information could shift to looking instantly at how an e-mail coupon for women’s shoes played out in different regions. “We have a banking client that used to need four days to make a decision on whether or not to trade a mortgage-backed security,” says Charles W. Berger, CEO of ParAccel, a data analytics startup founded in 2005 that powers SecureAlert’s pre-crime operation. “They do that in seven minutes now.”Now a second wave of startups is finding ways to use cheap but powerful servers to analyze new categories of data such as blog posts, videos, photos, tweets, DNA sequences, and medical images. “The old days were about asking, ‘What is the biggest, smallest, and average?’\\u2009” says Michael Olson, CEO of startup Cloudera. “Today it’s, ‘What do you like? Who do you know?’ It’s answering these complex questions.”The big bang in data analytics occurred in 2006 with the release of an open-source system called Hadoop. The technology was created by a software consultant named Doug Cutting, who had been examining a series of technical papers released by Google. The papers described how the company spread tremendous amounts of information across its data centers and probed that pool of data for answers to queries. Where traditional data warehouses crammed as much information as possible on a few expensive computers, Google chopped up databases into bite-size chunks and sprinkled them among tens of thousands of cheap computers. The result was a lower-cost and higher-capacity system that lots of people can use at the same time. Google uses the technology throughout its operations. Its systems study billions of search results, match them to the first letters of a query, take a guess at what people are looking for, and display suggestions as they type. You can see the bite-size nature of the technology in action on Google Maps as tiny tiles come together to form a full map.Cutting created Hadoop to mimic Google’s technology so the rest of the world could have a way to sift through massive data sets quickly and cheaply. (Hadoop was the name of his son’s toy elephant.) The software first took off at Web companies such as Yahoo! and Facebook and then spread far and wide, with Walt Disney, the New York Times, Samsung, and hundreds of others starting their own projects. Cloudera, where Cutting, 48, now works, makes its own version of Hadoop and has sales partnerships with Hewlett-Packard and Dell.Dozens of startups are trying to develop easier-to-use versions of Hadoop. For example, Datameer, in San Mateo, Calif., has built an Excel-like dashboard that allows regular business people, instead of data priests, to pose questions. “For 20 years you had limited amounts of computing and storage power and could only ask certain things,” says Datameer CEO Stefan Groschupf. “Now you just dump everything in there and ask whatever you want.” Top venture capital firms Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and Redpoint Ventures have backed Datameer, while Accel Partners, Greylock Partners, and In-Q-Tel, the investment arm of the CIA, have helped finance Cloudera.Past technology worked with data that fell neatly into rows and columns—purchase dates, prices, the location of a store. Amazon.com, for instance, would use traditional systems to track how many people bought a certain type of camera and for what price. Hadoop can handle data that don’t fit into spreadsheets. That ability, combined with Hadoop’s speedy divide-and-conquer approach to data, lets users get answers to questions they couldn’t even ask before. Retailers can dig into not just what people bought but why they bought it. Amazon can (and does) analyze its website logs to see what other items people look at before they buy that camera, how long they look at them, whether certain colors on a Web page generate more sales—and synthesize all that into real-time intelligence. Are they telling their friends about that camera? Is some new model poised to be the next big hit? “These insights don’t come super easily, but the information is there, and we do have the machine power now to process it and search for it,” says James Markarian, chief technology officer at data specialist Informatica.Take the case of U.S. Xpress Enterprises, one of the largest private trucking companies. Through a device installed in the cabs of its 10,000-truck fleet, U.S. Xpress can track a driver’s location, how many times the driver has braked hard in the last few hours, if he sent a text message to the customer saying he would be late, and how long he rested. U.S. Xpress pays particular attention to the fuel economy of each driver, separating out the “guzzlers from the misers,” says Timothy Leonard, U.S. Xpress CTO. Truckers keep the engines running and the air conditioning on after they’ve pulled over for the night. “If you have a 10-hour break, we want your AC going for the first two hours at 70 degrees so you can go to sleep,” says Leonard. “After that, we want it back up to 78 or 79 degrees.” By adjusting the temperature, U.S. Xpress has lowered annual fuel consumption by 62 gallons per truck, which works out to a total of about $24 million per year. Less numerically, the company’s systems also analyze drivers’ tweets and blog posts. “We have a sentiment dashboard that monitors how they are feeling,” Leonard says. “If we see they hate something, we can respond with some new software or policies in a few hours.” The monitoring may come off as Big Brotherish, but U.S. Xpress sees it as key to keeping its drivers from quitting. (Driver turnover is a chronic issue in the trucking business.)How are IBM and the other big players in the data warehousing business responding to all this? In the usual way: They’re buying startups. Last year, IBM bought Netezza for $1.7 billion. HP, EMC, and Teradata have also acquired data analytics companies in the past 24 months.It’s not going too far to say that data analytics has even gotten hip. The San Francisco offices of startup Splunk have all the of-the-moment accoutrements you’d find at Twitter or Zynga. The engineers work in what amounts to a giant living room with pinball machines, foosball tables, and Hello Kitty-themed cubes. Weekday parties often break out—during a recent visit, it was Mexican fiesta. Employees were wearing sombreros and fake moustaches while a dude near the tequila bar played the bongos.Splunk got its start as a type of nuts-and-bolts tool in data centers, giving administrators a way to search through data tied to the low-level operations of computers and software. The company indexes “machine events”—the second-by-second records produced by computing devices to keep track of their actions. This could include records of every time a server stores information, or it could be the length of a cell phone call and what type of handset was used. Splunk helps companies search through this morass, looking for events that caused problems or stood out as unusual. “We can see someone visit a shopping website from a certain computer, see that they got an error message while on the lady’s lingerie page, see how many times they tried to log in, where they went after, and what machine in some far-off data center caused the problem,” says Erik Swan, CTO and co-founder of Splunk. While it started as troubleshooting software for data centers, the company has morphed into an analysis tool that can be aimed at fine-tuning fraud detection systems at credit-card companies and measuring the success of online ad campaigns.A few blocks away from Splunk’s office are the more sedate headquarters of IRhythm Technologies, a medical device startup. IRhythm makes a type of oversize, plastic band-aid called the Zio Patch that helps doctors detect cardiac problems before they become fatal. Patients affix the Zio Patch to their chests for two weeks to measure their heart activity. The patients then mail the devices back to IRhythm’s offices, where a technician feeds the information into Amazon’s cloud computing service. Patients typically wear rivals’ much chunkier devices for just a couple of days and remove them when they sleep or shower—which happen to be when heart abnormalities often manifest. The upside of the waterproof Zio Patch is the length of time that people wear it—but 14 days is a whole lot of data.IRhythm’s Hadoop system chops the 14-day periods into chunks and analyzes them with algorithms. Unusual activity gets passed along to technicians who flag worrisome patterns to doctors. For quality control of the device itself, IRhythm uses Splunk. The system monitors the strength of the Zio Patch’s recording signals, whether hot weather affects its adhesiveness to the skin, or how long a patient actually wore the device. On the Zio Patch manufacturing floor, IRhythm discovered that operations at some workstations were taking longer than expected. It used Splunk to go back to the day when the problems cropped up and discovered a computer glitch that was hanging up the operation.Mark Day, IRhythm’s vice-president of research and development, says he’s able to fine-tune his tiny startup’s operations the way a world-class manufacturer like Honda Motor or Dell could a couple years ago. Even if he could have afforded the old-line data warehouses, they were too inflexible to provide much help. “The problem with those systems was that you don’t know ahead of time what problems you will face,” Day says. “Now, we just adapt as things come up.”At SecureAlert, Florek says that despite the much-improved tools, extracting useful meaning from data still requires effort—and in his line of work, sensitivity. If some ankle-cuff-wearing parolee wanders out-of-bounds, there’s a human in the process to make a judgment call. “We are constantly tuning our system to achieve a balance between crying wolf and catching serious situations,” he says. “Sometimes a guy just goes to a location because he got a new girlfriend.”'),\n",

       "  'Bruce Willis’s mob hit man travels to the future in next year’s movie Looper. Thanks to backing from Beijing-based DMG Entertainment, that future is in China. DMG funded the production on condition that the location was moved from France and a role was written especially for Chinese actress Xu Qing. By jumping through these hoops, the movie now qualifies as a Chinese co-production, exempting it from the nation’s 20-film-per-year import quota and allowing foreign backers to keep three times as much in box office receipts. “We are trying to be relevant to a significant market,” says DMG Chief Executive Officer Dan Mintz. “The industry is growing like a rocket ship.”Looper is one of a wave of Sino-U.S. productions as Hollywood looks to expand in China, which is adding more than 1,400 cinema screens a year. The 2010 remake of Karate Kid, starring Jackie Chan and Jaden Smith, was produced by Sony Pictures’ Columbia TriStar and state-owned China Film Group. Fox Searchlight Pictures and Beijing-based IDG China Media teamed up for Snow Flower and the Secret Fan. “Everyone is coming in to join the bandwagon,” says Hong Kong-based Bill Kong, who co-produced the 2000 hit Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. “Ten years ago, if you made $3 million in China, you would be jumping up and down. Today it’s more like one or two hundred million.”Box office receipts in China grew 64 percent last year, to 10.2 billion yuan ($1.6 billion), according to the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television. While that’s a fraction of the $10.6 billion in U.S. receipts, according to Box Office Mojo, China is a huge potential growth market for Hollywood. Its cinema-building will more than double the number of screens by 2015, from 6,200 at the end of 2010, says Mintz.James Wang, 41, and his older brother Dennis made their first movie, the comedy Party A, Party B, in the mid-1990s. It earned $4 million, “a blockbuster at the time,” he says. Last year, Wang, CEO of Huayi Brothers Media, China’s largest independent film producer, released Aftershock, a Feng Xiaogang film about the 1976 Tangshan earthquake. It made $105 million.Beijing is using its quota system to prevent the spread of foreign culture and promote its fledgling domestic film industry. “China is keen on promoting its soft power,” says Shen Dingli, a professor at the Center for American Studies at Shanghai’s Fudan University. Joint film productions serve “the political purpose to promote our culture and systems with Hollywood’s competence.”DMG is raising $300 million for a fund to help U.S. film franchises qualify as co-productions. To gain that status, films must be licensed by China’s media regulator, which sets rules on the film’s finances, its location, and the percentage of Chinese stars in the cast. Among the benefits: A co-production gets to keep 47 percent of box office receipts, vs. as little as 13.5 percent for imported films. Kong turned The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor into a co-production with NBCUniversal’s Universal Studios and China Film Group four years ago. Filming took place in China, and Jet Li and Isabella Leong were among the Chinese actors added to the cast. “It wasn’t a great movie, but it utilized a big American franchise in China,” Kong says. “The time will come when there are more.”Huayi’s Wang recently teamed with Thomas Tull, founder of Legendary Pictures, whose hits include The Dark Knight and The Hangover, to start a venture called Legendary East. The unit will make films in China targeting international and local audiences, financed in part through the sale of a 50 percent stake to Hong Kong-based Paul Y. Engineering Group for $220.5 million. West Hollywood-based Relativity Media, one of the financiers of Cowboys & Aliens, on Aug. 14 announced a $100 million joint venture with Huaxia Film Distribution to produce films and TV shows in China.Getting the formula right isn’t easy. Some U.S. hits have struck gold in China, with Avatar grossing $216 million in ticket sales. By contrast, the Chinese version of High School Musical, made by Huayi with Walt Disney in 2010, earned less than $155,000. Chinese audiences, says Wang, don’t like musicals.The bottom line: Hollywood studios are teaming up with Chinese film companies to bypass profit-restricting quotas on foreign films on the mainland.'),\n",

       "  'Yahoo! has cranked out corporate drama for the better part of its decade-long slide. So consider Carol Bartz’s Sept. 6 exit the company’s equivalent of MacBeth—grueling, emotional, bloody, and riveting. In two meetings held over the summer, the company’s eight independent directors concluded that the chief executive officer should go after 30 months on the job. Roy Bostock, Yahoo’s chairman, scheduled a meeting with Bartz in a New York area airport to deliver the bad news, but stormy weather intervened, according to a person familiar with the day’s events. Bostock was forced to fire her by phone. A few minutes later, Bartz, widely known as an expressive and sometimes volatile executive, sent an e-mail to Yahoo’s 13,000 employees. “I am very sad to tell you that I’ve just been fired over the phone by Yahoo’s chairman,” she wrote. “It has been my pleasure to work with all of you.” Shortly afterward, the company disabled her account.Bartz’s two-year transition from savior to outcast sums ups Yahoo’s own transformation over the last decade. The company, one of the dominant players of the Web 1.0 era, has struggled to retain its employees, expand its core business, and even find an identity. (Whether it’s a media or a technology company is a constantly debated question.) Now, more than three years after it turned down a lucrative acquisition offer from Microsoft, Sunnyvale (Calif.)-based Yahoo is facing yet another crisis. The company has appointed Chief Financial Officer Tim Morse as interim CEO and is planning to hire strategic advisers to study its next move. That is likely to involve selling its valuable stakes in two highflying Asian Internet companies, Alibaba and Yahoo! Japan, instead of putting the company up for sale, according to a person directly familiar with the thinking of the Yahoo board who is not authorized to speak on the record.Bartz’s tenure was decidedly mixed. She streamlined the staff, jettisoned side businesses like the help-wanted site Hotjobs, and outsourced the expensive and losing search battle to Microsoft. By all the measures that matter to investors, though, Bartz was a disappointment. The stock has remained at around $13 a share, and over the last year Bartz has feuded publicly with a chief ally, Jack Ma. The Alibaba Group CEO spooked Yahoo investors when he spun off one of his company’s most valuable assets, the payment tool Alipay, without compensating Yahoo shareholders. In July, Yahoo missed its second-quarter revenue target, an unexpected failure that Bartz blamed on turnover in the crucial display advertising sales team. “The slowdown in their display business is simply from her inability to keep the display team together over the last 18 months,” says Ross Sandler, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. “She’s responsible for the underperformance in that business.”Armchair investment bankers in Silicon Valley are now running to their Twitter accounts to speculate about Yahoo’s next move. Analysts believe bids to buy Yahoo are possible from the likes of Microsoft, Disney, and News Corp.. Its core media and communications properties, such as Yahoo! Finance and Yahoo! Mail, still attract 178 million visitors a month. One fanciful scenario has private equity firms packaging AOL and Yahoo, creating a Web advertising behemoth. All those companies declined to comment.The likelier outcome is that Yahoo sells its Asian stakes and uses that capital to make a large acquisition, according to the person familiar with the board’s thinking. (It’s among the companies bidding for Web video site Hulu.) Of course, Yahoo has tried—and failed—in the past to buy streaking businesses, including a bid for Groupon in 2010.With more dynamic competitors always ready to steal advertisers, employees, and promising acquisition targets, deteriorating Internet companies tend to see their tailspins only accelerate. To avoid that, Bartz’s successor will have to start by finally solving Yahoo’s identity crisis, says former Yahoo executive Dave Goldberg, now CEO of Web firm SurveyMonkey. “Yahoo needs to be more focused,” he says. “But until you can answer the question ‘What is Yahoo?’ it’s hard to say what you should keep and what you should get rid of.”The bottom line: Yahoo is likely to sell off its valuable Asian properties and make a high-profile acquisition with the proceeds.'),\n",

       "  'As if the U.S. Postal Service weren’t already in enough financial trouble, a growing number of startups are about to make its future even more uncertain. They’re trying to lure one of its main revenue sources—the nearly 48 billion bills, statements, account notices, and offers that companies send to households every year—into the electronic realm. That could make the USPS’s $3.1 billion third-quarter loss seem like small change. The companies aim to do so with secure online services that, unlike e-mail, are inaccessible to spammers and allow consumers to receive, organize, and respond to important correspondence all in one digital place. Matt Swain, associate director at research firm InfoTrends, calls the technology “a potential game-changer.”Zumbox, a Los Angeles firm launched in December 2009, was the first digital mail service out of the gate. With $17.7 million in venture funding from private investors including former Walt Disney Chief Executive Officer Michael D. Eisner, the company is creating a digital mailbox for every street address in the country. (Ironically, it’s using a freely available USPS database to do so.) When customers sign up, Zumbox mails them a PIN which they must use to register their account, a step that verifies the link between the virtual Zumbox and the real-world address. That assures mail senders that information is going to the right household. Users can then access their Zumbox, free of charge, to receive and store electronic mail, pay bills, and opt out of paper mailings. “There’s sort of an inevitability about the migration of the mail to digital,” says Zumbox CEO John Payne.The inevitable can’t come quickly enough for some companies. In 2010, for the first time, households reported paying more bills electronically than by mail, according to the most recent USPS Household Diary Study. But only about 15 percent of consumer bills and statements are delivered exclusively online. Businesses spend about $30 billion each year printing, collating, and mailing documents, and a typical bill costs a company anywhere from 70¢ to a dollar to deliver. Zumbox charges senders as little as 20¢. “Mailing is all about the cost of postage,” says Frank Delfer, chief technology officer of DST Output, an El Dorado Hills (Calif.) company that processes 2.3 billion paper bills, statements, and financial documents annually for large companies. DST started offering Zumbox to its customers in early August. “Digital postal mail lets companies save money compared to the way they’re doing it today.”Zumbox already has competition. In January, Pitney Bowes, a maker of postage meters and machines, announced plans to offer a service called Volly that, like Zumbox, will create a digital mailbox tied to a customer’s mailing address. Manilla, a startup owned by Hearst that launched in February, characterizes itself as a free personal account management service. It can’t actually receive mail as Zumbox does, but once users give Manilla the credentials for their business accounts, the site provides an organized view of all their bills, finances, travel rewards programs, and subscriptions, along with payment reminders. Doxo, begun in October 2010 and backed in part by Bezos Expeditions, which manages Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos’s personal investments, operates similarly to Manilla but also allows users to upload and store documents.All the services are free to consumers and make money by charging mailers a per-document fee when customers agree to paperless billing. They also promise to do away with junk mail, since spammers won’t be able to infiltrate the gated electronic system set up by the digital mail services. That doesn’t mean the mailboxes will be entirely annoyance-free. Zumbox says it plans to allow verified marketers to send mail—otherwise known as spam—but that customers can filter those messages and opt out of unwanted marketing. And while no online service is completely impervious to being hacked, the digital mail providers have invested in the same level of encryption and security that banks use.Right now, the various digital mailbox services are rushing to form partnerships with companies that send out bills and statements, while building up their user base. Manilla is taking out two-page spreads in Hearst magazines such as Cosmopolitan and Redbook, and Zumbox has launched a million-dollar sweepstakes to get people to sign up and refer friends. Pitney Bowes has promised to commit 5¢ to 10¢ per share, or about $20 million, for market development of Volly.Swain, the InfoTrends analyst, expects more companies to jump into the digital mailbox business.

       "  'Seeing dozens of women in scallop-shell bikini tops struggling to force their legs into latex tails inside Las Vegas cabanas does not ruin the magic of mermaids. At least not for the small group of men who’ve come to the Silverton Casino, just off the Strip, for Mer-Con, the Comic-Con of mythical aquatic creatures. Like many of the men at the Aug. 12 convention—other than the old guy playing Poseidon and a smattering of effeminate mermen—Thom Shouse is dressed like a pirate. Or at least kind of like a pirate. “I’m not a pirate,” clarifies Shouse, wearing a poufy white shirt and a red bandana. “I don’t have any skulls and crossbones on me.” Shouse, it turns out, is a businessman of a different sort. “I’m the minder of mermaids. I have mermaids that get treasure for me. Pirates are my friends because I get mermaids to be with them and tell them stories and just be pretty.”When he is not pimping out mermaids, Shouse is a special effects artist specializing in amphibious women. After creating the tail for the 1984 mermaid epic, Splash, Shouse went on to become the world’s top designer of bespoke urethane tails. And business has never been better: Shouse, who claims he believes mermaids are real, says there’s currently a six-month wait for one of his multi-thousand-dollar creations. That’s because mermaids are about to swamp vampires and zombies as supernatural rainmakers in popular culture.Building off the buzz from this year’s installment of the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise—which featured a plethora of bad-ass, sailor-drowning mermaids played by models—mermaid-fueled projects are piling up. Twilight author Stefanie Meyer says her next book is all mermaid. Joe Wright, who directed Atonement, is planning a live-action, dark version of Hans Christian Andersen’s The Little Mermaid; Tobey Maguire is producing a rival, also dark, also live-action Little Mermaid. In June, Disneyland launched a new Little Mermaid ride and will add one to Disney World in 2012. Photographer Mark Anderson is releasing a book—available as an iPhone app—called M: Mermaids of Hollywood, that features Anna Faris, the Kardashians, Kristen Bell, and others in tails. Carolyn Turgeon, author of Mermaid: A Twist on the Classic Tale, has agreed to run a new magazine, Mermaids & Mythology. The Australian kids’ show H20: Just Add Water is like Hannah Montana with fins. “Mermaids are great,” says Shouse, who created a tail for a recent Panda Express ad. “They can sell hair-care products, skin-care products, seafood!”Shouse may seem to have a jump on the competition, but he’s hardly alone; the true beneficiaries of the mermaid bull market are small business owners who cornered the mermaid market before there actually was one. Eric Ducharme, who lives near Tampa, makes about seven latex tails a month for $500 to $700 and since December has created 25 silicone ones for $1,600 to $5,000, including one for Lady Gaga. The Weeki Wachee Springs Underwater Theater, also near Tampa, started its mermaid shows in 1947. In danger of closing just a few years ago, it’s now hosting sold-out camps for adults who want to swim with tails.With a little luck these adults can even turn pro. When Erin St. Blaine lost her dot-com job in 2001, she and her fellow tech-bust-victim husband, Darrell, formed Fire Pixie Entertainment in Fremont, Calif. In addition to fire eaters and belly dancers, they’ve hired four pro mermaids to perform at parties. Darrell, who stands by the pool dressed like a pirate as Erin swims in her tail, is not surprised his wife got in on the fad. “She’ll want to be an astronaut next year,” he says. “Or drive a fire truck.”Other mermaids, however, can’t imagine doing anything else. Hannah Mermaid (née Fraser), the Angelina Jolie of the tail business, is a delicate, blonde Australian model who radiates a hippie calm. Fraser went pro eight years ago and performs at the Atlantis Resort in the Bahamas one week each month. When she’s not there, she’s appearing in TV ads for Skyy Vodka, doing events for Omega, or welcoming two new manatees to the Sydney Aquarium.At Mer-Con, Hannah Mermaid holds court outside by the pool at the Silverton, posing for adoring fans, members of the media, and a few borderline creepy dudes. Organizers chose the Silverton partly because it’s got a 117,000-gallon aquarium in the Mermaid Restaurant & Lounge, where former synchronized swimmers put on mermaid shows daily. The tank is situated just a few feet from a mermaid art gallery where you can buy a portrait of former Playboy model Holly Madison as a mermaid. “It hasn’t become mainstream,” says the Silverton’s aquarium manager, Thomas Harder, of his mermaid shows, “but we’re not on the fringe anymore.”Naturally, not every mermaid is a joiner. MeduSirena, a tall, wild-haired redhead who runs the weekly fire-eating mermaid show at the Wreck Bar at the Sheraton in Fort Lauderdale considers herself above the general mermaid riffraff. “I call it aquatic performance. I don’t call it a mermaid. I don’t go around saying, ‘I’m a mermaid,’” she says, doing a pejorative impression of the type of person who would say, “I’m a mermaid.” As it nears midnight at Mer-Con, the forces buoying the mermaid craze become clearer. Stars such as Hannah Mermaid and MeduSirena hang in the shallow end of a pool with the old guy dressed like Neptune, and the place starts to resemble an episode of HBO’s Real Sex. “There’s definitely something weird with mermaids and sex, just like with vampires,” says Turgeon, the novelist tapped to run Mermaids magazine. “They’re incredibly seductive, and they could kill you. You have all the angsty stuff that you have with vampires. Except you have all this female power.”Garrett Grioua, who does security at a club in Fort Lauderdale, felt the same way when his belly-dancing fiancée decided to train to become a professional mermaid at the Wreck Bar. “It’s an exotic thing, seeing beautiful women dance underwater,” he says. “I’m not going to lie. It’s hot.”'),\n",

       "  '2011-08-25',\n",
       "  'In May, Angela Ahrendts, the chief executive officer of Burberry, met with Salesforce.com CEO Marc Benioff in Northern California’s Half Moon Bay. During their meeting, Benioff grabbed a hotel notepad and sketched out ideas for how Salesforce could help Burberry harness the excitement around social media sites to boost sales and customer loyalty. Then he took out his iPad, snapped a photo of his handiwork, and, using Salesforce’s own social networking technology, called Chatter, sent it to a group of his executives. Within 10 minutes they were responding with their own ideas. Ahrendts was impressed. “We want to get [Burberry] globally connected after 155 years,” she says.Many big businesses have been slow to experiment with social media, a freewheeling realm where they can’t easily control the conversation. At Salesforce’s annual Dreamforce conference in San Francisco on Aug. 31, Benioff will explain why his customers should go social—and let Salesforce help them. The pitch, in short, is that while consumers are online shopping, trading product tips, and discussing their vacations on Facebook, Twitter, or elsewhere, Salesforce software can help companies understand and profit from those desires and complaints. Bank of America, for instance, is already using Salesforce software to respond to customers on Twitter. “Businesses need to become social enterprises,” says Benioff. “This is more than just websites. Here’s how to make your customers your friends.”Salesforce’s main business—selling Web-based programs to track sales leads, project revenue, and help call-center reps deal with problems—is still growing at 35 percent annually, and the company is on track for at least $2.2 billion in sales this year. But Benioff says customers have been asking for better ways to respond to the explosive growth of social media. Benioff plans to use the conference to introduce a newer, higher-priced option for its “Winter ’12” software, which will let sales managers monitor what’s being said about their company and its products on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. A new version of Chatter, Salesforce’s technology for creating secure social networks, will loop customers into Facebook-style discussions and let them share documents and slides. Toyota Motor is using it to create a social network that connects dealers with drivers, helping them to track maintenance and repairs, among other things. Companies including PepsiCo’s Gatorade, Walt Disney, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, and L’Oréal have also signed up for some of Salesforce’s new social media offerings.Benioff says the social media push will help Salesforce nearly quintuple annual sales, to $10 billion, though he sets no date for that goal. Wall Street is optimistic. Today the stock is trading at 821 times last year’s earnings, 6.6 times the tech industry average, according to Bloomberg data. This despite the fact that Salesforce earned just $43.1 million in the second quarter—and actually suffered a small loss if options and other expenses are included. Next quarter, analysts expect the company to lose $6.5 million, in part because of hiring and acquisition expenses. In May, Salesforce paid $340 million for Radian6, which makes software to monitor social media conversations (and is now a part of the Winter ’12 offering). Meanwhile, early social media initiatives aren’t exactly raking in big bucks. Salesforce had to cut the price of the first iteration of Chatter from $50 to $15 per user per month, says Benioff. “The bear story is they’re spending money somewhat like drunken sailors,” says Brent Thill, an analyst at UBS who nonetheless rates Salesforce a “buy,” in part because of the social media efforts.As Salesforce’s customers experiment with social media tools, they’ll need to hire programmers to customize the company’s offerings. Salesforce’s first attempt at creating developer-friendly tools, a programming language called Apex, didn’t find many fans, especially among professional Web developers. “None of those developers wanted anything to do with the platform,” says Scott Raney, a partner at Redpoint Ventures. His firm invested in Heroku, a maker of software tools, which Salesforce bought last year for $212 million.The Heroku acquisition is part of a broader strategy to do more to attract outside developers. At Dreamforce, Benioff will announce a broad array of new tools geared to the modern programmer. Salesforce has also rewritten its mobile technology using a new Web standard, HTML5, so developers for any platform—whether it’s Apple’s iOS or Google’s Android—can easily design applications that work with it. Medical device maker Zimmer Holdings used Salesforce tools to build an iPad app for its 1,200 salespeople. “Everything you’re doing in that app is Salesforce except the look and feel,” says Don Lamping, associate surgeon communications director.Benioff’s bet is that companies that embrace social media and mobile computing will get closer to their customers—and those that don’t will get left behind. “It’s a true bifurcation,” he says. “For consumers it’s a whirlwind. For enterprises it’s a challenge and an opportunity.”The bottom line: CEO Benioff hopes to quintuple revenue, to $10 billion, in part by embracing social media. Early efforts have had mixed results.'),\n",

       " ('Will the Scandal Tame Murdoch?',\n",
       "  '2011-07-21',\n",
       "  'When Rupert Murdoch faced inquisitors from a British Parliamentary committee on July 19, the public Murdoch was on display: monosyllabic, defiant, and unwilling to accept full responsibility for the corruption that has ensnarled his media empire. “A lot of people had different agendas in trying to build this hysteria,” Murdoch said when asked who he blamed for the sizeable business setbacks of News Corp. in the U.K., due to the phone hacking scandal. “All our competitors in this country formally announced a consortium to try and stop us. They caught us with dirty hands and built hysteria around it.”It was a characteristic performance from a mogul who’s perfected the art of the grand escape during a career in which he has stared down competitors, outmaneuvered rivals, and solidified his command over a media empire built from a single family-owned newspaper.The question now is whether Murdoch will be able to continue to run his company exactly as he pleases. Government investigators in London and Washington are looking at possible misdeeds involving phone hacking. Shareholders have shaved more than $5 billion off the company’s market value. Even its directors, largely silent in recent weeks except for a few murmurs of support for Murdoch, seem to have taken notice. They’ve hired Michael B. Mukasey, a former U.S. Attorney General, and Mary Jo White, a former U.S. Attorney in New York, to advise them on governance issues.What they are likely to find is that Murdoch’s shareholders haven’t always prospered under his iron-fisted control. News Corp.’s stock performance has trailed that of its largest rivals, including Walt Disney, Viacom, and Time Warner, over the last five years. (Bloomberg Businessweek’s owner, Bloomberg LP, is a competitor of News Corp.) “There’s just sort of this generic Murdoch discount, which encompasses the concern that he will make decisions that are not consistent with other shareholder interests,” says Michael Morris, an analyst at Davenport & Co. in Richmond, Va. Mario J. Gabelli, chairman of Gamco Investors, which owns 6.7 million shares of News Corp. nonvoting stock, acknowledges that some investors don’t trust Murdoch. “There has always been the perception that he would go off and buy something—that he might change direction,” Gabelli says. “This is a great collection of assets, however,” he adds.Those assets, some shareholders complain, have for decades been operated at the whim of Murdoch, who along with a family trust owns 39.7 percent of the company’s voting stock. When family control was threatened in 2004 by cable billionaire John C. Malone, who had assembled 16 percent of News Corp.’s shares, Murdoch swapped News Corp.’s stake in the fast-growing satellite company DirecTV to recapture the stock. Critics call the deal embarrassingly one-sided. To get Malone’s $11.3 billion stake, Murdoch anted up $12.3 billion in News Corp. assets, including $465 million in cash, three regional sports cable channels in the U.S., and a 41 percent stake in DirecTV. Three years after the deal closed, the value of DirecTV had doubled, while News Corp.’s had fallen by 5 percent—even before the hacking scandal. “This is a company where no one could say no to Rupert Murdoch,” says Murdoch biographer Michael Wolff, author of The Man Who Owns the News. “And it has only gotten more so as he has gotten older and more focused on the line of succession.”The company’s executive ranks have thinned further since 2007, when Murdoch named his 38-year-old son, James, chairman of News International, which operates the parent’s British newspapers. News Corp. President Peter Chernin, a 20-year employee, left in 2009 as Murdoch increasingly turned to his son for counsel. Chernin now produces TV shows and movies under a production deal with the company.Chernin was followed out the door by media strategist Gary Ginsberg, a former aide to Bill Clinton, who had helped soften Murdoch’s image in the press and on Capitol Hill after joining the company in 1999. Ginsberg was pressured to leave by James Murdoch, according to Wolff. More recently, General Counsel Lawrence “Lon” Jacobs left in June to “pursue new opportunities,” the company said. “These are the exact kinds of people Murdoch would need in the kind of situation he finds himself right now,” says Wolff. “They were the kinds of people he needed to keep him in check.”Left to his own devices, Murdoch can pursue pet projects without being challenged. In 2007 he spent months wooing the Bancroft family to persuade them to sell their controlling interest in Dow Jones, publisher of the Wall Street Journal—against the advice of Chernin and others. Intent on taking on the New York Times, Murdoch finally sealed the deal with a rich $5.6 billion purchase price. Four months later, News Corp. wrote down its value by $2.8 billion.Murdoch also hasn’t been shy about mixing the interests of his publicly held company and those of his family. He gave both his sons, James and the older Lachlan, positions of authority at early ages. The husband of daughter Elisabeth has done public-relations work for News Corp. And his wife, Wendi Deng, has served in the past as a strategic advisor on Myspace’s business interests in China.Murdoch’s all-in-the-family dealings reached a new level in February, when News Corp. said it would pay $673 million to buy Shine Group, a London-based production company owned by his daughter Elisabeth, that produced NBC’s The Office, The Biggest Loser, and other shows. “Murdoch did not even pretend there was a valid strategic purpose for News Corp. to buy Shine,” Amalgamated Bank and pension funds said in a lawsuit brought on Mar. 16 in Delaware state court. “The transaction is a naked and selfish endeavor by Murdoch to further infuse the upper ranks of News Corp. with his offspring.” News Corp. President Chase Carey told investors in March that the Shine deal was valid because of the company’s string of hits and that Elisabeth’s family connection “had nothing to do with it.”The shareholder suit alleges that Murdoch overpaid for Shine, calculating that News Corp. paid 13.1 times Shine’s $45.6 million in Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, a metric of cash-earning capacity) for 2009. That compares with the $510 million purchase in June by Apollo Global Management of American Idol owner CKx, a deal valued at 8.5 times CKx’s $60.23 million in Ebitda. “The problem is that this is a company that has no real independent board to provide oversight,” says Charles Elson, director of the University of Delaware’s John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance. “When Rupert Murdoch controls the votes of this company, he can elect a new board anytime he wants, so who is going to disagree with him?”The Delaware lawsuit claims that few of News Corp.’s independent directors are truly independent, including Roderick Eddington, chairman of the audit committee and the company’s lead independent director. Eddington is also nonexecutive chairman of JPMorgan Australia Group, a unit of the investment company that advised Elisabeth Murdoch on the Shine transaction. He did not respond to e-mails. In a statement last week, director Tom Perkins said “the board honestly thinks Rupert is a genius.” News Corp. has denied the allegations, and the directors have moved to dismiss the case.Company finances are affected when problems arise. In 2002, for example, Canal+, the pay TV company owned by Vivendi, filed a suit in California, alleging that its competitor NDS, at the time a 79 percent-owned subsidiary of News Corp., had deliberately hacked the company’s encryption system and then leaked the code onto the Internet. NDS denied wrongdoing and moved to have the suit dismissed. In April 2002, however, a former NDS contractor gave a deposition in the case, testifying to firsthand knowledge of the hacking. Six months later, News Corp. agreed to the $985 million purchase of an Italian pay-TV operator, Telepiu, from Canal+’s parent company Vivendi. Shortly after, Canal+ dropped its suit. Vivendi didn’t comment by press time. News Corp. had no comment.Allegations of News Corp. misbehavior on the elder Murdoch’s watch haven’t just come from rivals. In 2007 publisher Judith Regan sued her former employers at News Corp., alleging to be the victim of a “deliberate smear campaign” after her departure. The company eventually settled the suit for $10.75 million. That was a relative bargain compared with the $500 million News Corp. agreed in February to pay to Valassis Communications to settle lawsuits alleging that employees at News Corp.’s supermarket coupon unit had made threats against competitors and hacked into rivals’ computers.All this, plus the hacking furor, has raised questions about whether Murdoch will need outside help to better-manage his embattled company. At Tuesday’s Parliamentary hearing, Conservative Party member Damian Collins asked whether “you think you have a cultural problem within your organization that people only tell you things that they think you want to hear?” Murdoch maintained that his trusted advisers don’t hold back. “I’m sure there may be people who try to please me. That would be human nature. It’s up to me to see through that.”The bottom line: Shareholders, who have lost more than $5 billion in market value in about two weeks, hope the scandal brings tightened oversight.'),\n",

       "  'Andy Wexler didn’t much enjoy his own childhood camp experience. The only part he liked was going on field trips. That’s why, as a 19-year-old junior at the University of California at Los Angeles in 1990, he borrowed $1,000 to start his own camp based entirely on daily excursions to Disney Land, Magic Mountain, karate studios, and more. “I thought it would be a fun thing to do, so I got a list of kids and called them up,” says Wexler. “I probably did about 1,000 telephone calls and convinced 25 parents to send me their kids.”Within five years, his Southern California-based enterprise grew to more than 500 campers, and had revenues of more than $1 million for an 11-week season. Today, Wexler’s idea has evolved into Pali Overnight Adventures, a 74-acre camp complex offering 9-to-16-year-old attendees 16 areas of concentration ranging from Secret Agent sessions, where kids do things like soar down ziplines while firing paintball guns, to Hollywood Stunt Camp, where campers learn to jump from a two-story building, to a Culinary Institute where they receive instruction from professional chefs. Wexler’s camps cost almost $1,700 per week, as compared to, say, Camp Marston, a 90-year-old YMCA camp near San Diego, which costs $535 for six days. Pali’s revenue has averaged 10 percent growth annually over the past decade and rose 39 percent this year: “If we have a day where we make under $25,000, we’re in trouble,” he says.Pali is one of a growing number of specialty camps that aren’t content with traditional pastimes like roasting marshmallows around the fire. North Carolina-based Broadreach runs travel camps for teens in over 35 countries, providing instruction in underwater photography, Hatha yoga, marine biology, and Caribbean cultural immersion, among other disciplines. At Cross Trail Outfitters, a Texas-based organization for Christian boys, 17- to 20-year-old campers pay $750 a week to “pursue giant alligators, bowfish for enormous gator gars, and hunt for wild boars (with pit bulls and bowie knives) and exotic Nilgai antelope,” according to CTO literature.Tampa Liberty School, hosted by Tea Party affiliate group The 912 Project, teaches 8-to-12-year-olds “the principles of liberty, free markets, and limited government.” Jeff Lukens, 53, whose day job is at an auto auction firm, will run this year’s session. The first lesson will teach campers the difference between European tyranny and freedom in America: After walking into a room that’s “kind of dark and gray and austere … [and being made] to sit down, be quiet, and do what they’re told … we tell them, there’s this other place you can go to called the New World,” says Lukens. Once they’ve crossed an obstacle course representing the Atlantic, the campers arrive in America. “It’s colorful, it’s bright, it’s cheery—they get over there and we pop confetti in the air and it’s a party,” says Lukens. The kids later clean up the mess, so they know that “with freedom comes responsibility.” Other lessons teach campers about the gold standard and that “our rights come from God, not from government,” he says.International youth increasingly want in on American camps. Pali last year drew kids from 17 nations, and Wexler says he’s started sending recruiters to China and France. “I think a lot of the Chinese and French really want to live the American lifestyle,” he says. He’s betting that Pali’s specialized camps with curricula such as Motorsports Extravaganza or Broadcast Journalism will let them do just that.Still, summer camp historian Leslie Paris, a professor at the University of British Columbia, says that most people want an old-fashioned outdoorsy experience away from the distractions of modern life. Newfangled visions of camp, Paris says, will “never become the dominant model because they don’t represent what much of the client base of camping believes to be real camp.”The bottom line: There are 2,400 accredited camps in the U.S. Increasingly, they’re offering specialized—and expensive—activities.'),\n",

       "  'Ever since his days at the University of California at San Diego in the late 1990s, Nicholas Woodman wanted a way for him and his surfing buddies to capture their exploits without having to take turns sitting on shore with a camera and telephoto lens. “No surfer wants to be the photographer, especially when the waves are good,” he says.Woodman, 36, eventually decided to solve the problem and founded GoPro in 2002. GoPro makes a small, durable, lightweight (just 3.3 ounces) camcorder and special mounts to attach the device to surfboards, helmets, ski poles, car hoods, or pretty much anything else. It’s become a phenomenon in the world of extreme sports, with back-country snowboarders, kayakers, scuba divers, and others using it to document their feats. Woodman’s company has sold hundreds of thousands of them through sports shops and is only now reaching beyond its X Game base with national TV ads and a distribution deal with Best Buy. “It’s a very cool story,” says Christopher Chute, an analyst with IDC. “GoPro may well be the world’s fastest-growing camera company.”The stepson of Irwin Federman, a chip industry pioneer and successful venture capitalist, Woodman started an Internet marketing firm after college, but it didn’t survive the dot-com bust. He decompressed with a five-month surfing trip to Indonesia and Australia, where he began testing prototypes of a wrist-mounted camera. Once he got the design right, he borrowed and raised $30,000—in part by selling Indonesian bead-and-shell necklaces from the back of hisVolkswagen bus—and hired some buddies to cold-call surf shops and ask them to stock GoPro’s Hero line of cameras.Corporate giants such as Samsung have worked on wearable camcorders for years, but GoPro’s devices, which cost $180 to $300, stand out for image and sound quality, ease of use, and ruggedness. They’re waterproof to 180 feet and drop-proof from 3,000 feet. (One was dropped from that height by a skydiver, who still uses it.) A skier can attach one to his helmet to record what he sees and another to the tip of his ski to film himself. The cameras are also becoming a staple on TV, where they have been used to help film dozens of reality shows, including Deadliest Catch and Whale Wars. George Lucas is using them to shoot part of his next film, Red Tails.Woodman, who says GoPro is profitable enough to go public, wants to expand beyond hardware into media. One idea is for a cable show featuring extreme sports videos shot by GoPro users. The push into content is one reason Steamboat Ventures, the venture capital arm of Walt Disney, recently invested in GoPro. Says Beau Laskey, managing director of the fund: “There’s the potential for this to be much more than a camera company.”Woodman’s Internet marketing company went bust in 2001Began testing camcorder designs on a five-month surf tripReality TV shows and other media'),\n",

       "  'What\\'s a Hollywood producer to do after selling the rights to the DVDs, TV show, action figures, and apparel tied to a summer blockbuster? It\\'s 2011, and that means: branded virtual goods.Social games played on Facebook are the new frontier for film and television tie-ins. This summer, two movies—Disney\\'s (DIS) Cars 2 and Fox\\'s (NWS) Mr. Popper\\'s Penguins—and a popular Showtime (CBS) series will attempt to build buzz and some extra revenue by featuring their characters in Facebook games.For help, studios are turning to developers with experience in social games, an overnight industry that\\'s amassed an audience of more than 300 million people who will spend $4.9 billion this year on virtual goods—tractors on Zynga\\'s FarmVille, and so forth—estimates research firm ThinkEquity. \"We\\'ve been asked by every major media property in the world to do something in the last 12 months,\" says Peter Relan, executive chairman of CrowdStar, a game maker in Burlingame, Calif.The most startling example of this incipient industry: Weeds Social Club, a game launching this month in conjunction with the June 27 season premiere of Showtime\\'s hit show Weeds. Users buy and plant different strains of marijuana—from downmarket \"Schwag Weed\" to the pricier and more (virtually) potent \"Jamaican Ganja\"—and then harvest the crop before it withers. Players then set prices above or below street value, determine how much customer risk they\\'re willing to take, and wait for a hooded-sweatshirt-wearing dealer—really—to swing by and pick up the goods. Along the way, users barter with friends, outfit their pad with flat-screen TVs, bongs, and other digital accessories, and spend real money on \"favors\"—game points that let them buy nicer goods. Players get pot-growing tips from Andy Botwin, a character voiced by actor Justin Kirk from the show, and perform tasks that correlate with the storyline from the latest TV episode. Eventually the game may be used to test out new characters or plot twists, says Curt Marvis, president of digital media at Lionsgate (LGF), the show\\'s producer and distributor. \"In the social realm, it\\'s a living, breathing experience,\" he says, \"one where you get a fan base of engaged users.\" The game has been approved by Facebook, and its creators say it does not break any laws.Celebrities, brand names, and mature themes may lure older audiences to social games, which have tended to skew young. \"There has been this philosophy of don\\'t offend anyone, be very broad—this Hallmark card philosophy,\" says Marc Ecko, the urban-fashion icon. Ecko Code, his company\\'s new social-game unit, developed Weeds Social Club and also plans to launch games based around Showtime shows Dexter and The Borgias, as well as one based on the life of Bob Marley. Ecko expects to make at least $1 million per month selling virtual goods within each app, and will share those revenues with the media companies who own rights to these brands. Says Ecko: \"We believe there is a user out there that wants something with more teeth and more counter culture.\"The bottom line: Hollywood studios\\' latest promotional vehicle: social games. Mature themes may broaden the apps\\' appeal.'),\n",

       "  '2011-06-16',\n",
       "  'Those Guys Have All the Fun: Inside the World of ESPN\\nBy James Andrew Miller and Tom Shales\\nLittle, Brown; 784pp; $27.99\\n In 1980, as he entered the embittered-crank years of his dotage, Howard Cosell lamented that ours had become a \"sick, sports-obsessed country.\" The founders of ESPN, then a wobbly year-old enterprise, must have heard this comment and thought, \"From your mouth to God\\'s ears, buddy.\" For in those days, the concept of a 24-hour sports channel, far from making perfect sense, seemed radical: an idea that could only have been dreamed up by ... well, a sick, sports-obsessed mind.That mind belonged to Bill Rasmussen, a hustler who had been living on the fringes of sports-world respectability. In 1978 he was fired from his job as a PR man for the New England Whalers, a World Hockey Assn. team located in the small-market town of Hartford, Conn. Picking up the pieces of his career, Bill, along with a son in his early twenties, Scott, decided to go entrepreneurial: What if they started a cable channel devoted entirely to Connecticut sports?As we learn in James Andrew Miller and Tom Shales\\'s rollicking oral history of ESPN, Those Guys Have All the Fun, it was only upon meeting with a representative from RCA\\'s satellite division that the Rasmussens realized they would be able to beam their signal across the whole U.S. of A., making national sports programming a viable option. \"Bill and Scott were looking at each other,\" recalls that RCA rep, Al Parinello, in the book, \"and they might have been getting sexually excited, I\\'m not sure. But I can tell that they were very, very excited.\"This naughty, weren\\'t-we-wacky tone, redolent of tales retold over beers at the 30th reunion of a particularly self-satisfied band of fraternity brothers, runs rampant in Those Guys Have All the Fun. There is also considerable deployment of the words \"balls\" and \"ballsy,\" usually by men describing their own actions.Modesty is not a prevailing trait among Miller and Shales\\'s 500-plus interviewees. Nevertheless, Those Guys is, for much of its ample length, an engaging read—its intrigue often enhanced by the very egotism of its principals. That old adage about success having a thousand fathers? So true. Bill Rasmussen may have provided the initial spark, but he was quickly shunted aside into a figurehead role, and page after page is consumed by the testimony of various executives, old sports-TV hands, and on-air personalities claiming that they were the ones that led the Entertainment and Sports Programming Network from its scrappy origins to its current status as the Worldwide Leader in Sports.While there\\'s plenty of juicy stuff throughout for readers looking for gossip about their favorite SportsCenter anchors (even the kind, imperturbable charter anchor Bob Ley uses a cuss word in discussing the loathed Keith Olbermann\\'s departure from the network, saying it triggered \"unrestrained [bleeping] joy\"), the narrative is most appealing in the early going, which crackles with the excitement of an empire being built and a sensibility being born. Miller and Shales cross-cut deftly among their inter- viewees to convey something close to the real-time exhilaration these people felt when ESPN secured the broadcast rights to early rounds of the NCAA basketball tournament, or turned the America\\'s Cup yacht race into compelling TV, or did the deals—then unheard of in the business—to make cable operators pay on a per-subscriber basis to carry the network.It\\'s also fun to time-travel back into the quaint days when start-ups were the domain not of slick venture capitalists and insouciant Harvard kids in hoodies but of middle-aged desperados and old-line, blue-chip moneymen. ESPN was kept afloat in its formative years by Getty Oil, and among the book\\'s greatest behind-the-scenes characters is Stuart Evey, the Getty executive who served as the liaison between the network\\'s petro-overlords and its day-to-day managers. A vestige even then of the Mad Men era (\"He was the kind of manager that could only survive in a fairly unprofessional corporate environment,\" one colleague observes), Evey was a swingin\\', high-functioning alcoholic—miraculously still alive and now sober—who exasperated his charges with his meddling, boozing, and tomcatting. To his credit, though, he kept the Getty cash flowing in.The most fascinating character in the book, though, is the sleepy central Connecticut town of Bristol, where, by dint of the original Rasmussen connection, ESPN put down roots. On one hand, Bristol\\'s Nowheresville status was a boon, allowing the network to develop in a vacuum, away from the judgments of the media know-it-alls of New York. On the other hand, Bristol\\'s isolation was a detriment to the social lives of the network\\'s employees, its younger ones especially. Several figures vent their grievances on this front; the longtime SportsCenter stalwart Gary Miller flat-out disses the town as a \"wasteland,\" while the former network chairman, Steve Bornstein (now head of the NFL Network), partly attributes ESPN\\'s recurring sexual harassment issues to the \"frat house\" atmosphere that the company\\'s isolation engendered.Today, professional athletes consider it a mark of arrival to be invited to the Bristol campus to star in one of those goofball-vérité \"This is SportsCenter\" ads, and ESPN hums on indomitably, a jewel of the Walt Disney (DIS) empire, with multiple channels, a magazine, a radio network, the NFL\\'s Monday Night Football package, and the best Web presence in sports. Yet the book bogs down as ESPN\\'s success snowballs. Those Guys Have All the Fun has the same problem as another epic tome of our time, Keith Richards\\'s Life. Once the dizzying climb to the top is achieved, a degree of insignificant-anecdote fatigue sets in. Just as no one really cares about Keef\\'s latter-day memories of filming Pirates of the Caribbean, no one, but no one, really needs to know the insider details of the bidding war between CBS and ESPN for the services of sideline reporter Bonnie Bernstein.This injudicious lack of pruning aside, there are still plenty of mini-plots worth cherry-picking from the book\\'s second half. There\\'s new light shed, for example, on the messy 2003 experiment of adding Rush Limbaugh to the Sunday NFL Countdown team. And the authors don\\'t shy away from addressing the lingering issue of institutional misogyny and malfeasance, or at least the perception of it as perpetuated by blogs like Deadspin and by the sex scandals involving baseball analyst Steve Phillips and football commentator Sean Salisbury.In their previous mega-thick oral history, Live from New York, Miller and Shales included a quote from Tina Fey about how settled an institution Saturday Night Live has become in its middle age. \"The Seventies and the 21st century are just so different,\" Fey says. \"There\\'s no drugs and there\\'s no sex at the show now. I would have been terrified if I was back here in the old days.\" The later pages of Those Guys Have All the Fun offer no such picture of chastity, unity, contentment, or reconciliation. The frat-boy antics continue, the ego clashes persist, and there are tiffs going on that we innocent sports fans have no idea about (Chris Berman vs. Tony Kornheiser? Bill Simmons vs. Mike Tirico?).ESPN, even in its dominance, remains a volatile place: the product not of one visionary but rather an alchemical mix of luck, timing, shoe leather, talent, and the insatiable appetite of this sick, sports-obsessed country.'),\n",

       "  '(Corrects title for Eric Varvel in the third paragraph.)Before setting out in orderly pairs to spread their gospel door-to-door, nearly all U.S. Mormon missionaries pass through the Provo Missionary Training Center. Inside the sprawling brown-brick complex, thousands of 19- and 20-year-old men in oversized black suits work alongside women in below-the-knee skirts and brightly colored tops. All of them wear name tags.For one to three months (depending on the language challenge ahead), their days begin at 6:30 a.m. and end at 10:30 p.m., and include 10 hours of class and study time. On their one day off per week, missionaries-to-be do laundry, write home, and stock up on supplies at the training center store where pre-knotted ties ($15-$20) and key-chain rings with screw-top vials for carrying consecrated oils ($3.50) hang beside highlighters, alarm clocks, and hymnbooks translated into roughly 50 foreign languages. The grounds are under tight security, and no one leaves without permission. This is the last stop for roughly 20,000 young Mormons each year before they\\'re driven 45 miles north to Salt Lake City International Airport and whisked off to one of more than 150 countries to make converts.The Provo Missionary Training Center (MTC) and its curriculum are designed to render all trainees equal servants of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (LDS), yet many of the men who prepared for their missions here, or at the center\\'s earlier incarnations, have gone on to become among the most distinguished and recognizable faces in American business and civic life. There\\'s Mitt Romney (mission: France), who as of 2007 had amassed an estimated $190 million to $250 million as head of Bain Capital, rescued the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Olympics from a corruption scandal, spent four years as the governor of Massachusetts, and announced his second run for President on June 2. His potential rival for the Republican nomination is Jon Huntsman Jr. (Taiwan), a former Utah governor who negotiated dozens of free-trade agreements as a U.S. trade representative and served as ambassador to China from 2009-2011. The list also includes JetBlue (JBLU) founder David Neeleman (Brazil), Chief Executive Officer of the global Investment Bank of Credit Suisse Eric Varvel (who confirmed training at the Provo MTC but would provide no more information), self-help mogul Stephen Covey (England), author of The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, Kim Clark (Germany), former dean of Harvard Business School, and Gary Crittenden (Germany), who\\'s served as CFO for Citigroup (C), American Express (AXP), and Sears Roebuck.Gary Cornia, dean of Mormon-run Brigham Young University\\'s Marriott School of Management, is often asked what makes Mormons so successful. \"I\\'m not going to say we beat everybody out, but we do have a reputation,\" says Cornia. \"And one of the defining opportunities for young men and young women is the mission experience.\" Reflecting on his own mission to the mid-Atlantic states, Cornia adds, \"When I left, the son of a relatively poor mother and a father who died when I was young, I frankly didn\\'t know if I could do anything. I came back with the confidence that I can accomplish most hard things. I may not have had that otherwise.\"The Mormon Church is 181 years old, and its adherents compose less than 2 percent of the U.S. population, according to a 2009 American Religious Identification Survey (ARIS). Yet Latter-Day Saints hold, or have held, a seemingly disproportionate number of top jobs at such major corporations as Marriott International (MAR), American Express, American Motors, Dell Computers (DELL), Lufthansa, Fisher-Price (MAT), Life Re, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, Madison Square Garden, La Quinta Properties, PricewaterhouseCooper, and Stanley Black & Decker (SWK). The head of human resources at Citigroup is Mormon, and in 2010 Goldman Sachs (GS) hired 31 grads from BYU, the same number it hired from the University of Pennsylvania\\'s Wharton School.There\\'s a risk of stereotyping in drawing conclusions about any religion based on a sampling of its exceptional adherents, but church leaders and Mormon businessmen embrace the idea that there\\'s a relationship between the missionary experience and success in business. \"The mission is like a crucible experience [and] a lot of people come out with the capacity to lead,\" says Clark, who left HBS in 2005 to preside over BYU-Idaho at the request of the LDS Church\\'s then president, Gordon Hinckley, regarded by Mormons as a living prophet; as Clark tells people, \"It was like getting a phone call from Moses.\"Almost all of the Mormon businessmen contacted for this story—the teachings of the church encourage women to stay home—see a connection between their faith and their work. (Romney and Huntsman did not respond to interview requests.)So far the church has sent over 1 million missionaries into the world. All young Mormon men, referred to as \"elders,\" are asked to serve a mission if they are in good standing. Young women, called \"sisters,\" serve voluntarily and make up about 20 percent of the missionary force. Roughly 50 percent of U.S. Mormon missionaries go abroad to countries as disparate as Albania, Ghana, Micronesia, and France, with each individual\\'s placement a matter of \"divine inspiration,\" according to the Provo MTC\\'s director, Richard I. Heaton. Young Mormons submit their medical records and basic CVs to the \"Twelve Apostles,\" who in stature rank just below the church\\'s president. The group then prays to find out where each individual is needed.Once on site, missionaries pay a $400 share of their room and board and are required to live as the locals do. \"The wonderful thing is that you don\\'t experience Korea from the 25th floor of the Hyatt,\" says Harvard Business School professor Clayton Christensen, a Rhodes scholar and board member at India\\'s Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), who did his mission in Korea from 1971 to 1973. \"They don\\'t have air conditioning, you don\\'t have air conditioning; they don\\'t have plumbing, you don\\'t have plumbing.\"Each elder or sister spends every moment of every day in tandem with another, sleeping and rising at the same time in a shared room. That companion isn\\'t always American and doesn\\'t necessarily speak English. For the next two years, these \"companionships\" proselytize for 10 hours a day, six days a week, knocking on doors and offering The Book of Mormon to strangers, often in languages the missionaries barely know how to speak. They must persuade people to listen and learn to persevere in the face of near-constant rejection. \"I don\\'t think there\\'s any more demanding profession than being a Mormon missionary,\" says Christensen.Over the course of a mission, each individual rotates through two or three companions, an experience that forces the development of interpersonal skills, according to Joseph Ogden, assistant dean at BYU\\'s Marriott School. One person is always assigned a senior role, usually on the strength of time served. Sometimes seniority is assigned by church officials\\' assessment of leadership abilities. Ogden remembers being given senior status over a 26-year-old ex-Green Beret while on his mission to Australia. \"I was this lanky teenager ... and you could tell he really wanted to be in charge,\" says Ogden. \"That was a tough one.\"Missionaries aren\\'t allowed access to news and are only permitted two phone calls home each year, on Mother\\'s Day and Christmas. Guidelines are laid out in a pocket-sized handbook that Provo MTC President Gordon D. Brown says helps them to focus, stay safe, and integrate faster. The book has instructions on a wide range of activities: Full-court basketball games, for example, are banned, while half-court is permissible. Returned missionaries say that simply abiding by all the rules is enough to impart a sense of accomplishment.Serving abroad helps Mormons learn languages (around 70 percent of BYU students are bilingual). It also seems to provide them with insight into foreign cultures and economies, an asset many missionaries have used to start businesses and careers. Neeleman served in Brazil and, after founding JetBlue Airways, went on to start Azul Airlines, a domestic Brazilian carrier. L. Todd Budge, chairman of Tokyo Star Bank, used his mission experience in Japan to become the first non-Japanese CEO of a Japanese bank and says he may never have gone abroad at all if the church had not sent him. Allan O\\'Bryant, now Japan CEO at Reinsurance Group of America, served in Japan and later became the president of AFLAC International.Mitt Romney served in France from 1966 to 1968, after his freshman year at Stanford University. Widespread anti-American sentiment at the time made proselytizing especially difficult; in a 2007 New York Times article, Romney described his mission as humbling, saying it was the only time in his life \"when most of what I was trying to do was rejected.\"As the son of George Romney, the ex-American Motors CEO who was then governor of Michigan, Mitt Romney enjoyed privileges unheard of for most elders and entered the mission field of Bordeaux and Paris having completed three years of French at Michigan\\'s elite Cranbrook School. Once on site, Romney broke handbook rules to sneak out to the movies and eat coq au vin, and used his father\\'s connections to arrange a meal at the American Embassy, according to the Times. Still, Romney has credited the experience with deepening his faith and ambition. Eager to move up through the missionary ranks, he experimented with innovative means of getting out the Mormon Word, like hosting \"American night\" at a local café and staging an exhibition baseball game. According to The Washington Post, he also pitched articles about Mormons to newspapers and even tried proselytizing at bars.Romney\\'s mission was marred by tragedy. On June 16, 1968, he was asked to chauffeur the couple presiding over the region\\'s missionaries and was at the wheel during a head-on collision that killed the mission president\\'s wife. Romney was left unconscious and so badly mangled that a police officer mistakenly pronounced him dead. He was rushed to the hospital and found to have a concussion, fractured ribs, and a broken arm.When the mission president returned to the U.S. to bury his wife, Romney was asked to take charge of the region\\'s missionaries, who numbered around 200. He thrived in the position, traveling across France to lead conferences. Under his leadership, France\\'s missionaries exceeded 200 baptisms for the first time in a decade.Dave Checketts is chairman of the sports, entertainment, and media enterprise SCP Worldwide, the owner of the St. Louis Blues, and a Mormon whose past titles have included CEO of Madison Square Garden. Checketts served his mission in East Los Angeles, mostly walking the streets of neighborhoods such as Compton, Whittier, and Boyle Heights. The hardest part, he says, was splitting from his comparatively comfortable teenage life. \"You leave your family, your friends, your car, you don\\'t date for two years, and you\\'re 19 years old,\" he says. \"I missed my freedom, I missed going out to eat—I was suddenly working hard, knocking on doors, trying to find people who would listen, dressing every day in a shirt and tie, whereas before I probably had on a T-shirt and jeans.\"In witnessing extreme poverty and wealth, Checketts says he understood that he needed to take responsibility for his future. Upon returning to college, he shot to the top of his class and later became president of the National Basketball Assn.\\'s Utah Jazz at the age of 28. \"What happens on a mission is that you grow up pretty fast,\" he says. \"You\\'re dealing with adult problems and adult issues, because when you\\'re teaching somebody the gospel of Jesus Christ, you\\'re typically meeting people who want to improve their lives ... and you kind of get a sense for how you\\'d like to live your life; you get serious about life, about school, about work.\"Kevin Rollins, the former CEO of Dell Computers and currently a senior adviser to TPG Capital, says the rejections spiked with occasional successes that he experienced during his mission in Alberta and Saskatchewan, Canada, prepared him for entrepreneurship. \"When you get into the business world, most of what you try doesn\\'t work either,\" he says. \"And so the notion of having focus and determination, working hard, and leading others along with you, those principles are all things you would look for in a corporate executive, vs. someone who closes his tent after one little disappointment.\"\\n\\n\\nMormons, who consider their faith to be a Christian denomination, take Biblical exhortations to work hard to the extreme. \"Mormonism is kind of like the Puritan ethic on high,\" says Nathan Furr, assistant professor of entrepreneurship at BYU\\'s Marriott School. \"There\\'s total emphasis on self-sufficiency, on working hard.\"This aspect of the missionary experience is rooted in the religion\\'s origins and permeates all aspects of Mormon life. Utah Governor Gary R. Herbert, a seventh-generation Mormon whose relatives were among the state\\'s original settlers, admires the Mormons who found Utah after leaving behind New York, Ohio, Illinois, and Missouri. Settlers, in his words, \"harnessed the snowpack and built reservoirs and canals and ditches, and ... literally made the desert blossom like a desert rose.\" Herbert\\'s account could be straight from The Book of Mormon\\'s version of how the land of Helam was made fruitful: \"And they pitched their tents, and began to till the ground, and began to build buildings; yea, they were industrious, and did labor exceedingly.\"Simply belonging to the highly managerial Mormon Church requires work. Mormons depend upon an unpaid \"lay\" clergy composed of ordinary congregants tapped to lead sermons each week. Congregants don\\'t just go to church on Sunday, they run the church, filling all the positions from Sunday school teacher to bishop, serving an estimated five to 25 hours each week. At the same time, they are expected to pay a 10 percent tithe on their incomes while encouraged to raise large families. Only those who tithe are given \"temple recommends,\" passes which are required to enter Mormon temples.Church obligations start early. \"Children at a very young age begin to learn things that leaders have to do—speak in public, interact with people, teach,\" says Kim Clark. Public speaking starts with two-minute presentations at the age of three, according to Kim Farah, a spokeswoman for the church. The goal is to \"help them internalize their beliefs,\" she says, and any professional benefits are secondary. Mormons don\\'t undergo grueling Battle-Hymn-of-the-Tiger-Mother upbringings, but teenagers are expected to get up early and attend seminary one hour before school, five days a week. Kids age 12 through 18 progress through hierarchical rings of youth groups, each of which has two or three appointed leaders who learn to hold meetings, take responsibility for their groups, and check on members who aren\\'t attending church regularly. One former Latter-Day Saint, a facial plastic surgeon from Brazil named Marcello Jun de Oliveira, says church commitments are so intense that \"when you finally start a job, it\\'s just like churchit\\'s so much work.\"Kevin Rollins, whose Mormon roots go back to the religion\\'s founders (and who says he worked 20 hours a week for the church while putting in another 100 hours at Dell), remembers conducting youth group meetings as a child. \"You learn by experience that it\\'s better to have an agenda, have a plan, have a structure, have people participating ... and if you have to discipline somebody, you learn to do that in private,\" he says. When Dell hired him from the consultancy Bain & Co. to head up the company\\'s Americas division—accounting for 70 percent of the company\\'s revenue at the time—Rollins had no prior experience as an executive. \"I can still remember, I was at my first meeting at Dell ... and there were, oh, I don\\'t know, 12 executives, and I think they were stunned at how I came in and ran the meeting, knowing how to run a meeting from all the times I had run one as a church member,\" he says. \"I really owe most of that natural instinct there to the training I received as a young kid.\"The church itself is a well-run global conglomerate. Ryan T. Cragun, an assistant professor at the University of Tampa and president of the Mormon Social Science Assn., says the church likely owns more acreage than there is in the state of Delaware. In Florida alone, he says, Mormons own 10 times as much land as Walt Disney (DIS), including a $1 billion for-profit cattle and citrus ranch. The LDS Church also owns commercial hunting grounds, radio stations, newspapers, real estate developers, shopping centers, and a land management company in Hawaii. Churches in the U.S. are not required to report their finances, and the Mormon Church does not, but the Financial Times in 2010 estimated the LDS Church\\'s worth at $25 billion to $30 billion.Mormons insist that self-improvement and self-reliance, not material wealth, are their religious aims, yet the Book of Mormon states, \"And thus they did prosper and become far more wealthy than those who did not belong to their church\" (Alma 1:31). The same passage goes on to explain why non-Mormons fall short: \"For those who did not belong to their church did indulge themselves in sorceries, and in idolatry or idleness, and in babblings, and in envyings and strife; wearing costly apparel; being lifted up in the pride of their own eyes.\" Armand L. Mauss, professor emeritus of Sociology and Religious Studies at Washington State University, notes that \"Mormons tend to assume that if they are doing their best in meeting their religious obligations, God will bless their worldly efforts.\"In fact, Mormons fall in the middle of the socioeconomic spectrum, their numbers perhaps skewed lower by recent converts who tend to be less educated and less wealthy, according to Furr and others. Even so, Latter-Day Saints are less likely than the general public to be in the lowest income bracket, according to the Pew Research Center.\\n\\n\\nBYU\\'s Marriott School, housed inside a bland box of tinted glass and gray pebble slabs, is a 10-minute drive from the Missionary Training Center and 2,000 miles from Wall Street. Most high-ranking business schools are located in major urban centers; BYU has Provo, a city of roughly 100,000, laid out on a grid of colossal six-lane streets built up into a maze of housing developments, hotels, and fast-food chains. Still, Dean Cornia says, \"[Wall Street finds] it interesting enough to continue to hire. If we weren\\'t producing, I don\\'t think we\\'d end up there.\"BYU\\'s undergraduate business program ranked 11th last year, just behind Georgetown University, according to Bloomberg Businessweek\\'s annual rankings. BYU ranks No. 1 for invention disclosures, new patent applications, and startup companies spun out per every $1 million of research expenditure, according to the Association of University Technology Managers.Of 127 full-time faculty members, Kristen DeTienne, a professor of organized leadership and strategy, is the sole non-LDS professor and, although she says she doesn\\'t \"buy into the religion,\" she is floored by the Mormon work ethic. \"They have this song that they sing all the time, it\\'s called Put Your Shoulder to the Wheel.\" After a shy attempt at the hymn, DeTienne corrals the school\\'s PR manager, Chad Little, to provide a more polished rendition. He obliges in a sweet tenor: \"The world has need of willing men/Who wear the worker\\'s seal/Come help the good work move along/Put your shoulder to the wheel.\"Non-Mormons who make a point of hiring Latter-Day Saints go back at least as far as Howard Hughes, who surrounded himself with Mormons, trusting them over others because of their reputation as hard-working teetotalers. Ronald Reagan also employed several LDS staffers and once declared, the \"Mormon contribution to American life is beyond measuring,\" according to historian Michael K. Winder. DeTienne says she knows several executives at top companies who express enthusiasm about hiring Mormon employees, in part because they are often faithfully married, which tends to make them \"more mature and better at managing their time, establishing priorities, working hard.\"Mormon women are partners in those faithful marriages, yet they\\'re almost absent from the business landscape. The Marriott School\\'s MBA class of 2011 is only 12 percent female, compared with HBS\\'s 36 percent, and although LDS spokeswoman Jessica Moody says Mormon women do hold leadership roles at small companies, none have reached the corporate leadership heights of Mormon men. Women are urged by the church to pursue education, but the Mormon Proclamation on the Family, which, according to religion scholar Mauss, attained near- canonical status after its issuance in 1995, says men should provide for families while women should raise children. In his 2007 book The Mormon Way of Doing Business, Mormon journalist Jeff Benedict includes a chapter titled \"The Secret to Success,\" dedicated entirely to the stay-at-home wives of famous Mormon CEOs. \"The wives\\' deep commitment to the home\" is the glue that keeps Mormon families together, says Benedict, and also \"vital to the success of these CEOs\\' performance at work.\"Kevin Rollins stresses that both man and wife must be devoted to the family, but that in \"the Mormon model, a woman would take care of the kids and the husband would assist her and go out and work and make all the money they need to survive.\" Scholar of Mormonism Melissa Proctor also notes, \"A Mormon woman who has post-graduate education is less likely to attend church,\" perhaps because \"an advanced degree does not contribute to an LDS woman\\'s status within the church,\" whereas the church tends to fill its top positions with professionally successful men.To some, the Mormon emphasis on success can seem restrictive. John Schultz, a 33-year-old warehouse manager in Toronto, opted for a \"voluntary excommunication\" in 2003 when his bishop scolded him for failing to tithe and missing Sunday services for work. His resentment toward the church had been building for some time. \"Growing up [in the Mormon Church], there was all this focus on the middle-class lifestyle, on going to college,\" he says, explaining why he felt like a misfit. \"You had to look a certain way and act a certain way.\" Schultz theorizes that the church\\'s insistence on a middle-class appearance is PR to win mainstream acceptance and recognition as a Christian faith. \"In religious and theological communities, Mormons are always pushed to the side,\" says Schultz. \"If they\\'re even considered Christian by the Christian majority, they consider that a huge gain. I think that\\'s exactly why there\\'s the pressure to put on this face.\"De Oliveira, the Brazilian surgeon, considers himself a secular Mormon. He left the church because of its role in dismantling gay marriage in California and because of what he described as class-ism in his chapel. De Oliveira, who notes that the vast majority of new converts are poor, witnessed the church\\'s influence in making some low-income families upwardly mobile, while several others spoke with him about feeling excluded by wealthier congregants who held all the top leadership positions. \"Here in Brazil, I attended a ward [parish] for half a decade where the chapel would literally, and physically, split itself down the aisle,\" he says.\\n\\n\\nAt the Salt Lake City airport, three teenage elders in white shirts and black suits are headed to Brazil on 24-month missions. Only one of them has been outside the U.S. They say they\\'re fully prepared for their undertaking and have never felt as much love as during their training period at the Provo MTC (\"with 3,000 young men dedicated to serving\"). Elder Hildebrandt, 19, says he can\\'t wait to be changed by his mission. \"It\\'s only two years,\" he says. \"People come back, and they\\'re just totally different ... they don\\'t need mom anymore.\"As for the prospect of having two Mormon Presidential candidates in 2012, the elders say they\\'re not generally interested in politics. None have heard of Jon Huntsman, and they don\\'t have much to say about Romney. Upon reflection, though, Elder Hildebrandt says, \"One good thing about having a Mormon President—we\\'ll be able to hold him to a higher standard.\"'),\n",

       "  '2011-06-09',\n",
       "  'A few years ago a friend asked me over lunch whether I knew of any \"dirt\"—his word—on a person who had recently been nominated to a post requiring Senate confirmation. The \"groups,\" he said, had decided to oppose the appointment and were trolling for information. In other words, a smear campaign was coming.This tale comes to mind in the wake of economist Peter Diamond\\'s dramatic and angry withdrawal on June 6 of his candidacy for a post on the Federal Reserve\\'s Board of Governors. Diamond, who last year was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences, was opposed by Republicans led by Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama. While Shelby claimed this was because Diamond had too little experience in monetary policy and he couldn\\'t back \"decisions made by board members who are learning on the job,\" the real aim was to turn Diamond\\'s confirmation process into a referendum on President Barack Obama\\'s economic policies.Then there\\'s the looming battle over the nomination of John Bryson to serve as Commerce Secretary. In this case, it\\'s not Bryson\\'s expertise that\\'s under fire—he ran California\\'s largest utility and is on the boards of Boeing (BA) and Walt Disney (DIS)—but his role as a co-founder of the Natural Resources Defense Council. This has stirred opposition, even among some Democrats. Senate Republicans have promised not to allow a vote on the nomination until Obama submits for congressional approval the pending free-trade agreements with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea.None of this is particularly fair to Diamond or Bryson. Still, the clamor of outrage among their supporters is, to say the least, ahistoric. What\\'s happening today is no different from what has happened to nominees over the past half century or so, when politicians and interest groups discovered that confirmation fights are excellent opportunities to fight for political advantage.We are so accustomed to vicious and distorted attacks on nominees for judicial office that we easily forget that others, too, can find themselves caught up in nasty tussles. One need only recall the treatment of Lani Guinier, President Bill Clinton\\'s initial nominee to head the Justice Dept.\\'s Civil Rights Div., whose opponents distorted her scholarship beyond recognition. Or Robert Gates, the outgoing Defense Secretary. He was nominated by President Ronald Reagan to run the CIA in 1987, but the nomination was withdrawn when Democrats protested his alleged involvement in the Iran-Contra scandal. (The accusation was that Gates had known more about the affair than he told investigators; the independent counsel wound up not pursuing the matter, and Gates finally got the CIA job in the George H.W. Bush Administration.) Speaking of the CIA, one might also recall Theodore Sorensen, who was nominated in 1977 to head the agency but had his nomination withdrawn following accusations that he was a pacifist.Although only a handful of executive branch nominations are actually defeated, the number generating controversy has risen steadily. Democrats think only Republicans get obstreperous, and Republicans think the same about Democrats. The truth is, everybody does—and with increasing frequency; Diamond was the 20th nomination to Obama\\'s executive branch to have been withdrawn.Political scientists suggest that senators use high-profile nomination battles as opportunities to communicate their own views to their constituents and to the interest groups so necessary to their election. Now that the Internet has made organizing easier and coupled elected officials more tightly to the interest groups that monitor their every word, the number of nominations that generate controversy is bound to increase.One reason the attacks on nominees are so strident is to overcome the presumption that the President is entitled to \"his own team.\" But the presumption is a myth. The Founders envisioned a heavy Senate role in appointments. Alexander Hamilton suggested in the Federalist Papers that the requirement of confirmation would, among other things, keep the President from filling the executive branch with those who were \"in some way or other personally allied to him.\" Indeed, a reason there were scarcely any squabbles over Cabinet members for the first 90 years of the republic is that Presidents consulted closely with leading senators in deciding whom to appoint.The tradition began to decline as governing grew more complex and was thrown over entirely during the Presidency of Rutherford B. Hayes. Part of the problem was that executive appointments had become part of the spoils system for powerful senators. But, as we do so often, we tossed out the baby with the bath water. Determined to end the corruption, Hayes forced his appointments down the Senate\\'s collective throat. Thus Hayes, known to history for the infamous bargain that bought the Presidency at the cost of ending Reconstruction, also largely subdued the Senate as a serious partner in the appointments process.Since that time, Presidents have worked hard to keep their executive appointments away from serious Senate scrutiny. One way to do this is to make recess appointments, intended by the Founders to tide the nation over when the Senate happens not to be in session. Nowadays, Presidents use this dodge to get people into slots the Senate might not let them have. President Obama has made nearly 30 recess appointments in his first two years in office, not an unusually high number these days—unless your baseline is the way the constitutional system of checks and balances is supposed to work. Given the ever-greater likelihood that executive branch and agency nominees will run into trouble, it\\'s easy to see why Presidents yield to the temptation to thwart the constitutional system of checks and balances: They know Congress will never punish them for it.The confirmation process may not be fixable. In the nation\\'s first days, the Senate had to approve fewer than a dozen of the President\\'s aides. Today, more than 500 executive branch posts require Senate confirmation. With politicians, interest groups, journalists, and bloggers engaged in the constant quest for advantage, a few nominees will always become objects of controversy. There are too many contested issues, too many flash points, and—most important—too many constituencies demanding constant signals that their particular concerns are uppermost in the minds of their elected officials.Congress is considering a significant reduction in the number of positions requiring confirmation—an increased centralization of power in the executive that would have appalled the Founders and should appall us, too. A possibility rarely mentioned is to shrink by a significant amount the size and scope of the federal government. A smaller executive branch would mean less need for Senate confirmation. Indeed, the steady rise of confirmation fights in the years after World War II predictably tracks the steady rise of federal agencies. Yet significant shrinkage seems politically unlikely—every agency lives symbiotically with several well-organized interest groups.Yes, it would be lovely if grasping interest groups would stop digging for dirt and hungry politicians would stop grandstanding, but democracy is rarely lovely. Democracy is clamorous and disputatious. The more distant people feel from those who govern them, the louder their clamor to be heard. The clamor does not necessarily lead to right answers or wise decisions. But democracy is a process, not a result.Those loud voices—those out-of-context sound bites, those sudden savagings of the reputations of the innocently qualified—have always been part of our democracy. It\\'s ugly and painful and often unfair. It\\'s also the American way; and with a federal government so vast, interest groups so diverse, and the battle for press coverage so intense, it is likely to get worse.'),\n",

       "  'Five-year-old Wei Ziyun chose “Robot” as his English name after the title character in the Walt Disney (DIS) movie Wall-E. Now a Disney English learning center in Shanghai is teaching him how to spell it. “Robot” and his classmates are learning the colors of the fish on Mickey Mouse’s boat and the articles of clothing Goofy needs when the weather gets cold. They should be more than proficient in English by the time the $4.4 billion Shanghai Disney Resort opens in about five years. “I want to come here every day,” the boy says after one of his twice-weekly lessons. “It’s fun to learn English.”Disney opened its first English-language academy in China in 2008, and demand for English instruction has increased so much that the company has in the past year tripled the number of its schools, to 22. “It’s a very efficient way of marketing their brand as well as the amusement park,” says Shang Yang, chairman of Shangyang Enterprise Management Consulting. “They’re starting years early, brainwashing Chinese children and cultivating them as potential clients in a very indirect, yet penetrative, fashion.”China’s private education market, including international schools, is projected to grow to 517 billion yuan ($79.6 billion) by 2012 from 356 billion yuan in 2009, according to Merrill Lynch (BAC). Andrew Sugerman, Disney English’s general manager, says the market for children’s English-language learning in China may increase 29 percent annually over the next four years from the current 24 billion yuan. Sugerman declined to give financial details about Disney English except to say that it’s profitable. Besides Shanghai, there are learning centers in Beijing, Hangzhou, Nanjing, Ningbo, Tianjin, and Suzhou. Although Disney eventually may expand the business outside the mainland, Sugerman says all the company’s focus currently is geared toward China.“Being surrounded by all sorts of Disney products and characters, it’s almost impossible for children and their parents not to love Disney,” says Wang Bing, an analyst at Phillip Securities Research in Shanghai.The private education market is highly fragmented in China. New Oriental Education & Technology Group (EDU) in Beijing, the nation’s largest operator, had less than a 1 percent share in 2009, according to Merrill Lynch. New Oriental made about $64 million from children’s English training last year, up more than 35 percent from a year earlier, says President Louis Hsieh. He expects New Oriental’s English training program for kids to grow by at least 40 percent during the next couple of years. Learning English is “seen as an absolutely necessary skill to get a good-paying job,” he says.Disney English worked with an academic advisory board to create its Disney Immersive Storytelling Approach, producing more than 300 songs for the program. Sugerman says the curriculum follows standards set by Chinese education ministries. A team of 10 Los Angeles-based staffers creates additional culturally relevant content.Disney charges 3,000 yuan to 12,000 yuan annually for the programs, which include separate curriculums for 2- to 4-year-olds, 3- to 6-year-olds, and primary-school students. Classes typically last 45 minutes and are taught by a native English speaker, certified in teaching English as a foreign language, and a Chinese-speaking assistant. When it’s time to start, kids march down a hallway decorated with characters from Disney films including Bolt and Ratatouille to classrooms filled with references to The Lion King and Mulan, a Disney tale about a Chinese warrior princess.Kids are tested every six weeks on their reading, writing, speaking, and listening comprehension. They also can study at home, with materials featuring characters including Mickey Mouse, Winnie the Pooh, and the gang from the film Monsters, Inc. Says Mary Bergstrom, founder of Bergstrom Group, a Shanghai consultancy: “What Disney is doing now in China is growing a future consumer base.”The bottom line: Disney is using animated characters to grab a piece of the $3.7 billion market in English-language training for kids in China.'),\n",

       "  'When Walt Disney (DIS) releases Cars 2 on June 24, the audience will get a six-minute bonus. Buzz Lightyear, Woody, and other stars of Toy Story 3, another film made by Disney\\'s Pixar animation studio, will romp and joke about Ken and Barbie\\'s failed attempts to hitch a ride to Hawaii inside their owner Andy\\'s book bag. It\\'s more than a warm-up act: The short is intended to help keep sales humming for merchandise based on the Toy Story franchise, which already rivals Disney\\'s Mickey, Minnie, and Winnie the Pooh lines in sales.While movie studios have long run animated shorts before the main attraction in theaters, Toy Story: Hawaiian Vacation marks a bold effort by Disney to capitalize on Americans\\' habit of accumulating toys, lunchboxes, and other consumer goods tied to movies. \"Showing those shorts is a super-smart strategy for Disney,\" says Albie Hecht, former president of Nickelodeon Film & Television Entertainment and founder of Worldwide Biggies, a digital studio that produces films and TV shows for young adults. \"It\\'s a way to extend the characters and the brand without its fans waiting two or three years for a new movie.\"The Toy Story \"Toon,\" as Disney calls it, was created in the 20,000-square-foot DisneyToon Studios that Pixar opened in Vancouver, B.C., in 2010 to make short flicks based on its movies. Disney started making Cars Toons in 2007, running them online, on its cable channels, and occasionally before a feature. That\\'s one reason, says Evercore Partners analyst Alan Gould, that Disney\\'s revenue from Cars merchandise rose 11 percent, to $240 million, in fiscal 2010—four years after the initial Cars movie left theaters. Last year, Disney also packaged the shorts and sold them as a DVD. But the Toy Story franchise is much larger and more financially important to the company.Jim Morris, Pixar\\'s general manager, says the shorts allow Pixar to \"create great entertainment experiences\" while prolonging the brand\\'s relevance. \"Our plan is to keep the Toy Story experience top-of-mind to our consumers between films and to help the franchise,\" he says.The Toy Story short cost $6 million to produce, according to a person with knowledge of the budget. It puts Buzz and Woody back in front of families a year after Toy Story 3\\'s premiere, just as memories might be fading, says Gould. That film grossed $1.06 billion in worldwide ticket sales, according to researcher Box Office Mojo. That makes it Disney\\'s biggest animated film ever and its second-largest overall after Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man\\'s Chest.Disney\\'s estimates peg Toy Story as the fourth-largest merchandise franchise of 2010, after its Mickey Mouse, Pooh, and Princess doll collection and ahead of Mattel\\'s (MAT) Barbie line, Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo told analysts in February. Including sales of licensed products from which Disney gets a fee, Toy Story 3 merchandise will generate more than $7.3 billion at retail, Disney estimates. The company has also installed Toy Story attractions at its theme parks.The earlier Cars Toons may have helped stimulate goodwill for at least one character in the new film, says Steven Levitt, president of Marketing Evaluations, which measures Q Scores—the percentage of people familiar with a product who consider it a favorite. The score for Mater, Cars\\' folksy-talking tow truck, remains a relatively high 47 four years after the first film left theaters, Levitt says—1 point higher than Mickey Mouse. That compares to Bugs Bunny and the M&M candy and Toy Story 3 characters, which were the highest-ranked animated figures, with scores of 52, he says.Pixar plans more Toy Story shorts to keep Buzz and Woody in the spotlight. A second Toon will play before The Muppets, which opens Thanksgiving weekend, the start of the holiday shopping season. The debut of Toy Story: Hawaiian Vacation also comes just weeks before Disney opens its $800 million Aulani resort on Oahu. Disney execs say there\\'s no tie-in, but six minutes of Woody and the gang dreaming of frolicking in paradise can\\'t hurt.The bottom line: Disney estimates Toy Story is the fourth-largest merchandise franchise of 2010. It\\'s bigger than Mickey Mouse and Barbie.'),\n",

       "  'Entertainment conglomerates such as Walt Disney (DIS) spend billions developing popular franchises. However, they\\'ve had mixed success translating those film, television, and theme park characters to smartphones, where more and more eyeballs are glued. The makers of some popular iPhone games are hoping they\\'ll have an easier time going in the opposite direction, and are trying to launch cross-media franchises based on their hit digital characters. \"The new entertainment medium is apps,\" says Paul A. Baldwin, chief marketing officer of Palo Alto (Calif.)-based Outfit7, whose Talking Tom app has been downloaded 50 million times.Helsinki-based Rovio Mobile, with its popular Angry Birds game, may be the best known of the wannabe Disneys. \"Mickey Mouse is one of our role models,\" says Peter Vesterbacka, a co-founder. Rovio and its rivals are now trying to build empires that span toys, clothing, greeting cards, TV shows, and movies. Outfit7\\'s series of talking animal characters, Mind Candy\\'s Moshi Monsters, and Lima Sky\\'s Doodle Jump have each proven popular enough to sell tens of millions of app downloads as well.Outfit7 introduced its hit app Talking Tom last June. It features a gray tabby that drinks milk and purrs when users scratch an iPhone\\'s screen. Ten other talking characters have followed, including Ben, a gruff dog that likes to blow things up in his chemistry lab. Licensing and merchandising opportunities are part of the business plan, not an afterthought, says Baldwin. In 2002, when he was vice-president of marketing at Eidos Interactive, Baldwin struck a first-of-its-kind deal for Creative Artists Agency to represent one of Eidos\\'s video game characters, Lara Croft of the Tomb Raider series. The deal led to two movies starring Angelina Jolie. Talking Tom and Talking Ben will have similar representation, Baldwin says, and four manufacturers have approached him to create a line of plush toys based on Outfit7\\'s characters. He declined to name them because the company is still in negotiations. Last year, Rovio hired former CAA agent Peter Levin to help boost its chances in Hollywood.One of the advantages of building a franchise based on casual smartphone games is that the characters tend to have a broad demographic reach. \"Some of these properties are hitting all age groups, all demographics at once,\" says Michael S. Stone, chief executive officer of brand and trademark management agency Beanstalk Group, which is advising Outfit7 and Mind Candy on licensing deals with traditional media companies. And since 99¢ games require little investment and are often spur-of-the-moment purchases, they spread virally, requiring little formal advertising. \"The big advantage that small companies have is this amazing ecosystem that Apple created,\" says Igor Pusenjak, a co-founder of Lima Sky. \"You get a direct connection to consumers who are more influenced by friends than million-dollar ad campaigns or promotions.\"Mobile entertainment companies can develop new characters for a fraction of what it costs to make a movie. To create Doodle Jump, Pusenjak and his brother Marko invested $1,000 in a laptop, $100 in Apple\\'s (AAPL) software kit for developers, and a few weeks\\' effort. The 99¢ game lets players guide Doodle the Doodler on a journey up a series of platforms, using the tilt controls of the iPhone, iPod touch, or iPad to jump obstacles. Downloaded more than 10 million times, it has spawned a line of T-shirts, mugs, key chains, and posters.Barry Cottle, executive vice-president of video game giant EA Interactive (ERTS), says established entertainment companies like his have the experience necessary to turn an idea into a franchise, \"whereas it\\'s harder for the small developers to get that level of scale quickly.\" At an analyst conference in February, Disney said it was able to generate $7.3 billion in retail sales based on last summer\\'s Toy Story 3.Old and new media have learned to work together in some cases. Twentieth Century Fox partnered with Rovio for a special edition of the Angry Birds game featuring characters from the studio\\'s Rio animated film. For Hop, a Universal Pictures comedy about a rabbit, Lima Sky built a bonus level into Doodle Jump that lets users play as the film\\'s main character. Once there\\'s a relationship between consumers and a character in one medium, \"it\\'s easy to think about extending that into different mediums,\" Baldwin says.The bottom line: Mobile developers are hiring licensing experts and agents to give their characters lives beyond iPhones and a chance at big profits.'),\n",

       "  'Hollywood studio chiefs were all smiles after the Vin Diesel-Dwayne Johnson testosterone fest Fast Five kicked off the summer box-office season with an $86 million opening weekend on Apr. 29. That was Hollywood\\'s biggest debut since November, when the seventh Harry Potter movie took in $125 million. Fast Five also helped shore up hopes for an end to the slump in ticket sales that\\'s dogged the industry since Christmas.\"I think we\\'ve jumpstarted the summer,\" says Nikki Rocco, president of distribution at NBCUniversal\\'s Universal Pictures. \"I\\'m very enthusiastic about what the future looks like for the rest of the year.\"Despite all the Tinseltown buzz, it may be premature to break out the champagne just yet. The industry is starting the key summer movie season—increasingly dependent on teen fare and expensive action and sci-fi blockbusters—about a half-billion dollars behind last year\\'s cumulative box-office level. Through May 1, U.S. motion picture ticket sales were down 14 percent, and attendance was off 15 percent. Studios and theater operators will need a lot more outperforming openings if they are to resume making annual box-office gains after last year\\'s slight drop.The studios also need to keep theatrical revenues growing to counter the continuing decline in home video, long among the most lucrative of a movie-maker\\'s revenue streams. That\\'s one reason why Hollywood is so aggressively pushing 3D and IMAX widescreen versions of this summer\\'s films; moviegoers pay $3 to $6 more per ticket to see those enhanced releases.This year started with optimistic assessments from analysts, including Jeff Bock at Exhibitor Relations, who predicted that the industry\\'s domestic box office (which includes the U.S. and Canada) would hit $11 billion in 2011, up from $10.6 billion in 2010. Underpinning those forecasts are a record nine summer sequels, including installments of Pirates of the Caribbean, Transformers, and the final Harry Potter film, plus new movies such as Universal\\'s Cowboys & Aliens and Paramount Pictures\\' science-fiction flick Super 8 from director J.J. Abrams. Bock is still positive, citing higher ticket prices from 3D and IMAX showings that have helped make up for a longer-term decline in attendance. \"Prospects of $11 billion are good when you look at this summer\\'s slate,\" Bock says. \"If this isn\\'t the biggest summer on record, there really is a problem.\"Hollywood has generated $2.93 billion to date, vs. $3.47 billion at this time last year. Reaching $11 billion \"looks possible,\" says Matthew Harrigan, an analyst at Wunderlich Securities. He says studios and cinema operators will need to outpace last year\\'s record $4.35 billion summer season by about $500 million to eliminate the existing deficit by Labor Day. From there the box office will have to generate an extra $400 million in the fall compared with last year, when the holiday season was dragged down by clunkers like Yogi Bear and The Tourist. \"It\\'s going to be a challenge,\" says Mike Hickey, an analyst with Janco Partners. \"You see a lot of franchises. You may have some fatigue.\"Success at the box office is crucial because studios depend more on theater attendance since consumers are buying fewer DVDs. To adjust to the changing market, most studios closed their specialty divisions, which made smaller niche movies, several years ago and started making fewer, bigger films. That has made their bets on individual movies bigger—especially for sequels, where costs generally go up with each installment as stars demand more. Universal spent $125 million on Fast Five, adding Johnson to the cast, up from $85 million for the fourth Fast & Furious in 2009, according to Box Office Mojo. The last X-Men film in 2009 cost $150 million, double the $75 million production budget of the first one in 2000.To make the summer gamble work, Hollywood needs to get consumers back into the habit of going to the movies—again and again. A major release is planned almost every week, from the May 6 debut of Thor, from Walt Disney\\'s (DIS) Marvel Studios and distributed by Paramount, until the season ends with Shark Night 3-D, distributed by Relativity Media. A disappointing night at the movies can sour the public, says Jeff Blake, vice-chairman of Sony\\'s (SNE) Sony Pictures Entertainment. \"A slump continues because you can\\'t sell the next movie off the current movie,\" he says.Many studio executives think that momentum can be maintained this year because the summer releases include some of the biggest franchises in Hollywood\\'s history. The first three Pirates of the Caribbean films averaged $346 million in the U.S. and Canada, and the seven previous Harry Potter movies averaged $287 million, according to Box Office Mojo. The year also will include at least 34 3D movies, the most ever. Some films, including Thor, will play in both 3D and IMAX. \"Everything I\\'ve heard about the summer slate that we\\'re doing, including the tracking data, makes me more confident,\" says IMAX (IMAX) Chief Executive Officer Rich Gelfond.Theater owners have prepared for the onslaught of 3D films by more than doubling the number of screens equipped for the technology, to 9,609 from 4,001 a year ago, according to the National Association of Theatre Owners. Even so, competition for screens may limit the performance of some movies. Green Lantern, for example, an untested DC Comics-based film from Time Warner\\'s (TWX) Warner Bros., opens June 17, followed by Disney\\'s Cars 2 and Paramount\\'s Transformers: Dark of the Moon. All will compete for those 3D screens. \"It really is an embarrassment of riches,\" Gelfond says. \"You\\'d like to have a little more time.\"The bottom line: Hollywood will roll out big-budget movies almost weekly this summer in an effort to erase a $500 million box-office deficit so far in 2011.'),\n",

       "  '2011-05-05',\n",
       "  'Almost two decades ago, Michele Bachmann, now a third-term Republican representative and founder of the congressional Tea Party Caucus, was a board member at a new public charter school in suburban Minnesota. Soon after the first school year began, unusual reports trickled home to parents. Denise Stephens, whose daughter attended the school at the time, says a teacher banned the Disney movie Aladdin because it depicted magic. Native American dreamweavers were considered inappropriate for an art project. And rumors spread that the board wanted to mandate religious instruction in the classroom.The school district launched an investigation. At a packed public meeting in December 1993, three months after the school opened, Bachmann and the other board members resigned.Bachmann says she never tried to introduce a religious curriculum and that the board stepped down due to a disagreement over the school\\'s academic direction. Yet the incident remains an early indicator of what her supporters and critics alike describe as her instinctive ability to connect with the Republicans\\' conservative, religious base—and draw criticism from nearly everyone else, including the GOP Establishment. \"I am a fighter,\" says Bachmann, 55, who is mulling a bid for President. \"I\\'m not just there to go along and get along.\"Bachmann says that if she runs for the Republican nomination—she\\'ll decide for sure before July—she hopes to win the support of social conservatives in Iowa and South Carolina and fiscal conservatives in New Hampshire. She\\'s already establishing a campaign presence in all three early primary states, she says. \"I think Michele is a serious candidate for President,\" says Vin Weber, a former Republican congressman from Minnesota who is co-chairman of former Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty\\'s Presidential exploratory committee. \"She has an ability to connect with the grassroots conservative base in the country in a way that very few do.\" Bachmann opposes raising the debt ceiling, voted for Representative Paul Ryan\\'s controversial budget, and criticized the intervention in Libya as \"foolish.\" During her 2010 campaign she raised $13.5 million, more than House Speaker John Boehner.What energizes the base can alienate the independent voters whose support makes or breaks a Presidential bid. Bachmann has become famous for controversial comments, including her suggestion in 2008 that Barack Obama may have \"anti-American views\" and her remark in late April that the prospect of cripplingly high taxes is \"similar\" to the Holocaust. Her support for a $633 million bridge over the St. Croix River bordering her district comes as she rails against government spending.Bachmann also has a history of controversial campaigns. In her first bid for public office, she ran for her school board in 1999 as part of a slate of five conservatives endorsed by the Republican Party. During one debate, her opponent, Mary Cecconi, says Bachmann falsely accused her of being endorsed by Planned Parenthood. \"It was just lobbed out there to divert attention,\" says Cecconi, who is the only person to have beat Bachmann.The following year, Bachmann ran for state senate against a moderate Republican who had been a legislator for 28 years. \"You had this weird dynamic of Republicans fighting Republicans,\" says Washington County Commissioner Bill Pulkrabek, who worked on Bachmann\\'s school board and state senate campaigns. \"I\\'ve been in politics maybe 20 years, and I\\'ve only seen it a handful of times.\"The bottom line: Bachmann is well funded and backed by social conservatives. She also has a reputation for intraparty feuds.'),\n",

       "  '2011-04-21',\n",
       "  'Tangled Webs:\\nHow False Statements Are Undermining America:\\nFrom Martha Stewart to Bernie Madoff\\nBy James B. Stewart\\nPenguin Press; 496 pp; $29.95\\n Eight years ago, before he became a senator and full-time serious person, Al Franken published a book called Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them. This would actually make a better title for James B. Stewart\\'s engrossing new book than the drab, finger-wagging one it\\'s been assigned. For what Stewart has put together is less a fretful rumination on this country\\'s moral failings than it is an extraordinary forensic analysis of the high-stakes American liar.Stewart\\'s CV already includes two masterworks about executive-suite hubris: Disney War and Den of Thieves, the latter an appraisal of the Boesky-Milken era of insider trading. Here, Stewart takes four oppressively familiar news stories from the last decade—Martha Stewart\\'s ImClone (IMCL) stock caper; I. Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby\\'s complicity in blowing the cover of the CIA operative Valerie Plame; Barry Bonds\\'s involvement with Balco, a Bay Area business that distributed steroids; and Bernard Madoff\\'s epic Ponzi scheme—and reconstructs them afresh by reporting the dickens out of them.In Stewart\\'s view, these stories are proof that we\\'re living through a sustained bull market for liars, and \"that the broad public commitment to telling the truth under oath has been breaking down, eroding over recent decades.\" Current headlines suggest he\\'s on to something. Both Bonds, the former slugger, and Raj Rajaratnam, the former hedge-fund guru, have just stood trial for alleged untruth-related misdeeds: Bonds for perjury and Rajaratnam for insider trading. Even Warren Buffett, the conscientious grandpa of American investing, has been saying things lately that strain the bounds of credulity, if not legality. Can he be serious that the resignation of his putative Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) heir apparent, David Sokol, came as \"a total surprise\"? This, after it came to light that Sokol had in January purchased a $10 million stake in a company that Berkshire bought outright just weeks later?Much will be made of the bombshells contained within Tangled Webs—particularly Stewart\\'s contention that Karl Rove lied to President George W. Bush when asked if he was a source for the Robert Novak column that outed Plame. Stewart further reveals that State Dept. official Richard Armitage was as culpable as Libby in leaking Plame\\'s name, and, like Rove, only narrowly avoided indictment. On the Madoff front, Stewart documents how a young Securities and Exchange Commission lawyer came within one phone call of uncovering the Ponzi scheme in 2006. Alas, between the lawyer\\'s inexperience and her supervisors\\' indifference, she wasn\\'t prepped to ask the right questions of the body she was calling—the Depository Trust Co., which Madoff said cleared his \"trades\"—and the matter was let go.The book is most impressive, however, on the granular level. Drawing upon transcripts of grand jury testimony and notes taken by FBI agents and other federal investigators—information unsealed in the course of judicial proceedings or through the author\\'s own Freedom of Information Act requests—Stewart is able to get up close to his protagonists to provide, he says, \"a rare look at the very moment these people made the fateful choice to lie.\"This is tweezer journalism at its finest. The Martha Stewart segment is especially magnificent, with author Stewart carefully assembling a tapestry of facts that allows us to witness, hour by hour, almost minute by minute, the actions that ultimately landed the domestic diva in jail. We see Peter Bacanovic, Martha\\'s broker at Merrill Lynch, ordering his young assistant, Douglas Faneuil, to convey to Martha the news that another Bacanovic client, Sam Waksal, was trying to sell all the shares in the company he runs, ImClone. (It is Dec. 27, 2001, and Waksal knows that the Food & Drug Administration is not going to approve the cancer drug upon which he has staked ImClone\\'s fortunes.) We see Martha calling Bacanovic\\'s office from San Antonio, where her private plane is refueling en route to a post-Christmas vacation in Mexico. We hear her order Faneuil to sell all her shares in ImClone.By the time the SEC is on her trail, Martha and Bacanovic have put together a story that the sale was the result of a preexisting agreement to unload her ImClone shares if the stock price ever dipped below $60. Martha tells this story in a January 2002 interview with lawyers from the Justice Dept. and the SEC, adding that she, Bacanovic, and one of her bookkeepers concur that they all have the same recollection of the $60 agreement. But this is after she has already said she\\'s had just one conversation with Bacanovic about ImClone since the sale—and that the stock trade never came up. After a lawyer pounces on the gaffe, Martha grows huffy, saying \"Can I go now? I have a business to run.\" And the plot thickens.Throughout Tangled Webs, the protagonists determinedly dig themselves in deeper. Had Martha Stewart and Bacanovic owned up to the ImClone share-dump, both might have avoided jail. Bonds was granted full immunity in exchange for truthful testimony by federal prosecutors in 2003; their quarry was not him but his trainer, Greg Anderson, and Balco executives Victor Conte and James Valente. Had Bonds admitted to steroid use in his grand jury testimony, as his fellow ballplayer Jason Giambi did, he might still be playing, as Giambi is, rather than spending his days awaiting sentencing.The one component of Tangled Webs that doesn\\'t quite persuade is its argumentative framework. Stewart avers, rather melodramatically, that \"we appear to be on the brink of becoming a society where perjury is the norm.\" That\\'s a bit much. Isn\\'t it entirely possible that lying under oath is not so much on the upswing, but, like autism and food allergies in children, just more frequently diagnosed than it used to be? (Which isn\\'t to equate autism or food allergies with perjury, by the way.) There were no SEC investigations prior to 1934 because there was no SEC. The paper trails were shorter, the electronic trails nonexistent. Who\\'s to say that the high-profile defendants of the gaslight era weren\\'t bigger liars than those we see today?The better case that Stewart makes is that perjury, as fundamentally serious a crime as it is, isn\\'t treated like one. There\\'s a telling moment in the Libby segment in which all of Washington knows his perjury indictment is about to be handed down, and Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Tex.) goes on Meet the Press to vent to Tim Russert. \"I certainly hope,\" she says, \"that if there is going to be an indictment that says something happened, that it is an indictment on a crime and not some perjury technicality.\"The meager consequences of perjury reinforce this \"technicality\" mentality. Martha Stewart was sentenced to five months in prison and five months of house arrest. Libby got 30 months and a fine of $250,000, but President Bush commuted the prison part of the sentence. The SEC knew Madoff was lying to them under oath in 2006 about the nature of some of his supposed trades—a felony offense in and of itself—but because they didn\\'t uncover a heavier underlying crime, they closed their investigation.The eight-years-in-the-making Bonds case, a hangover from the juiceball era, is, in Stewart\\'s view, an indication of how flummoxing perjury and false statements are to our legal system. \"They essentially paralyze it and render it dysfunctional,\" he says. Indeed, we still have Roger Clemens\\'s perjury trial coming up in July. And anyone who says he\\'s looking forward to that is a liar.'),\n",

       "  'There were signs aplenty that the Apr. 8 groundbreaking for the $4.4 billion Shanghai Disney Resort wasn\\'t aimed at the typical Orlando vacationer. Shanghai school children sang When You Wish Upon a Star—in Mandarin. Mickey Mouse showed up clad not in his signature duds but in traditional red Chinese garb to symbolize good fortune. Everything was customized to suit the tastes of the world\\'s most populous nation.Walt Disney (DIS) has good reason to sweat the details at its first theme park on the mainland. When it opened Hong Kong Disneyland in 2005, it underestimated how many visitors would show up and how long they would linger. The result: too few rides, inadequate seating and food supplies at restaurants, and angry crowds that had to be turned away. Although the 47 percent Disney-owned Hong Kong park is expanding, it still lost $92.3 million in the year ended last October, while attendance rose 13 percent. \"We learned a lot from Hong Kong,\" says Disney Chief Executive Officer Robert A. Iger. \"In Shanghai, we\\'re within a three hour\\'s drive of 300 million people. That\\'s a huge opportunity, and we have to be careful about how many will come and their visitation patterns.\"For Disney, which will own a 43 percent stake in the 963-acre resort (three state-owned companies own the rest), Shanghai is a $1.9 billion wager on a growing Chinese middle class who the company projects will spend $200 billion annually on leisure travel by 2015. It\\'s also a bet that Disney\\'s characters and 55-year history of running theme parks can be adapted to a culture it may not fully understand. Disney \"has too much riding on China to let either Hong Kong or Shanghai fail,\" says John Gerner, managing director of Leisure Business Advisors, which assessed the potential for theme parks in China for Village Roadshow, an Australian theater and park operator. \"Hong Kong was an experiment to see if a smaller park would work, and it didn\\'t. Now they\\'re fixing it.\"Shanghai\\'s Disneyland will be almost 85 acres, about 50 percent larger than the Hong Kong park at its opening, says one executive. There will be traditional Disney rides and others based on Chinese culture, says Iger. The company is adding Chinese nationals to its \"imagineering\" team to help develop the park. One staple that will change: Main Street USA, the turn-of-the-century collection of storefronts and horse-drawn street cars that welcome visitors to most Disney parks. Explains Iger: \"We simply believe Main Street USA might not be that interesting to people here.\"Disney isn\\'t likely to repeat the cultural faux pas it made when it opened Disneyland Resort Paris in 1992, where food sales suffered because the park initially didn\\'t serve wine with meals. In Hong Kong, Disney has cut the number of hot dogs in its restaurants in order to serve more dim sum and noodle dishes, says a Disney executive, and there is likely to be plenty of local fare in Shanghai. \"Disney is paying a lot more attention now to cultural differences,\" say Evercore Partners (EVR) analyst Alan Gould. One motivation: The Shanghai park will generate $70 million in management fees for Disney in its first year and $200 million within a decade, Gould estimates.The bottom line: Disney, which already provides its TV shows to 260 million viewers in China each week, is betting on mainland theme parks.'),\n",

       "  'Richard Beckman says he\\'s not particularly fond of Mad Dog, a nickname he earned as a sales executive at Condé Nast, the magazine publisher where he spent 24 years. He finds it demeaning, and says it is belied by the fact that he is actually shy and quiet. In several meetings, he does display an almost theatrical delicacy in the way he speaks and gestures, rotating his wrists in the florid manner of a magician. But there is a note of canine aggression in his voice when he calls from Aspen on Friday, Mar. 18. He is supposed to be on vacation, skiing with his family, but instead he\\'s spent the day in crisis mode, his ear attached to his cell phone talking to his editors, magazine publishers, and his company\\'s publicist. The New York Post has just printed a story declaring that investors in Beckman\\'s one-year-old company, Prometheus Global Media, which owns The Hollywood Reporter, Adweek, Billboard, and other trade magazines, are scrambling to get out of their investment. For a man trying to reinvent an Old Media business, the last thing you want to read is that when your company forked over $70 million for eight publications in 2009, it \"overpaid\"—even when it\\'s coming from an unnamed source in a newspaper that isn\\'t necessarily known for its accuracy. Since Beckman and the investment partners issued firm public denials to the Post, who could the source possibly be? \"I have no idea,\" he says, \"but I\\'d love to wring their neck if I could find out.\"The English-born Beckman is an archetype from a period that may never return, if it ever really existed: a salesman who made money fall from the sky during glossy magazines\\' heyday, accustomed to living high and celebrating his rough edges, if not his nickname. For decades he was among those responsible for turning magazines such as Vanity Fair, GQ, and Vogue into cash machines for Condé Nast, which publishes those titles and a long list of others. Now, Beckman has moved on from that magazine empire\\'s glamorous Times Square cocoon of Town Cars and expense accounts and spends his days in far more modest offices downtown. (After suffering through a brutal ad recession, Condé Nast has moved on, too.) With Prometheus, Beckman is trying to repeat his success within the least glamorous sector of publishing—trade magazines—at a time when print has practically been given up for dead in some quarters. Not only is $70 million of other people\\'s money at stake; so, it seems, is Beckman\\'s reputation and the sense that he can be a successful visionary on his own.\"I really want to make a mark, but don\\'t feel I have to the degree that I\\'d like to,\" he says. \"I can look at myself and know I\\'m a good person, but there are things I\\'d like to achieve that I haven\\'t yet.\" He has been bruised by stories like one particularly nasty column that ran in The New York Observer last year, which posited that he was an \"irrelevant\" figure at Condé Nast whose departure prompted \"parties in the hallways,\" and by more recent blog posts suggesting his new venture is hemorrhaging money. For someone who\\'s been called a bully, Beckman has a surprisingly fragile ego. \"I couldn\\'t bring myself to read it,\" he says of the Observer piece. \"I was so upset.\"\"I\\'m a fierce competitor,\" he continues. \"I can tell you, no matter how many caustic articles that they write about me or my team or these businesses, that we will prevail and it will be at their expense.\"\\n\\n\\n\"B-to-I,\" Beckman says with a twinkle-eyed smile. \"I should have trademarked that.\"Beckman is in full salesman mode. Rather than running a business that primarily services consumers, such as Vanity Fair, or a media business that services another business, such as Variety, Beckman claims he\\'s invented a new category of audience. \"Business-to-influencer means your product is talking to not just the industry but also to that top-of-the-pyramid consumer who follows those industries,\" he says. It\\'s a pitch he\\'s promoting in a highly produced video for potential advertisers, featuring actors and movie producers whose names I must promise not to disclose, who wax on about the massive cultural influence of Hollywood and how The Hollywood Reporter is synonymous with that influence.The B-to-I pitch is meant to entice consumer advertisers that otherwise would never consider buying ads in such a low-circulation publication. After Prometheus bought The Hollywood Reporter, paid circulation of the daily was reported by BPA Worldwide to be just over 12,000. Since relaunching it as a weekly, Beckman says circulation is 72,000, but he refuses to disclose the breakdown of paid vs. free subscriptions. These 72,000 people—the influencers—are pretty much the best 72,000 people any advertiser could dream of reaching, he says. While most of Beckman\\'s energy has been focused on The Hollywood Reporter thus far, he hopes to apply his approach to Prometheus\\'s other publications as well.Printers\\' ink runs through the veins of all four men who in 2009 sought to buy The Hollywood Reporter and seven other barely profitable publications, including Billboard, Adweek, Brandweek, and Mediaweek, from Nielsen. The deal\\'s mastermind was James \"Jimmy\" Finkelstein, the chairman of News Communications, which owns the paid biographical listing service Marquis Who\\'s Who. Finkelstein also owns the Washington-based political paper The Hill, begun by his father, Jerry, who also owned The New York Law Journal. Jimmy Finkelstein is also chairman of Pluribus Capital, which he formed in 2009 to buy media properties.Joining Finkelstein at Pluribus was George Green, a former chief executive officer of The New Yorker and longtime president of Hearst Magazines International. The third member of the Pluribus troika, Matthew Doull, started his career as a cub reporter at London\\'s Telegraph, owned at the time by his step-uncle, the fallen media baron Conrad Black. Doull eventually joined the business side of Black\\'s company running its investing arm, Hollinger Capital. In mid-2009, Finkelstein discovered that Nielsen was interested in selling its business media properties in advance of an initial public offering. Along with Green and Doull, he prepared to make an offer. In addition, a critical member of the team was Lachlan Murdoch, the eldest son of Rupert. After leaving his father\\'s company, News Corp. (NWS), in 2005, Murdoch had founded Illyria, a private equity firm that invested almost exclusively in Australian media companies. According to a person familiar with the negotiations, Murdoch and Finkelstein\\'s Pluribus were planning to share the burden of financing the $70 million price tag equally. Murdoch did not respond to requests for comment.Beckman, meanwhile, was plotting his departure from Condé Nast. He had recently become president of its Fairchild Fashion Group division, a $75 million unit that included fashion magazine W, as well as trade magazines such as Women\\'s Wear Daily and Footwear News. It had been underperforming, and Beckman\\'s assignment was seen as a mandate to fix a broken business. He also began having discussions with Todd Boehly, managing partner of investment firm Guggenheim Partners, which has been headed by former Bear Stearns CEO Alan Schwartz since 2009. Beckman and Boehly hatched a plan to buy Fairchild from Condé Nast Chairman Si Newhouse, but Newhouse wasn\\'t interested in parting with the company for an amount that wouldn\\'t come close to the $650 million he\\'d paid to buy it from Disney (DIS) a decade earlier.In late 2009, not long after those discussions fell apart, Murdoch backed out of the Nielsen purchase. Beckman, who says he and Boehly had been looking at Nielsen independently, heard that Finkelstein\\'s team was interested, too. Pluribus had a deal in place but needed money, and Guggenheim had billions and wanted media properties. \"I brokered that marriage a little bit,\" Beckman says. In December 2009 it became official.As much as Beckman likes to say he wishes he\\'d trademarked B-to-I, influencer is a well-traveled marketing buzzword. Beckman unveiled his version at a big presentation to Fairchild\\'s staff, where he laid out how the company would be retooling its products beyond business-to-business and into a realm where influencers who loved fashion would be targeted alongside people wheeling clothing racks through the garment district. It was a slick pitch, but one that seemed oddly out of sync for most of Fairchild\\'s titles.Of course, Beckman\\'s Fairchild plans proved moot. He left to become the head of Prometheus, which was initially called e5 Global Media. In May 2010 he shocked the recession-battered media industry when he announced that he\\'d hired Janice Min, who had made a seven-figure salary in her previous job as editor of Us Weekly, to be the editorial director of The Hollywood Reporter. Min would be turning the Reporter into a weekly, and Beckman proclaimed he would lure beauty, fashion, consumer electronics, and liquor ads into the publication for the first time. The design firm Razorfish was brought in to revamp the website. The staff of 45 grew to 65.Then Beckman approached Vanity Fair columnist Michael Wolff about taking over Adweek. While most magazines were laying people off in droves, Beckman was spending like it was 1999. \"I said, \\'I don\\'t think you can afford me, Richard,\\'\" Wolff recalls. \"And it turned out that he could afford me. He offered that ineffable combination of flattery and money.\" Beckman told Wolff he wanted to invest in a thorough overhauling of Adweek, which had been making about $2 million a year, according to a member of its previous management. (Beckman evidently overlooked the fact that his new editor is also the author of Burn Rate: How I Survived the Gold Rush Years of the Internet, an account of reckless venture capital spending in the 1990s—including his own.)Adweek will relaunch later this month with a bulked-up staff. The business model it will emulate is that of Politico, a privately-owned product that is primarily known for the political news it breaks on its website, but believed to be profitable because of its small-circulation daily print version, which is full of expensive ads from lobbyists and other companies that hope to reach the influential Washingtonians who receive it. Wolff hopes Adweek.com will become the go-to site for media news and that the extensive reporting manpower required will be paid for by ads in a much smaller-circulation weekly magazine (which, unlike Politico, which is distributed free, costs $299 for print and digital access, according to its website).As well as making big hires, Beckman made a few formidable enemies. Before Beckman settled on Min, Doull approached Sharon Waxman, editor of the website TheWrap, about The Hollywood Reporter job. Boehly also conducted extensive talks about the position with Nikki Finke, the famously reclusive and feared editor of Deadline Hollywood, a movie industry site. In March, news that Finke had been offered the job made it onto Waxman\\'s website. Most people in Hollywood do their best to avoid Finke\\'s wrath. Beckman, however, chose to issue a statement that there was \"no truth to the report\" of the job offer. On her blog, Finke said she\\'d been offered a $450,000 salary, an estimated $650,000 a year for a share of anticipated cable TV deals, and a $1 million Malibu condo. Boehly doesn\\'t deny that such a conversation took place but parses the meaning of the word \"offer.\" \"When you\\'re in the deal business like I am, an offer is very formal and very rigid,\" he says, adding, \"When you\\'re in kindergarten and you\\'re trying to make friends with someone and someone asks you, \\'Can you help me with my homework assignment\\' and you say, \\'O.K., I\\'ll consider it,\\' is that an offer?\" Finke declined to comment for the record.After angering his new industry\\'s two most prominent bloggers, Beckman then proceeded to insult his new staff in an interview with The New York Times by demeaning the work of The Hollywood Reporter employees inherited by Prometheus. \"It\\'s our negligence—the way we served up our content over the last couple years has allowed some really poor competitors to emerge,\" he said. \"But we\\'re going to rectify that starting right now.\" In another interview he took a shot at one of those rivals: \"If I\\'m setting the bar where Variety is—and this is going to sound really caustic—I\\'m setting the bar too low.\" It was like moving into an unfamiliar Hollywood neighborhood and cranking up a dozen leaf blowers.\\n\\n\\nWith a thud, Beckman plunks down the first issue of the redesigned Hollywood Reporter. It\\'s November, and the magazine just hit newsstands. It looks expensive. It features a glossy Vanity Fair-like cover featuring a group of actresses including Natalie Portman and Nicole Kidman. But the real point of pride for Beckman has to be that it is 156 pages thick with 67 pages of advertisements. Along with the ads that have long been the bread and butter of the trades, such as the page HBO bought to congratulate Laura Dern, Diane Lane, and Bruce Dern for their Hollywood Walk of Fame stars, there are consumer advertisements that have rarely been seen in either The Hollywood Reporter or Variety: Versace, Citibank (C), Lancôme, Möet.Over courses of prosciutto and cheese, roasted chicken, and Italian white wine at Da Silvano, a Manhattan restaurant, Beckman tells stories of the lost world of New York publishing and the giants of Condé Nast—men he loved and admired. Among them was Art Cooper, GQ\\'s legendary editor-in-chief and practitioner of the good life, who loved to smoke and enjoyed heavy, boozy business lunches—and who dropped dead in the middle of one such lunch at the Four Seasons in 2003, a few months after retiring. As publisher of GQ from 1995-\\'98, Beckman helped turn it into a publication whose ad-stuffed girth rivaled that of Condé Nast\\'s perennial cash cow, Vogue.He loved Steve Florio more than anyone. The former Condé Nast CEO imported Beckman from the London office and made him his protégé. Florio had been the founder of the annual \"Italian guys\" lunch—Condé Nast\\'s clique of bespoke-suited, tough-talking ad sales executives such as Ron \"Mr. Big\" Galotti and Florio\\'s brother Tom. Beckman, who grew up Jewish in middle-class northwest London, the son of an accountant and schoolteacher, was judged close enough to be made an honorary \"Italian guy\" and was given a seat at the table. (The final Italian guys lunch was held in early 2008—at Da Silvano—just a few months after Florio died of a heart attack. Only 58, he had been relieved of his CEO job three years before.)Beckman eventually became president of Condé Nast Media Group, a department that superseded the magazines\\' publishers and sold ad pages directly to the biggest advertisers, those with budgets to advertise across most or all of the Condé Nast titles. As a testament to his value, Beckman had been given the job even after a highly publicized incident in 1999: During a booze-soaked sales meeting in Los Angeles when he was publisher of Vogue, he\\'d forcefully encouraged one female advertising executive to kiss the magazine\\'s international editor. The two women collided, and the sales executive was injured badly enough that she told Condé Nast she required surgery and claimed the incident was part of \"a pattern of questionable behavior\" by Beckman. Condé Nast settled for more than $1 million and issued a statement saying Beckman \"acknowledges some inappropriate behavior on his part and is seeking counseling to address that issue.\" Because of the settlement, Beckman can\\'t talk about the incident.It was in his position leading Condé Nast corporate that Beckman solidified his status as someone not to be trifled with. He developed a reputation for yelling at employees and for executing petty power plays, such as making his staff wait for him for hours. \"He\\'s nuts, he\\'s fun, and he\\'s extremely, extremely aggressive,\" says David Penski, the president of ad-buying agency ZenithOptimedia, who negotiated with Beckman on behalf of a number of advertising clients over the years. \"He has a very large ego and he wants things done his way, period.\" Says Beckman\\'s friend L.A. Reid, former head of Island Def Jam records: \"He\\'s awfully charismatic, but I\\'ve also seen Richard get upset, with, like, smoke coming out of his ears.\"Advertisers liked him and feared him. \"There are very few people who can call any single agency president and get a meeting in five minutes,\" Penski says. \"He\\'s one of them.\" As ad dollars began migrating to the Internet in the mid-2000s and other magazines began dropping their print ad rates, Beckman insisted on raising rates every year. Advertisers had no choice but to pay; in terms of reaching large numbers of well-heeled consumers, no other publisher could touch Condé Nast. \"There was that underlying feeling that if you were a luxury brand and you stopped advertising in Condé Nast books, that was going to hurt you from an editorial perspective,\" says Penski, who cites no examples. For the Chanels of the world, Beckman was unavoidable, like the ferryman at the River Styx. Condé Nast did not respond to a request for comment. Says Beckman: \"Condé Nast always operated with a church and state philosophy, that we would never allow commercial support to influence editorial coverage.\"He remained in his perch for eight years, longer than any who\\'d held the position before. Yet as much power as he had, Beckman felt stymied in his efforts to influence operations, telling friends he felt that Newhouse and Condé Nast had been shortsighted in relying entirely on the sale of print ads, a business vulnerable to recession. The financial meltdown of 2008 vindicated those fears. It crushed the advertising market, and for the first time in memory, Condé Nast lost money.Beckman had never made a secret of his desire to be CEO. \"That company believed in me before I believed in myself, and I was very proud of everything I achieved there,\" he says. \"But in my last year or two there was a real sense for me that I thought my job at that company was done. And Chuck [Townsend, the CEO] wasn\\'t going anywhere.\" Beckman landed at Fairchild, and in a further blow to his ego, the press treated his new job as a huge demotion. In the wake of the financial meltdown, the company also canceled his real pride and joy—the multimedia extravaganza that he had dreamed up, Fashion Rocks. He was about to turn 50. His mother was dying of cancer. It was in this battered headspace that he set out for Prometheus.\\n\\n\\nIt takes months before Beckman\\'s schedule allows for a long-promised whiteboard presentation of Prometheus\\'s master plan. The company\\'s Broadway offices have dingy, pockmarked walls and a pile of old, broken computers lying in a hallway. Beckman\\'s office is by comparison the retreat of a pasha: dark wooden Venetian blinds, overstuffed leather chairs, a marble desktop, a blue guitar given to him by Carlos Santana mounted on the wall, and a large bronze sculpture of a knight on horseback, a gift from his wife, Kristen, when he became publisher of Vogue in 1998. \"I\\'m obsessed with knights,\" he says. \"They were the most fierce warriors, right? But they had an incredible code of integrity, chivalry.\" Beckman, who travels frequently, is not seen by employees in the office very much. You can tell he\\'s in when classic rock such as David Bowie and Queen\\'s Under Pressure is blaring.No whiteboard is in evidence. There is, however, a 60-inch plasma screen tuned to soccer with the sound down. Beckman seems unable to concentrate. Mid-conversation, he keeps trailing off as his eyes settle on the game. His favorite team, the Tottenham Spurs, is minutes from winning, the first time they\\'ve been in contention to take the European Cup, but his eyes look despondent. \"I\\'m really upset about the call I just had,\" he explains. He\\'d been at the Grammys over the weekend, he says, trying to persuade an unnamed artist to perform at the Billboard Music Awards, the struggling program he now owns and hopes to reinvigorate on May 22 in Las Vegas. ABC will broadcast the show, and he has booked premier acts such as The Black Eyed Peas, Rihanna, and Jennifer Lopez—but apparently they are not enough.The bookings are killing him: \"When a client tells you if you do this, this, this, this, and this, and you do all they ask, you walk through a burning building, and you have a conference call set up on the Tuesday just to tell them how happy you are you\\'re able to achieve all these things. Then they say they changed their mind.\" He stops, shakes his head. \"It\\'s just not what I would regard as integrity in business dealings, and it pisses you off.\" Beckman admits he\\'s prone to black moods, feelings of intense self-doubt. \"I probably have imposter syndrome, thinking I have people fooled. It\\'s probably what drives me,\" he says. \"Oh, my God. Living inside my own head is tough. I\\'m a tortured soul.\"The Hollywood Reporter has been embraced by the Hollywood community. \"The product\\'s pretty good,\" says Bob Dowling, a former publisher of The Hollywood Reporter, who oversaw one of its most lucrative periods, from 1988 to 2005. \"But you can always come up with something that\\'s fantastic as long as somebody else is paying for it forever. \"The Mar. 25 issue is a good-looking, 64 glossy pages, but it\\'s a far cry from the premier issue. The first ad on the inside cover is a house ad for Prometheus\\'s new Reality Rocks Expo, a trade show for people who want to make or appear in reality TV shows. The 15 pages of other ads are almost all so-called endemic ads, various entities wishing Bryan Adams congratulations on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and so forth. The \"beauty, fashion, consumer electronics, and liquor\" ads that Beckman promised and had in the first issues are nowhere to be seen. \"He got them to begin with because everyone owed him a favor,\" says Penski. \"And I think that he\\'s struggling as these companies are struggling, too.\"Dowling finds Beckman\\'s notion that there\\'s something novel about a trade publication trying to lure consumer advertising amusing. \"You honestly think that we didn\\'t think of that?\" he says. \"The Hollywood Reporter had a monthly magazine in the mid-\\'80s. Guess what they were trying to do? Get consumer advertising. That didn\\'t work. There was V Life, that didn\\'t work. There was Premiere Magazine, that didn\\'t work. There was American Film Monthly, that didn\\'t work. Why? No advertising.\" Beckman has never heard of Dowling, but when confronted with his logic, he counters with his B-to-I argument. \"Our magazine provides access to the most influential constituent in the entertainment space,\" he says. He says that THR has broken even on every issue, advertising is up 50 percent since the launch, and that Web traffic has ballooned more than 800 percent since he took over. \"Overall, I\\'m very pleased with the first 15 months,\" he says. \"But no one is popping the champagne corks. We\\'ve got a lot of wood to chop, a lot of things to do.\"When Beckman finally presents his whiteboard, which has been jammed into his office, it is filled with grand ideas to take dusty but great brands and launch them into the stratosphere. There\\'s an Adweek reality show, a Billboard-branded partnership with MySpace for unsigned bands, a DirecTV (DTV)-based Billboard Music Channel. Beckman says there are serious talks for a Hollywood Reporter edition for Bollywood. \"I was just back from New Delhi,\" he says. \"I was on the phone before you came in with a principal of one of the larger media companies over there. We are interested in taking the global influence of the entertainment industry to other countries.\"A person familiar with the finances of the operation estimates that Prometheus is on track to lose as much as $10 million a year. \"Nonsense,\" Beckman says. \"We were profitable in 2010, and profits will increase in 2011.\" Even if The Hollywood Reporter was losing tons, it wouldn\\'t necessarily mean it was a failed experiment; Vanity Fair was initially a big money loser upon its relaunch in 1983.The financial health of the magazines might be beside the point. \"You\\'ve got to look at it from a Wall Street perspective,\" says Ross Johnson, a former THR business reporter who is now a prominent Hollywood public-relations consultant. \"This is the kind of play that private equity guys love.\" Neil Stiles, president of Variety Inc., says he can\\'t make Beckman\\'s math work but also wonders if Prometheus might have less immediate motivations than turning a profit on its magazines. \"What they\\'re clearly about is asset value, not P&L,\" Stiles says. \"That\\'s the stunning thing about private equity. You don\\'t actually have to make a profit, you just have to look like you might one day, and then you sell to another private equity firm. It\\'s sort of like a Pass the Parcel game at a children\\'s birthday party, but instead of passing a nice present, you\\'re passing an explosive device. The last private equity firm ends up getting their face blown off.\"Whatever happens, Beckman is clearly a man who wants his story not to end with Condé Nast and all that happened there. Auspiciously, Prometheus is named not only for the Greek god who brought men fire but also had his liver eaten over and over again by a giant eagle while chained to a rock—Beckman is a man who places great value in symbols. He\\'s wearing the same silver bulldog cuff links today that he wore at our last meeting, which makes me wonder if he\\'s really that opposed to the Mad Dog label. He shakes his head, and says they\\'re in honor of his 6-year-old son\\'s beloved stuffed animal. \"When we were shopping once, he saw these cuff links and he said, \\'Daddy, Dog-Dog cuff links.\\' So I bought them.\" Is Mad Dog really such a bad nickname? \"Some people say I should embrace the dog,\" he says. \"But it\\'s not pleasant, the way some people articulate it. It\\'s related to my tenacity and my persistence, but I also would like to think it relates to my loyalty. I spent 24 years at Condé Nast. This is only the third job of my life.\"'),\n",
       " (\"Aetna's Rx for High Doctor Fees: Lawsuits\",\n",
       "  '2011-03-31',\n",
       "  'In 2007 cardiologist Benyamin Hannallah charged $220 to evaluate patients admitted to the hospital where he worked, Jersey City Medical Center, across the river from New York. Then he opened his own practice and raised his fee for the 25-minute bedside consultation to $56,980, according to a lawsuit filed by Aetna (AET). The health insurer is suing Hannallah and five other New Jersey doctors for charging what Aetna calls \"unconscionable\" fees to treat patients admitted at four New Jersey hospitals.The lawsuits could help determine what pricing limits insurers can impose on out-of-network physicians who don\\'t have contracts with health plans that set how much a service or procedure can cost. \"It\\'s the uninvited guest who comes into your hospital room and then bills you and your health plan for outrageous, undisclosed amounts,\" says J. Edward Neugebauer, Aetna\\'s chief of litigation.The complaints provide a glimpse of the sums physicians earn from an insurer and the huge variations in how much different doctors charge and receive for the same services. Hannallah billed $59,490 for a cardiac ultrasound, which typically earns Aetna\\'s in-network doctors in Jersey City $74, says Aetna spokeswoman Cynthia Michener. Another defendant, obstetrician Waleed Abdelghani, charged $30,000 for a Caesarean birth, or more than 10 times the in-network fee Aetna quotes, Aetna claims. \"If these charges are accurate, consumers and purchasers should be outraged,\" says David Lansky, president of the Pacific Business Group on Health in San Francisco, a coalition of health insurance buyers that includes Chevron (CVX), Walt Disney (DIS), and General Electric (GE). Lawyers for the doctors declined to comment on specific charges in the suits and said their clients did nothing wrong.Aetna tried in 2007 to impose caps on some out-of-network payments, prompting doctors\\' complaints to the New Jersey Banking and Insurance Dept. The agency fined the insurer $2.5 million for violating consumer-protection laws by failing to reimburse enough for HMO patients, and ordered it to pay out-of-network practitioners enough so that patients would be asked for no more than their co-pays.In 2009, Aetna, UnitedHealth Group (UNH), Cigna (CI), and WellPoint (WLP) were accused by the New York attorney general of underpaying out-of-network physicians by manipulating a database used to calculate payments. They paid a total of $90 million in settlements without admitting wrongdoing. UnitedHealth, again without admitting wrongdoing, agreed that year to pay $350 million to settle a lawsuit by the American Medical Assn. over the same issues. Similar AMA lawsuits against Aetna, Cigna, and WellPoint are pending.The Aetna lawsuits, filed over the past eight months, allege the defendants violated New Jersey State Board of Medical Examiners rules against excessive fees and seek triple damages under state insurance fraud laws against filing false or misleading claims. Cardiologist Hannallah charged $59,490 for a heart ultrasound in April 2010 and was paid $47,592, the suit says. In April 2010, Hannallah asked for $54,600 for a heart catheterization, Aetna said, up from $5,500 for the same procedure in 2007. When the insurer gave him $2,000—a sum it deemed \"usual and customary\" for the procedure—Hannallah complained. Aetna paid in full to prevent him from billing the patient for the remainder, Michener says. The insurer says it paid Hannallah a total of $3.2 million in 2008 and 2009, up from $529,503 in the prior two-year period.Robert Conroy, Hannallah\\'s lawyer, says Aetna\\'s description of some of the fees in its complaint are false or misleading. Some charges cited were pre-approved by the insurer, he says, and some were negotiated between Hannallah and a third party representing Aetna.In its suit against Deepak Srinivasan, a cardiologist at Hackensack University Medical Center, Aetna claims the doctor raised his fee for heart catheterizations to $18,720 in 2007 from $3,000 in 2006. His income from Aetna rose to $2.5 million in 2008, from $155,310 in 2006, the suit says. George Frino, Srinivasan\\'s attorney, says Aetna agreed to his fee schedule as an out-of-network practitioner in 2007. Srinivasan filed a countersuit alleging that Aetna, by not paying him what it owes, violated laws governing group health plans and committed mail and wire fraud in its reimbursement practices. Aetna\\'s Michener calls Srinivasan\\'s counterclaim \"unfounded.\"Abdelghani, who also practices at the Hackensack (N.J.) hospital, increased his Caesarean charge to $30,000 in 2009, from $3,000 in 2008, the suit alleges. Aetna paid the full $30,000 fee \"numerous\" times in 2009, says Michener. In-network doctors in the area receive $2,655 for the operation, according to Aetna. Abdelghani\\'s income from Aetna rose from $76,173 in 2007 to $5.1 million in 2010, the company says.Abdelghani\\'s attorney, Charles Gormally, disputes Aetna\\'s figures and says the insurer paid Abdelghani\\'s practice a total of $5.8 million over a three-year period. The practice billed Aetna nearly $13 million over the three years, with some procedures not reimbursed at all, he says.The bottom line: Aetna\\'s legal campaign against expensive out-of-network charges is just the latest attempt by insurers to restrain soaring health costs.'),\n",

       "  'Until last year, General Motors\\' (GM) China marketers advertised the Chevy Cruze sedan with spy thriller-themed spots featuring Wentworth Miller, star of the TV show Prison Break. After Fox (NWS) canceled the series, Shanghai GM decided it wanted a new ad approach, one with \"real life, real people,\" says Joan Ren, general director for Chevrolet marketing.So the company teamed up with Youku.com (YOKU), China\\'s most popular online video operator, to create a new campaign for the Web featuring young urban Chinese. So far Youku has shown 10 of the videos, most from 10 to 20 minutes long and made by a professional director, and they\\'ve gotten a combined 84 million views. Ren says she\\'s pleased with Youku\\'s production values and the authentic tone of the campaign. \"They don\\'t allow low quality,\" Ren says.That anyone now associates Youku with authenticity is a step in the right direction for Victor Koo, the site\\'s founder and chief executive. Youku launched in 2006 as a local version of YouTube (GOOG), which China\\'s censors have long banned, and quickly became a premier place to download pirated movies and TV shows. (One of the most popular: Prison Break.) Now Koo is focused on working with GM, Procter & Gamble (PG), and other advertisers to create professionally produced Webisodes such as Crest Pro-Health II (a P&G serial set in a dentist\\'s office that has attracted 33.5 million viewers) that target 20- to 30-year-olds turned off by programming offered by state-owned TV\\'s hokey variety shows and melodramas. Youku has also cut deals with U.S. networks and studios to show Inception, Grey\\'s Anatomy, and other content.Koo figures legitimate programming, along with repairing Youku\\'s reputation as a piracy haven, will attract advertisers and differentiate the company from China\\'s many other YouTube knockoffs. (Youku is No. 1, with 35 percent of the market in China for online video.)His next challenges: making a profit and appeasing Beijing censors. After raising $203 million from its December initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange (NYX), Youku has lost $87 million since 2008 on sales of $86 million, and it\\'s likely to lose $21 million on sales of $110 million this year, according to a Mar. 1 report by Goldman Sachs (GS) analysts. Not to worry, says Koo: \"We are on the path to profitability.\" Investors seem to buy that message. Youku\\'s stock price has nearly quadrupled since the IPO. The real question, says Eric Wen, an analyst in Hong Kong with Mirae Asset Securities, is not whether Youku can move out of the red, but how big it can get. Less than 4 percent of Chinese advertising goes to online video, Wen says, vs. a third for TV, so there\\'s plenty of room to grow. \"Breakeven is not a concern,\" he says. \"There\\'s a tremendous amount of profit down the road.\"As for Beijing, Youku needs to show China\\'s censors that it is free of material the Communist Party finds subversive. The company and rival sites \"are trying to outdo each other in the efficiency of their self-censoring mechanisms,\" says Duncan Clark, chairman of Beijing-based consultancy BDA China. With dissidents inspired by upheaval in the Arab world trying to use social networking sites to organize protests in China, authorities are particularly nervous, he says, but the smooth-talking Koo gives Youku an edge. The CEO is \"as comfortable talking with bureaucrats as with venture capitalists,\" says Clark. \"He is able to play both sides very well.\"The Chinese government is also starting to crack down on illegal downloading, says Jeanette K. Chan, a partner in Hong Kong with the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison. Operators, she says, won\\'t be able to survive \"unless they have good content—not pirated content.\"That means the competition for legit content is heating up. Tudou, China\\'s No. 2 site, announced on Mar. 3 a deal with Walt Disney (DIS) to show Desperate Housewives, Lost, Criminal Minds, and Cougar Town online, while smaller rival Ku6 Media last year formed a partnership with Warner Bros. (TWX) and Sony (SNE) to stream movies and TV shows. Koo says he\\'ll be making more deals with studios while also creating more exclusive content like the Web series for GM. \"We are going to keep investing in Youku originals,\" he says. The days of unauthorized downloads are numbered, he adds. \"You can\\'t build a business out of that,\" Koo explains. \"If you can\\'t monetize it, what\\'s the point?\"The bottom line: Youku faces tough competition and scrutiny from Beijing. Its original-content strategy is winning over investors.'),\n",

       "  'You\\'ve got one of the world\\'s great brands. What have you learned about it? What\\'s best about it?\\nThe best part of the brand is that it touches people\\'s hearts, enters people\\'s lives all over the world from a very early age. So whether you speak to a great-grandparent, a parent, or a child, Disney (DIS) has some part in their lives, has played some role. They remember when they first saw Snow White or when they took their daughter to see Little Mermaid or when they took their grandson to see Toy Story.Is this the best time to have content, now that there are so many places to distribute it?\\nIt\\'s always been a good time to have great content—always. But today media is a combination of content and technology. And today we\\'re seeing content meeting technology like never before. It\\'s turbocharged technology, and it\\'s developing not only very rapidly but in very compelling ways because not only can you use technology to make content better—to make the experience more compelling, pictures, brighter sound, better 3-D, you name it—but it\\'s enabling people to access media in so many more places and so many more ways. Mobile devices are obviously a great example of that, the tablet, the new iPad. It\\'s unlike what we saw a year ago, two years ago.The iPad and apps are transformative?\\nAbsolutely, yes. I remember when Steve [Jobs] first showed me the iPad. I was breathless. I couldn\\'t wait to send e-mails—and I did very quickly—to as many people at Disney as possible. \"Let\\'s get ready for this. This is a game changer. Let\\'s make an application for news, let\\'s make games, let\\'s make sure the books we publish are digitized and we can put them on an iPad in ways that take advantage of what that technology can do. Let\\'s move our TV product there, our movie product there.\" I think we\\'re just seeing the beginning of the beginning when it comes to this great technology.I want to talk about Jobs because when you took over as CEO, one of the questions was the relationship with Pixar. It wasn\\'t great, and you wanted to buy it. I don\\'t know how well you knew him at that time ...\\nVery little. He controlled Pixar, he owned about 50 percent of it. He announced publicly that a very successful and mutually beneficial relationship with Disney was ending. I was named CEO in March 2005 ... and I called him the morning after the decision was made but before it was announced. I said: \"We should talk.\" I was aware that there were strains. At the same time, I had become very interested in moving video onto new devices, namely the iPod. This was before there was a video iPod. And discussing it with Steve, he confessed that there was going to be one. At the same time we were kicking ideas around about Pixar, we were kicking around ideas about moving ABC and Disney content to what would be the first video iPod in late \\'05. And so our relationship started to blossom because I had shown an interest in his technology. Then it hit me that we really needed to fix Disney Animation. And I realized that the best way to do it was to buy Pixar. It didn\\'t really have a for-sale sign on it, but we started throwing up crazy ideas. And he thought it was a big idea too, but he had to get buy-in from the people at Pixar, John Lasseter, an animation genius, and Ed Catmull, the technology genius. He pretty much said, \"It\\'s up to them.\"So where does Disney go next? Where do you want to take it?\\nWe don\\'t have to necessarily get bigger in terms of more brands, more content. We just have to continue to get better about the content we create. And two things are occurring that are wind at our backs. It\\'s not easy wind to catch but it exists. One is this technological wave, which is very, very helpful and attractive and exciting. The second is what\\'s happening in the world. You look at the growth of the middle class in China and India, for instance. They know Disney, they love Disney. In India there are 750 million cell phones. That was a market that did not have the infrastructure to distribute media on a mass basis. Suddenly—when you think about the smartphone in the hands of hundreds of millions of people—there\\'s the infrastructure, meaning you can charge people money directly for it. That\\'s very exciting.How long do you want to do this job?\\nI love this job. I think, in many respects, Disney\\'s a national treasure. And also I love the feeling you get when you walk down \"Main Street\" in Paris or Tokyo or Anaheim or Orlando and you see families, the children, the grandparents, the excitement—that is just an amazing thing.

Twitter, Facebook, MasterCard (MA), the Washington Post Co. (WPO), the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the U.S. State Dept., and countless other organizations large and small have had to deal with cyber-assaults. More often than not, the security hole is plugged and, if the victims are lucky, the plague abates. Not this time. HBGary Federal is a spinoff of Hoglund\\'s HBGary Inc., a cyber-security firm that offers protection to corporations and governments from cyber-attack. Hoglund built his career on the business of hacker-proofing—getting hacked meant HBGary failed at the very thing it\\'s paid to get right.Hoglund called Google\\'s corporate technical support to shut down the account, but a representative told him that doing so would take time. It didn\\'t matter. Intruders were already helping themselves to tens of thousands of internal documents and e-mails, some of them personal exchanges between Hoglund and his wife, Penny Leavy, president of HBGary. Then the hackers—who turned out to be members of the anarchic cyber-guerrilla organization that calls itself Anonymous—triumphantly posted their electronic booty on an online file-sharing service for all the world to see.That\\'s when Hoglund\\'s real problems began, and the resulting controversy—involving a high-powered Washington (D.C.) law firm, the Justice Dept., and the whistle-blower site WikiLeaks—hasn\\'t just been entertaining geek theater but a rare look into the esoteric realm of cyber-security. It\\'s a world where only a select few understand the workings of the computers and networks we all use, where publicly antagonizing the wrong people can have disastrous consequences, and where some participants tend toward self-aggrandizement and flexible differentiations between right and wrong.The HBGary Federal documents—to Hoglund\\'s surprise, he says—revealed unethical and potentially criminal plans to build a digital-espionage-for-hire business. \"They really showed how bad things are getting,\" says Bruce Schneier, a renowned computer security expert. \"Blackmail, espionage, data theft. These are things that were proposed as reasonable things to do. And no one said, \\'Are you crazy?\\' \"The plans were conceived in part by HBGary Federal\\'s top executive, a former U.S. Navy cryptologist named Aaron Barr. Barr was working in conjunction with two other security companies. In a bit of cloak-and-dagger grandiosity, the firms dubbed their collaboration Team Themis, after a titan of Greek mythology who embodied natural law. (Forsaking Themis brings on Nemesis.) Team Themis proposed to electronically infiltrate grass-roots organizations opposed to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the powerful Washington lobbying organization. In a separate and even more legally dubious proposal intended for Bank of America (BAC), the group laid out a plan to infiltrate WikiLeaks and intimidate its supporters.Team Themis\\'s machinations were exposed before they got past the proposal stage. But the schemes the security firms came up with were Nixonian in scope and Keystone Kops-like in execution. In a 12-page PDF sent to Hunton & Williams, the Washington law firm representing the U.S. Chamber, Team Themis suggested creating dummy documents and online personae, and scouring social networks such as Facebook for intelligence on their prospective client\\'s most vocal critics. In the proposal for Bank of America, the security firms suggested hacking WikiLeaks itself to expose its sources.For Hoglund and his 30-person company, the fallout from the revelations continues to grow. Employees of HBGary and their families have been besieged with hostile phone calls and e-mails, including some death threats, and the company canceled its presentations at the annual RSA cyber-security conference in February. News sites that cover computer security have plumbed the document dump, turning HBGary and Barr into objects of ridicule. Barr resigned on Mar. 1 and declines to speak publicly about the ordeal.All of it makes Greg Hoglund furious. \"These individuals are not hacktivists, they are criminals,\" he tells Bloomberg Businessweek, referring to his Anonymous adversaries. \"If you let a gang of cyber-thugs hack into systems with impunity and get away with it, what kind of precedent does that set for cyber-security?\"Hoglund, 38, is widely respected in the computer security world for his expertise with \"rootkits,\" software that facilitates privileged access to a computer while evading detection. The HBGary chief executive officer never went to college and learned his trade on the fly, spending time with other hackers and writing his own security software. He co-founded HBGary in 2004, providing corporations with tools to detect, analyze, and combat sophisticated malware attacks from hostile foreign governments. (The firm\\'s name is derived from Hoglund and his two original partners, Shawn Bracken and Jon Gary.) Among the companies HBGary has worked with are Morgan Stanley (MS), Sony (SNE), and Walt Disney (DIS).Fifteen months ago, Hoglund decided to branch out into a new market and spun off HBGary Federal to perform classified work for the U.S. government. Employees of the subsidiary would have military experience and top security clearances. To run the operation, Hoglund tapped Barr, then an engineer in the Intelligence Systems Division of military contractor Northrop Grumman (NOC).\"Aaron has a very high IQ. He\\'s a very smart individual,\" says Hoglund. \"He also has an incredibly good reputation, or he did at the time.\"In the year after he was hired, Barr had little success building HBGary Federal\\'s business. The firm initially attempted to break into the \"incident response\" market, selling its spycraft to government agencies so they could shut down leaks and identify cyber-attackers. That field is competitive, and paying work sparse for startups. By October 2010, in the e-mails that later became public, Hoglund warned Barr that HBGary Federal was \"out of money and none of the work you had planned has come in.\" In his reply, Barr agreed.Barr did have one possible lifeline. On Oct. 19, Palantir Technologies, a Palo Alto (Calif.) cyber-security company whose terrorism analysis software is used by the Pentagon and the CIA, reached out to HBGary Federal and another security firm, Virginia-based Berico Technologies, with a tempting offer. Palantir said it had been approached by Hunton & Williams, a century-old firm with ties to the Republican Party and the defense industry. The firm needed investigative services on behalf of a high-profile, deep-pocketed client.Barr and representatives from the other companies discussed the project via e-mail and visited Hunton & Williams in November to meet with Richard Wyatt, co-head of the firm\\'s litigation group. A person who was at the meeting says Wyatt wore suspenders, smoked a cigar, and propped up his cowboy boots on his desk—a cartoonish vision of a D.C. power broker. But the security professionals were impressed when they learned the identity of the prospective client: the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which had just backed a wave of successful conservative candidates for Congress.The Chamber, it seemed, had a public-relations problem: Activist organizations such as U.S. ChamberWatch, Velvet Revolution, and Change to Win were accusing it of financial improprieties and using foreign donations for political purposes. The Chamber believed all these grass-roots organizations were working in concert with the surreptitious backing of major unions. According to the e-mails released by Anonymous, Hunton & Williams was already amassing reams of information, including union rosters, and needed expert help in digesting the data. The security firms\\' mission, should they choose to accept it: Infiltrate the activist groups and their leadership, compile dossiers, and help the law firm \"truly understand and eliminate emerging threats that could cause harm to their clients,\" according to a Team Themis document.The team\\'s members spent much of November working up their proposal. They highlighted how they would funnel their gleanings through Palantir Technologies\\' military-grade terrorist-tracking software. \"We need to blow these guys away with descriptions of our capabilities,\" wrote Matthew Steckman, an engineer at Palantir, in one of the e-mails in the published documents. \"Make them think that we are Bond, Q, and money penny [sic] all packaged up with a bow.\"Then there was the matter of price. Such private online espionage was hardly common practice, and there was no industry-standard pay scale. Team Themis landed on $2 million. For that sum, the client would get a \"daily intelligence summary,\" \"link diagrams,\" and \"target impact analysis,\" among other services. Hunton & Williams, on behalf of the Chamber, balked at the price, so the security companies agreed to do a pilot on spec. (The law firm has not commented on the matter.)Hunton & Williams clearly saw potential in Team Themis. On Dec. 2, in a message with the subject line \"Urgent: Opportunity,\" a partner at the firm asked the group to come up with a new plan, this time to combat WikiLeaks on behalf of a different prospective client—Bank of America, which believed WikiLeaks was about to publish a cache of its documents. (The Justice Dept., the e-mails suggested, had recommended that Bank of America hire Hunton & Williams.)Barr took the lead in crafting what would become an infamous 24-slide PowerPoint presentation that called for a cyber-campaign of disinformation against WikiLeaks. The document analyzes WikiLeaks\\' server infrastructure, talks about planting news stories about the exposure of its confidential informants, and proposes online attacks. Some of the language is comical, like a verbal version of an old Spy Vs. Spy cartoon from Mad magazine: \"Speed is crucial!\" blares one slide. \"The threat demands a comprehensive analysis capability now.\" A person familiar with the creation of the presentation said it was the result of late-night brainstorming, and that the security firms knew Bank of America would likely reject the most aggressive tactics.As with the Chamber of Commerce scheme, the WikiLeaks proposal never got a final hearing. While HBGary Federal and the other security firms awaited a formal go-ahead from Hunton & Williams and its clients, Barr decided to deploy his new research techniques on Anonymous.Anonymous has had a busy winter. The group, which appears to be less a formal organization than a loose coalition of tech-savvy radicals, attacked government websites in Egypt and Tunisia. It launched denial-of-service attacks on Amazon.com (AMZN), PayPal, MasterCard, and Visa (V) after those companies declined to do business with WikiLeaks. Barrett Brown, an unofficial spokesman for the group, says its goal is \"a perpetual revolution across the world that goes on until governments are basically overwhelmed and results in a freer system.\"Barr had come to believe that companies would have to defend themselves against this anarchic sensibility using the same tactics as the mischief makers. He also believed he had the skills and experience to join the battle. His principal weapon was a method he developed to associate the real identities found in social networks such as Facebook and LinkedIn with the anonymous profiles of hackers. So while Hunton & Williams weighed Team Themis\\'s proposals, and with the ultimate fate of HBGary Federal hanging in the balance, Barr figured the time was right to demonstrate how social networks could yield an intelligence bonanza.Barr began by hanging out in an online forum called Internet Relay Chat (IRC), using a fake identity. At the same time, on social networks, he \"friended\" people thought to be senior members of the Anonymous collective. Barr then compared the times that suspected hackers logged into IRC chat rooms anonymously and into their own identifiable social networking accounts.The exposed HBGary e-mails would later reveal that Barr\\'s own employees thought he was overreaching and that they feared retribution from the vengeful Anonymous. But Barr plunged ahead. He proposed a talk at the RSA conference in San Francisco titled \"Who Needs NSA when we have Social Media?\" Then he promoted the talk by suggesting he would expose the identities of the primary members of the group.On Feb. 4, a Friday, Barr bragged to the Financial Times about his upcoming talk and claimed he had obtained the identities of the group\\'s de facto leaders. Bad idea. As Stephen Colbert summed it up, lampooning the HBGary affair on his TV show, \"Anonymous is a hornet\\'s nest. And Barr said, \\'I\\'m gonna stick my penis in that thing.\\' \"When hackers taunt, they often use the term \"pwned\"—as in, \"I so pwned you, newbie.\" No one seems to agree where the word came from. Google it, and you\\'ll find claims that it\\'s a corruption of \"owned,\" or that it\\'s from a computer game, or maybe it\\'s just a shortened form of the chess term \"pawned.\" Whatever its origins, the term connotes humiliating domination by another person or group.That\\'s roughly what happened next to Barr, Hoglund, and HBGary. Responding to Barr\\'s public claims, the Anonymous hackers exploited a vulnerability in the software that ran HBGary Federal\\'s website, obtained an encrypted list of the company\\'s user names and passwords, and decoded them. Barr and some of his colleagues, Anonymous then discovered, had committed computer security\\'s biggest sin: They used the same password on multiple accounts. The hackers commandeered Barr\\'s Twitter and LinkedIn accounts, lacing both with obscenities. One of the passwords also opened the company\\'s corporate Google account. Jackpot. In less than 48 hours after Barr\\'s Financial Times interview appeared, the hackers had the keys to the kingdom.They immediately started downloading HBGary\\'s e-mails. All told, Anonymous got hold of 60,000-plus—about 4.7 gigabytes worth, including attachments—and quickly put them all online in conveniently searchable form. The material details online security holes at HBGary clients and prospects such as Sony, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Disney, ConocoPhillips (COP), and dozens of others. The e-mails showed that DuPont (DD) was breached in 2009 (by the same hackers who hit Google) and again in late 2010. DuPont employees on a business trip to China even found that their laptops had been implanted with spyware while the hardware was supposedly locked inside a hotel safe.In the ensuing days, Barr and Leavy, HBGary\\'s president, took to IRC channels to plead with Anonymous for mercy. None was forthcoming. Members of the group and their supporters gleefully defaced and posted photos of Barr, published personal details about his family, tweeted his Social Security number, and generally gloated about pwning a professional adversary. They said the \"ninja team\" that hacked HBGary included a 16-year-old girl named Kayla. (Rumors online suggest that \"Kayla\" is actually a 26-year-old man living in New Jersey. Who\\'s right? Not even Anonymous may know.) \"We have no choice but to defend ourselves and defend WikiLeaks by these means,\" says Brown, the unofficial Anonymous spokesman. \"This has just begun. We\\'re absolutely at war now.\"Meanwhile, the other members of Team Themis deny they wanted to push the operations as far as Barr did—despite the volumes of incriminating e-mails. Palantir Technologies CEO Alex Karp blames HBGary for conceiving the plot, decries any attempt to develop \"offensive cyber capabilities,\" and has placed on leave Steckman, the engineer who coordinated with Team Themis. Palantir also issued a public apology to Glenn Greenwald, a Salon.com journalist who was singled out in a Themis proposal as a WikiLeaks defender and thus a possible target. In a statement, Berico Technologies says it \"does not condone or support any effort that proactively targets American firms, organizations, or individuals.\" At the same time, it cut ties with HBGary.The U.S. Chamber of Commerce said in a press release that it\\'s \"incredulous that anyone would attempt to associate such activities with the Chamber,\" adding that it had not seen the incendiary proposals before they were made public. Morgan Stanley dropped HBGary as a security contractor. Barr never delivered his speech and when he tendered his resignation three weeks after the Anonymous attack, he said he was confident HBGary would be able to \"weather this storm.\"As for Hoglund, even his friends in the security industry wonder how long HBGary can survive amid the onslaught of negative publicity. But the CEO claims his company has undergone a rigorous security review and is back on track. He says the hackers \"made a hole-in-one from 200 yards away\" and that it will never happen again. \"They are nowhere near as sophisticated and scary and large as they would like people to think they are,\" he says.And while the lesson of the HBGary saga may be that it\\'s not always easy to tell the black hats from the white hats in the ambiguous game of computer security, Hoglund has no doubt which is which. \"It will get worse,\" he says. \"This whole event has only emboldened them. I hope this isn\\'t the way the Internet has to be. Right now it\\'s a domain of lawlessness. This is bigger than HBGary, than my company. Right now, the pendulum has swung way over to the bad guys\\' side.\"'),\n",

But that is precisely how Jordan Silbert, 34, got into the artisanal tonic-water trade.After graduating from Brown University in 1998, Silbert moved to Sonoma, Calif., where he worked on tech projects for the County of Sonoma Economic Development Board. He later managed the disney.com (DIS) account at an interactive marketing company. Then Sept. 11 happened, and he returned to New York City to work for the Downtown Alliance, which manages Lower Manhattan\\'s Business Improvement District.One night in 2003, Silbert was drinking a gin and tonic in his Brooklyn backyard when his teeth started feeling sticky. He saw that the tonic\\'s \"ingredients were identical to Sprite, with different natural and artificial flavors,\" he says. Curious, he discovered that today\\'s tonics lack a key ingredient used in the original libation: quinine from Peruvian cinchona trees. It was replaced with a synthetic during World War II. Silbert ordered the bark for $10 online and found a recipe to extract the quinine. He added homemade seltzer and agave instead of sugar. He started making the tonic at parties, and his friends loved it.Silbert started business school at Yale University in 2004 with plans to go into city development. He still tinkered with tonic, and a professor—an Honest Tea co-founder—encouraged him. Working on a business plan, Silbert realized he needed a bottling facility and found one in Worcester, Mass.

       "  'In Market Street, a game played on social networks like Facebook, wannabe entrepreneurs open digital storefronts and compete with friends to attract shoppers. Many players pay real money to stock their virtual shelves with in-demand or seasonal items, such as rose bouquets on Valentine\\'s Day. That doesn\\'t work for the hundreds of thousands of Market Street players outside the U.S., in countries that don\\'t celebrate Valentine\\'s Day and other American holidays.So Playdom, the company behind Market Street, hired Mentez, a startup based in Miami, to come up with a Valentine\\'s Day alternative for the Brazilian adaptation of the game, known as Paraíso das Compras. As a solution, Mentez programmed digital versions of iconic objects from the annual Carnaval festival, including feathered costumes, musical instruments, confetti, and noisemakers. They will be put up for sale in the Portuguese-language edition of the game, which is played on Orkut, Brazil\\'s most popular social network.Playdom and other digital game companies are looking for growth in foreign markets, and they are relying on Mentez and its competitors to be their local tour guides. The market for virtual goods will total $6.1 billion worldwide in 2011, estimates investment bank ThinkEquity. Over the next two years, overseas sales of virtual goods in social games will grow 64 percent, nearly as fast as the 75 percent growth expected in the U.S. Game makers will have to take advantage of foreign opportunities if they\\'re to live up to lofty expectations: Walt Disney (DIS) paid $563 million to acquire Playdom in 2010, and Electronic Arts (ERTS) spent as much as $400 million on rival Playfish. Zynga, the social games leader with 271 million users, has become one of Silicon Valley\\'s hottest startups and is valued at $10 billion after T. Rowe Price (TROW) and Fidelity Investments recently held talks to invest in the company.Internationalizing a game requires knowledge of country-specific traditions, architecture, holidays, and currencies—all crucial elements in games that are supposed to feel like simulations of the real world. \"To really localize a game, it goes beyond translation,\" says Juan Franco, chief executive officer of Mentez. The four-year-old company specializes in adaptations for South and Central America, and has offices in São Paolo, Mexico City, Bogotá, and Medellin, Colombia. Russian company 101XP helps U.S. game designers crack the Eastern European market and target users on the region\\'s biggest social networks, including Mail.ru. Hong Kong-based 6waves customizes social media games for Asian audiences.Among the most promising opportunities for global growth is in Central and South America, says Ryan Linton, senior director of business development for Zynga. Today only about 10 percent of Zynga players are in Latin America, and the region \"is an untapped giant for us,\" he says.Mentez employs more than 60 experts in virtual goods, including graphic designers, translators, and business-school graduates versed in the economies of Latin American countries. In addition to designing custom digital objects, as it did for Playdom\\'s Market Street, Mentez helps game makers keep tabs on what sells well overseas, provides customer service, and markets games. Overseas players buy up to five times the number of localized products as they do non-customized ones, says Franco. Mentez takes between 40 percent and 60 percent of the revenues generated from the virtual goods it develops, which usually sell for $1 to $10 apiece.In some cases, Mentez also facilitates the payments. In Central and South American countries, only about 40 percent of people have credit cards, according to a 2008 report from the Commerce Dept. Mentez sells cards pre-loaded with $2 to $20 in Internet cafes, convenience stores, and other retail locations across Latin America, so gamers without credit cards can buy digital goods, too. While Zynga does not rely on Mentez to design virtual goods for its games, it began using the retail network, dubbed Paymentez, in late February. \"Right now it\\'s really easy to make a transaction online in the U.S.,\" says Zynga\\'s Linton. \"They don\\'t have that luxury in many of the Latin American countries.\" Chinese game developer Five Minutes, whose Happy Farm game is one of China\\'s most popular and a competitor to Zynga\\'s FarmVille title, already uses Mentez to sell cards and reach players in Latin America.Mentez CEO Franco says that since social games are a new business in Latin America, \"there is an opportunity for companies like Zynga to be aggressive in that market.\" Brazil, in particular, \"is a huge opportunity,\" he says. \"It\\'s the hottest market in the world today\" for social games.The bottom line: With help from startups like Mentez, social game companies are trying to exploit growth opportunities abroad with localized experiences.'),\n",

The comeback will be no small feat for Ken, who sank into obscurity after Barbie dumped him in 2004, ending a relationship that had endured 43 years. The split, described then in a Mattel (MAT) press release as the \"breakup of the millennium,\" cast Ken further into Barbie\\'s 11½-inch shadow.The rejection came as no surprise to Ken fans. Over the decades they\\'d watched him become little more than an accessory, like one of Barbie\\'s sparkly tiaras. Mattel even referred to him as \"arm candy.\" Then in 2004, Ken disappeared altogether. \"He\\'s never been in the spotlight,\" says Jef Beck of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, founder of He\\'s a Doll!—a Ken collectors club—and the author of the forthcoming I ♥ Ken: My Life as the Ultimate Boyfriend.Much as Pulp Fiction did for John Travolta, Ken\\'s scene-stealing part in Toy Story 3 restored him to his previous status of pop culture icon. The Walt Disney-Pixar (DIS) film was 2010\\'s highest-grossing film worldwide, with $1.06 billion, and earned a Best Picture Oscar nomination. Mattel\\'s publicity machine has been in overdrive ever since. Ken, who turns 50 on Mar. 13, now has his own Facebook page and Twitter feed (sample tweet: \"Weekend Ken-fession: I may have knocked somebody over while walking and playing Madden on my iPhone this morning. My bad.\"). In January, Hulu.com began airing a Bachelor-style reality show called Genuine Ken: The Search for the Great American Boyfriend.Beaming with confidence after his big-screen debut, Ken won his ex back with professions of love on big-city billboards and ads in Us Weekly. One message: \"We may be plastic, but our love is real.\"His handlers also revamped his image, giving Ken a Justin Bieberesque makeover complete with floppy locks, skinny jeans, and graphic T-shirt. \"They softened his looks a little bit, but he\\'s still as handsome as ever,\" says Sandi Holder, a Barbie expert from Union City, Calif., who once auctioned one of the dolls for a Guinness World Record of $27,000.Ken\\'s comeback has been years in the making and came after a shakeup at the world\\'s largest toy brand—Barbie sells more than $1 billion a year—that began in 2008 when Richard Dickson took the reins of a business in decline. Amid competition from upstart brands such as MGA Entertainment\\'s Bratz dolls, the Barbie division had lost about a quarter of its revenue since 2002. \"Many people said, \\'Are you sure you want to get into that mess?\\'\" says Dickson, who had previously run Mattel\\'s consumer products unit.The new guardian of Toyland\\'s First Couple was less protective of the brand\\'s image than the previous regime. \"We gave people permission to play with our brand, to have fun,\" in the hope that it would become culturally relevant again, says the 42-year-old Dickson, who left Mattel a year ago to become brand president at The Jones Group (JNY). Under his watch, Mattel greenlighted the couple\\'s appearance in Toy Story 3. Mattel didn\\'t have script approval and let the filmmakers cast Ken, voiced by Michael Keaton, as a vain, leopard-print-wearing metrosexual. In one scene, Ken cries: \"I\\'m not a girl\\'s toy.\" Says Dickson: \"Poking at Ken\\'s cultural noise is part of the fun. If you are talking about it...then we are doing our job.\"The changes Dickson unleashed have boosted the brand\\'s sales, which rose 6.8 percent to $1.25 billion in 2010 and may increase 4 percent this year, according to UBS Securities analyst Robert Carroll. \"Barbie has gotten her groove back,\" he says. Sales of Ken dolls have rallied too, says Stephanie Cota, who succeeded Dickson as Barbie chief, though she won\\'t give specific figures. Despite Ken\\'s breakout movie role and his growing ranks of Twitter followers, his future depends, as always, on the woman he loves. Says Cota: He\\'ll stay in the spotlight \"unless he does something to really upset Barbie.\"The bottom line: Mattel has brokered a reconciliation between Ken and Barbie as part of its brand-marketing strategy.'),\n",

This oligopoly will maintain pricing at a time when the world needs to start spending a huge amount to produce grain more efficiently. Growth in emerging markets means we've got 500 million more people in the middle class now vs. one decade ago. They'll require more food. Mosaic's probably trading at 11 or 12 times estimated 2011 earnings—slightly less than its peers.As a maker of flash memory microchips, SanDisk (SNDK) is a play on smartphones and tablet PCs. What I like is that I don't have to try to pick the winner of the tablet PC or smartphone race. Maybe it will be Apple (AAPL), maybe it won't. But these devices all have flash memory in them. SanDisk trades at 13 to 14 times 2011 consensus earnings estimates of $3.81 per share. I think it will earn $6; by my estimate it trades at 8.5 times 2011 earnings. The company has almost never been this cheap.For 10 years the market has lauded companies such as Apple and Netflix (NFLX) that deliver media content in a stylish fashion while punishing people making the content. But nobody buys an iPod to listen to air. Content makers like Disney (DIS) will start pulling back access and raising fees, which will be hugely positive to bottom lines. Disney trades at 15 times fiscal 2011 earnings. I can see it trading at 25 times a $3 per share earnings number in 2012—around where it's traded historically.\"),\n",

       "  'California\\'s role as the incubator of talent that powers Silicon Valley and Hollywood owes much to a university system that has produced 56 Nobel Prize winners. Now, as Governor Jerry Brown tackles a crippling deficit, his plan to slash higher education spending by 16 percent is raising concerns that the state may be jeopardizing the future of its high-tech and entertainment industries—and by extension the country\\'s growth.From the University of California, Berkeley, ranked the nation\\'s top public university by U.S. News & World Report, to San Jose State University, which each year graduates more than 1,000 engineering students, the state\\'s 33 public institutions are the birthplaces of companies and the sources of upward mobility for 650,000 students. That talent pool may be limited if the university system can no longer guarantee admission to the top 12.5 percent academic performers of California\\'s high school seniors, and applicants are deterred as annual tuition for residents, less than $4,500 a decade ago, rises to at least $11,124 in the next school year. Mitch Kapor, founder and chief executive officer of Lotus Development, who invests in technology startups, says Brown\\'s proposed cuts could have a lasting effect on the vitality of a state that\\'s home to 14 percent of the companies in the Standard & Poor\\'s 500-stock index, including Google (GOOG), Apple (AAPL), and Walt Disney (DIS). \"Failing to continue to support the public higher ed system in California will have devastating long-term consequences,\" Kapor says.Trimming the state\\'s $25.4 billion deficit by cutting university budgets could make California\\'s fiscal situation worse by stifling job creation and reducing the tax base, says Robert R. Ackerman, managing director of Allegis Capital, a Palo Alto (Calif.) firm that invests in computer networking and software companies. \"It\\'s ass-backwards, it\\'s upside-down, it\\'s stupid,\" he says. \"We\\'re reducing the ability to create the next generation that is going to create the jobs that [are] going to pay the pension obligations that this state has.\"California, which aims to reduce its costs by $1.4 billion, isn\\'t alone. Florida lowered its general revenue spending for 28 public colleges and 11 universities by 14 percent over the past three years. Funding in 2010 for the State University of New York, a system of 64 colleges and universities, fell $355 million, to $8.09 billion, for the fiscal year ending in March. Those cuts will reverberate, says Jeffrey R. Immelt, chairman and CEO of General Electric (GE). \"We hire thousands of college grads in the U.S.,\" Immelt said at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas on Jan. 7. \"That, for us, is our lifeblood.\"The spending cuts also pose a threat to America\\'s ability to compete in the global economy. China has identified seven universities that it will fund at a higher rate and aims to elevate Peking University and Tsinghua University into the top 20 in the world, according to a 2010 article in Foreign Affairs magazine by Yale University President Richard C. Levin.To educate its growing population, India needs 600 more universities and 35,000 additional colleges, Human Resources Minister Kapil Sibal said in November. The country is seeking foreign universities to partner with Indian institutions and has attracted interest from Duke University, Boston University, and Georgia Institute of Technology. \"Right now, if I were the Chinese university system, I\\'d be running ads showing up on UC\\'s websites, recruiting students to universities in Beijing and Shanghai,\" Ackerman says.The bottom line: Plans by California to reduce higher education spending by $1.4 billion could backfire long term by cutting job growth and tax revenue.'),\n",

       "  '2011-01-20',\n",
       "  'In a hangarlike Las Vegas exhibition hall on Jan. 6, Jeffrey L. Bewkes is surrounded by flashing screens, by women in campy space-age outfits, and by aisle after aisle of gadgetry: the great American come-on known as the Consumer Electronics Show. It\\'s been seven years since Bewkes, the chief executive officer of Time Warner (TWX), last attended CES, and he looks a little out of place. A few minutes earlier, Verizon Communications (VZ) CEO Ivan G. Seidenberg brought him onstage as a surprise guest during Seidenberg\\'s keynote, but the tech fanboys in the crowd weren\\'t interested in hearing about Time Warner\\'s vast catalog of movies and TV shows moving onto the Web. They showed more emotion for the demonstration of Google\\'s (GOOG) new \"Honeycomb\" tablet operating system than they did for Bewkes\\' video featuring Time Warner stars watching their own TV spots on an array of devices.Now, moving through a sea of geeks after his presentation, Bewkes resembles a Time Warner character himself—one of those well-dressed, humorless robot agents from The Matrix, surrounded by younger, hipper renegades. He strides through the hall, barely glancing at a wall of 3D video screens, and says why he isn\\'t worried about wowing the techies. \"I\\'m here to explain things to the attendees,\" he says, \"because the attendees tend to not understand the media business.\" At a trade show that celebrates the wonders of low-cost digital distribution, he\\'s an emissary from the land of paid content. His message is simple and sharp: The devices may be cool, but anything that costs money to produce must be paid for, and any service or channel that doesn\\'t carry its weight is destined to die.For Bewkes, 58, the solution is a Time Warner initiative called TV Everywhere, which essentially forces customers to keep paying their $75-plus monthly cable bill to access television and movie content on any Web-enabled device they choose. He first floated the idea to Comcast (CMCSA) CEO Brian L. Roberts two years ago, and in late December, Time Warner struck a multiyear deal with the cable operator that will allow subscribers to watch all the content from its basic cable channels—including TNT, TBS, CNN, and Cartoon Network—via Comcast\\'s Xfinity service. Digital access for HBO and Cinemax customers will be available in 70 million homes by the second quarter, he says. Verizon FiOS, AT&T (T), DirecTV (DTV), Dish Network (DISH), and Time Warner Cable (TWC) are also expected to roll out versions of the TV Everywhere concept in coming months. Bewkes wants other media companies to offer the same all-or-nothing Web menu, arguing the only way to win the digital war is to \"keep it simple, stupid.\"Then again, rival approaches to distribution—from the à la carte menu championed by Apple\\'s (AAPL) iTunes store to the cheap monthly subscription model of Netflix—are pretty simple, too. With the health problems of Apple CEO Steve Jobs compelling him to step down for a third leave of absence, his influence must be measured not just across the computer, phone, and device businesses but across the media distribution business as well. In part it can be measured by the model Bewkes is fighting against: Call it the Apple Trap. Consumers enjoy watching shows for free online or going to the iTunes store and renting them for as little as 99 cents a pop, about 70 cents of which makes it back to the content creator. Since that is far less than what other distributors pay, Bewkes is no fan of it. He won\\'t play the 99 cents rental game for first-run fare, but he is willing to sell episodes, charging a premium for HBO content. \"I\\'ve talked to Steve Jobs quite a bit,\" he says. \"I tell him if he wants to sell our content, he has to pay a fair price for it.\"Bewkes\\' price doesn\\'t start at a buck. The man who built his career over 23 years at HBO will not make his hit movies or shows available for cut-rate streaming at Amazon (AMZN). Nor will he offer them for instant viewing at Netflix (NFLX), where CEO Reed Hastings recently rolled out a $7.99-a-month deal for unlimited streaming of TV shows and movies. And Bewkes certainly won\\'t let his product be given away on Hulu, which distributes most of its advertising-supported programming for free. Netflix has wooed more than 16 million subscribers, usually paying a fraction of what cable and satellite owners pay TV channels to run content. And while about 70 percent of the ad dollars Hulu takes in gets back to the content owner, those online ads don\\'t draw anywhere near the audience or revenues of TV. That\\'s why Amazon, Netflix, Hulu, and iTunes are potential enemies to Bewkes. He holds the view that companies such as Time Warner can only continue to make high-quality content if they preserve a business model that requires consumers to pay for the whole buffet. Any Web distributor can stream his content, says Bewkes, \"if they pay us a billion dollars for a marquee show.\"If the situation is so black and white, however, why have Bewkes\\' rivals been willing to test new distribution models? News Corp. (NWS), Viacom (VIA), and NBC Universal, among others, have experimented with different ways to do business on the Web. Walt Disney (DIS) has been the boldest, perhaps because board member Steve Jobs is its largest shareholder. Disney has the broadest range of offerings on iTunes and last year struck a deal to rent ABC shows for 99 cents each. News Corp.\\'s Fox network is in a six-month trial to rent hits like Glee at the same price. Both networks are partners with NBC Universal in Hulu, which launched in early 2007 as a way for TV networks to combat the piracy that gutted the music business. \"When I took this job four years ago, the words Hulu, Netflix, Google TV, and iTunes were not part of the lexicon,\" says Jeff Zucker, the departing boss of NBC Universal, now merging with Comcast. \"And now, frankly, it\\'s all we think about.\"These days on the digital battlefield, it\\'s hard to tell who\\'s a friend and who\\'s a foe. There\\'s the advancing army of Boxee, Roku, Slingbox, and other new services that make it easier to find and stream content. Google and Cisco Systems (CSCO) are getting into the game of connecting the Internet to the home TV; so is Microsoft (MSFT) with its Xbox console. Bewkes views all of them as potential allies in helping people find his shows—but not if they dare to sell their own ads around them. Verizon\\'s Seidenberg argues that Bewkes\\' obstreperousness makes him an innovator. \"If we do this right,\" he says, \"we can work with all the content companies to create a responsible transition to new platforms.\"It\\'s understandable that media moguls such as Bewkes don\\'t want to disrupt relationships with TV distributors that have been lucrative for so long. But Boxee CEO Avner Ronen, whose company makes software that lets customers watch Net content on their TVs, predicts the world will move to a model where consumers will pay one price to get a distribution service and another for the content they actually want. Companies such as Time Warner \"need to take all their amazing content and be aggressive in engaging with the new technologies. Of course they should be paid. They have to cover the costs to make it.\" Adds Michael Pachter of Wedbush Securities: \"The guys who will ultimately profit the most in the new environment are the ones who own the content.\"So far, however, assembling the technologies and players needed to implement TV Everywhere has been a challenge. Rival studios enjoy the extra income and reach that Apple or Netflix distribution can bring. Distributors would love to lower the fees they must pay to carry a range of channels, many of which their customers don\\'t really want. Fox Filmed Entertainment co-Chairman Jim Gianopulos says rolling it out isn\\'t so easy. One concern is how to give a subscriber online access without letting the entire dorm use that account to stream episodes of True Blood onto everyone\\'s laptop. \"Any time you try to arrive at a standardized set of rules or content-protection standards across an industry,\" Gianopulos says, \"there\\'s cacophony before there\\'s order.\"If the noise bothers Bewkes, he doesn\\'t show it. At CES he\\'s almost buoyant. When a TV reporter describes Netflix as an 800-pound gorilla, he says it\\'s more like a \"200-pound chimp.\" When he runs into DirecTV CEO Mike White, he gives a thumbs-up and declares that \"satellite is good!\" He notes with satisfaction recent increases in TV viewership and ad rates, along with an explosion of high-quality programs he calls \"a new golden age of television.\" He can also point to his company\\'s results as a sign of survival. Bewkes lost about 1.5 million subscribers at his Cinemax and HBO channels last year but says most were on free promotions. Despite a tough economy, close to 40 million households still pay about $13 extra each month for the premium services. With Time Warner expected to report on Feb. 2 that 2010 earnings grew 3 percent while revenues rose 2.9 percent, to $26.5 billion, Bewkes can claim that his content remains king—at least for now.Content is all he has left. In his three years as CEO of Time Warner, Bewkes has whittled down his company, spinning off Time Warner Cable and AOL (AOL), closing 34 magazines, and folding New Line Cinema into Warner Bros. What remains is about 43 percent smaller in revenues and focused squarely on content in the form of HBO, Warner Bros., the Time Inc. stable of magazines, and Turner Broadcasting\\'s cable channels. Almost three-quarters of Bewkes\\' operating profits in 2009 came from the cable networks, with subscription fees making up 64 percent of that unit\\'s revenues and ad sales supplying the rest.Bewkes believes the TV Everywhere model can revive his sluggish magazine business. He wants print subscribers to get the same content on the Web without being forced to pay twice. Time Inc. struck a deal with iTunes to adopt that model for People, but Apple won\\'t allow it for any of its other titles. That creates yet another source of tension with Apple, which prefers to sell separate digital editions on iTunes and take its usual 30 percent cut. (Apple declined comment.) Also troubling, for Time Inc. CEO Jack Griffin, is Apple\\'s control of the process. \"You never want to let another party get between you and your customer,\" he says. \"Everyone should be able get what they paid for on whatever device they want.\"Hulu, in Bewkes\\' view, undermines the value of current programs on TV. \"Are you testing the proposition that if you give people their favorite shows without commercials, they\\'ll like it? I can tell you: Yes. Yes, they will.\" (Hulu does in fact show commercials.) NBCU\\'s Zucker, a Hulu founder, says his philosophy was to experiment \"but not bet the entire ranch on any one form of digital distribution.\" And there\\'s always divorce. Viacom chief Philippe Dauman pulled Comedy Central\\'s The Daily Show and The Colbert Report from the site last March. \"We said, \\'Great service, but the economics aren\\'t quite there yet; come back to us when you have a different model.\\' \"Bewkes saves his real venom for Netflix. Speculating about its dominance, he told The New York Times, \"is a little bit like, is the Albanian army going to take over the world?\" Yet it poses the greatest threat to HBO. By letting customers stream unlimited movies or shows for a small fee, it could make the pay channel obsolete. Bewkes says it\\'s feeding off the ignorance of content owners who are risking their core businesses in exchange for modest fees. Hastings declined to comment, but Netflix spokesman Steve Swasey noted that \"Netflix adds new money to content owners whereas other ventures do not.\" He points out that the service carries some Time Warner content, such as the Warner Bros. series Nip/Tuck. Studio chief Barry M. Meyer says he\\'s happy to offload niche shows that can\\'t be sold elsewhere but not his hits.Bewkes says a growing number of content companies are waking up to the perils of the new low-cost Web channels. \"For a year, they had some young digital-rights VP selling this stuff for an extra 10 percent, and people said, \\'You should give little Freddy a bonus because he made some extra money,\\' \" he says. \"Meanwhile, someone realizes he just sold TNT a series for $2 million an episode that can be shown two times a week, and Freddy sold the same rights for $200,000 to a website that can run it day and night.\" There go your syndication deals and DVD sales, he says. Turner Broadcasting System CEO Philip Kent, for one, let USA Network outbid him for the right to syndicate the hit Modern Family because he felt it had been overexposed online. To stoke audience appetite, HBO chief Bill Nelson says, \"We wait a year or more after airing a show to issue it on DVD.\"Netflix stock rose almost 220 percent last year, while Time Warner shares underperformed the market, rising a little more than 10 percent. As Bewkes sees it, a great website and low-paying subscribers don\\'t add up to a healthy business. \"We\\'ve all seen this movie before,\" he says. \"It was called AOL.\"It\\'s a telling quote—as Bewkes intends it to be. After all, he sealed his reputation as a tough executive by standing up to the leaders of AOL after the Web company merged with Time Warner in what became known as the worst corporate marriage in American history. Announced in January 2000, the merger valued AOL Time Warner at $350 billion, the bulk of which came from AOL\\'s market cap. Within two years the deal that had been hailed as an Internet rescue of old media had failed, losing two-thirds of the original valuation. Bewkes was still running HBO when he showed his mettle in a 2002 meeting recounted in Alec Klein\\'s book Stealing Time. Steve Case, the AOL co-founder who was then AOL Time Warner chairman, was extolling the importance of corporate synergies when Bewkes interrupted. \"This is bullshit,\" Bewkes said. \"The only division that\\'s not performing is yours.\"That Bewkes would turn out to be so tough was not a given. The second of three boys, he grew up in a family of achievers that moved around commuter towns in New Jersey and Illinois before settling in the moneyed seaside community of Darien, Conn. His grandfather had been president of St. Lawrence University, a private liberal arts college in upstate New York, and his father was a top executive at conglomerate Norton Simon before becoming chairman and CEO of American Bakeries. The family\\'s wealth was understated, a friend says, and the dinner table was a place for good manners and intellectual debate. The Bewkes boys were steered toward pursuits such as skiing and windsurfing, according to James Angell, an artist who roomed with Bewkes at Yale University. Team sports were shunned. \"His family considered the level of intelligence inversely proportional to the number of people on the field,\" says Angell. While \"you wouldn\\'t call them touchy-feely,\" he adds, \"they were quite funny.\"Bewkes\\' path to success was well mapped. He spent his high school years at Deerfield Academy, a prep school founded in 1797, then moved on to Yale, studying a little bit of this and that—\"pursuing my interests without regard to a careerist pigeonhole,\" as he told the dean who insisted he declare a major. (He picked philosophy because that\\'s where he had the most credits. Later he earned a Stanford MBA.) Christopher Isham, a fellow Yalie who\\'s now the Washington bureau chief for CBS News, describes their group of friends as having \"a certain strain of irreverence.\"It\\'s a strain he still displays today. Bewkes will happily riff on the finer points of paint color and stonework in ancient Rome for several minutes before settling back in his chair and adding, \"We\\'re very busy here at Time Warner.\" David Chase, who created The Sopranos, recalls one Bewkes speech in which he talked about trying to learn Yiddish at the age of eight so he could break into show business. PepsiCo (PEP) CEO Indra K. Nooyi, who serves with Bewkes on the Yale board, says he often has the other board members \"rolling in laughter\" at meetings. \"He doesn\\'t operate from a place of fear,\" says Chase. As head of HBO, he says, Bewkes gave the go-ahead for The Sopranos even though its pilot didn\\'t test well. He showed the same confidence in questioning the wisdom of AOL Time Warner when the dot-com people were still in charge and few inside the company would risk their careers by speaking up. \"Jeff was clearly echoing the sentiments of everybody on the Time Warner side,\" says Richard D. Parsons, who was then the CEO. \"He was never intimidated by the AOLers.\"When Bewkes took over from Parsons in early 2008, he immediately began to break apart the company. First he spun off its 84 percent-controlled cable operation, which gave Time Warner $9.25 billion of extra cash when the deal closed a year later. While the cable business wasn\\'t broken—its stock has outperformed its former parent—Bewkes didn\\'t want a $17.2 billion-a-year distribution business with high capital costs. Glenn A. Britt, a long-time colleague of Bewkes\\' who\\'s now CEO of Time Warner Cable, says the executive team agreed the businesses were better off apart. \"I was always more into cable and technology,\" he says, \"whereas Jeff was more into content.\" As for the confusion created by now having two companies with the same name, Britt points out that \"we were the only part of Time Warner that used the name to do business.\" Since taking in the cash payout from Time Warner Cable, Bewkes has spent roughly $1.6 billion on dividends and $2.7 billion on stock buybacks—a conservative play, for sure. The company had $4 billion in cash on hand in September, its most recent filing.Next, Bewkes turned his attention to the dysfunctional AOL. Its core business—selling dial-up Internet access to 26.7 million subscribers at its height—had gone the way of the buggy whip. In March 2008, Bewkes made his biggest strategic gaffe, spending $850 million to buy a social network site called Bebo. A year later he brought in Google ad executive Tim Armstrong to run AOL, and Armstrong eventually sold Bebo at a fraction of its original cost. (\"You can call that one a failure,\" Bewkes says.) Armstrong had plans to turn AOL into a content company, but Bewkes cut it loose in December 2009, giving Time Warner investors one AOL share for every 11 TWX shares they owned in a deal that valued the denuded Web player at $2.5 billion.That sale is essentially what activist shareholder Carl Icahn was pushing Parsons to do in 2005. \"I wish it had happened earlier,\" says Icahn, who also suggested spinning off Time Inc. \"Jeff has done a real good job.\" Fund manager David Giroux, who holds 10.4 million Time Warner shares though the T. Rowe Price Capital Appreciation Fund (PRWCX), is more impressed with what Bewkes is doing now. Giroux describes him as \"the first person to realize that giving away your content for free is not a good business model.\" Bewkes\\' preference for buybacks (and the richest dividend in the media business) over acquisition pleases Giroux, too. That said, Bewkes confirms that he\\'s looking into buying assets from Dogan Yayin Holding, Turkey\\'s largest media group, if the price and political climate are right.Taken together, the company calculates that return to shareholders from the three former parts of the empire rose about 13 percent during Bewkes\\' first three years on the job. Returns from Time Warner alone were up only 1.9 percent, according to Bloomberg data. That places Time Warner between the performance of Disney (up 21 percent) over the same period and rivals such as CBS and News Corp. (down 21 percent and 26 percent, respectively). Lead director Frank J. Caufield says he\\'s pleased. \"The entire board thinks Jeff has done an extraordinary job,\" says Caufield. \"He has a consistent vision, and he\\'s aggressively pursuing it.\"Because Bewkes is known as a practical, shareholder-focused manager, some describe him as cautious and conservative—a \"numbers guy\" and even a \"sensible technocrat,\" in the words of a New York magazine profile. (Bewkes calls the label \"better than some of the alternatives.\") Don Logan, a former Time Inc. chief who shared operational duties with Bewkes when Parsons made both group chairmen in 2002, praises him as an analytical boss who \"doesn\\'t put a lot of layers between himself and the people in the field.\" When he took over the top jobs at HBO and later Time Warner, Bewkes didn\\'t replace himself as COO.That Bewkes is rarely described as a visionary is a relief to Turner\\'s Phil Kent, who had enough of the vision thing and left CNN shortly after the merger, then returned in 2003 when the AOL side of the company was on the wane. \"The business has evolved to a place where you need really smart, clear-thinking leaders who put shareholders first.\"Given the flux in the media business right now, matched against the sizzle and speed of Silicon Valley, some might wonder whether a leader who stands for stable evolution may be more hindrance than help. After listening to Bewkes speak at the UBS Global Media and Communications Conference in New York last month, one media executive, who asked not to be named because of close ties to the company, admitted to feeling a little empty. What Bewkes said sounded sensible, the executive says, but he didn\\'t offer any compelling reasons to buy the stock.Bewkes likes to remind people that Time Warner\\'s businesses are typically top in class, though nobody is about to brag about CNN\\'s recent prime-time performance. There\\'s the leading pay channel, the powerhouse production studio, the cable channels, and the magazine unit with still-profitable titles from Sports Illustrated to Time to People. Skeptics point out that he could have trotted out the same list of leading properties two decades ago. What\\'s new at this company?What\\'s new, Bewkes says, is defending what\\'s old. In a world where Time Warner content is everywhere, the company is still getting paid for it. If he succeeds in keeping that world alive, Bewkes will be justly hailed, if not for his vision, then for his intransigence. Back at the electronics show in Las Vegas, Bewkes is ever vigilant. At the Samsung booth, he spots Britt, chief of the spun-off Time Warner Cable, and motions to a reporter. \"Come here,\" Bewkes says. \"We liberated this guy.\" As Britt shows off some new Samsung technology that gives subscribers a snappy interface and no need for a set-top box, Bewkes has just one question: Will anyone be able to shrink that screen and sell ads around Time Warner\\'s content? An exasperated Britt shakes his head.Bewkes has to go, but he wants to show that he cares about the football fields of new tablets, smartphones, and other gadgets on which his content increasingly appears. So he turns to a colleague at the Samsung booth, Warner Bros. chief Barry Meyer, and says, \"Barry, don\\'t leave without seeing all the other stuff.\" Meyer nods in mock deference, promising to inspect no fewer than 13 other devices, all with different-sized screens.Until Bewkes is comfortable that each of those screens will more than cover his costs, he might be right to hold the line on digital distribution. It isn\\'t brash, but it may be effective. \"In times of crisis, Americans tend to default to action,\" says analyst Laura Martin of Needham. \"Maybe Jeff, in taking no action until it makes sense, is being more innovative than you\\'d think.\"'),\n",
       " ('Apple, With or Without Steve Jobs',\n",
       "  '2011-01-19',\n",
       "  'IPods, iPads, and iPhones would have baffled the German social scientist Max Weber, who died in 1920. The father of modern sociology, however, would surely have understood something about the man behind those futuristic gadgets. Weber defined the \"charismatic leader\" as one whose influence stems from almost preternatural insights and imagination, and who inspires devotional loyalty from his followers—which adds up to an uncanny description of Steve Jobs.Weber also argued that organizations structured around a charismatic leader are doomed to lose their vigor after the great one leaves the scene. That prediction became relevant on Jan. 17, when Jobs, perhaps the most charismatic chief executive officer in business history, announced yet another medical leave from Apple (AAPL), the company he has led to breathtaking heights. In a letter to his 50,000 employees, Jobs handed off daily control of the company to Apple\\'s chief operating officer, Timothy D. Cook. He didn\\'t say when he would return or why he was leaving, but the undertones were ominous. He referred to his management team\\'s plans for 2011 and sounded an unusual emotional note: \"I love Apple so much and hope to be back as soon as I can.\"The announcement triggered speculation about Jobs\\' health—and minor indigestion among shareholders. It also posed yet again the unavoidable question that now looms over 35-year-old Apple: What happens to a modern company whose innovations and inspirations are so closely tied to the vision of one leader when that leader\\'s influence is in decline? The only thing certain is that the Apple of the future—whether in a year or a decade—will look a lot different from the reliable engine of innovation and profits that investors and customers know so well.Jobs\\' health has been an issue for so long that many investors have grown inured to it. In 2004 doctors diagnosed Apple\\'s co-founder with a neuro endocrine tumor, a rare form of pancreatic cancer. He took an undisclosed leave of absence for treatment and a six-month leave in 2009, when he underwent a liver transplant at the Methodist University Hospital Transplant Institute in Memphis.Apple spokesperson Katie Cotton declined to comment further on Jobs\\' condition. According to a person with direct knowledge of his health, who requested anonymity because the matter is private, the Apple founder has had trouble gaining weight, and immunosuppressant medications related to the transplant have made him susceptible to colds and the flu.Jobs\\' health problems have not interrupted Apple\\'s historic run of successes. Apple devices and online services such as iTunes have, one by one, disrupted the music, mobile phone, media, and video-game industries. Even the Macintosh is on a tear. It now commands 9.7 percent of the personal computer market in the U.S., up from less than 3 percent a decade ago. Along the way, Apple has become the second most highly valued company in the world, behind only ExxonMobil (XOM) and well ahead of tech nemesis Microsoft (MSFT). On Jan. 19, Apple announced its latest results: $6 billion in profits during the last three months of 2010, a record that surpassed the previous high by 40 percent.With all that momentum, Apple can thrive for years, even without Jobs\\' daily presence. The company\\'s lineup for 2011 is set. It includes the iPhone for Verizon (VZ) and, in all likelihood, new versions of the iPhone and iPad as well as fresh takes on old hits like the iPod and iMac.Plans are no doubt taking shape for 2012 and beyond. Jobs recently revealed that the company was working on the iPad even before the debut of the iPhone in 2007. Similarly, the Apple skunkworks has probably cooked up new versions of the iPhone and iPad for next-generation 4G mobile networks. Some analysts even believe Apple could be preparing its own high-definition television, with Apple TV software built in, as an alternative to the lightly selling $99 Apple TV set-top box. \"They know what products they are launching at least two years, and maybe even three or more, into the future,\" says Barclays Capital (BCS) analyst Ben Reitzes. \"They are on autopilot to a degree, at least in terms of the big picture.\"Although the product plan may be mapped, Apple without Steve Jobs will be a less interesting company. Jobs, according to the portrait laid out in countless biographies and articles over the years, is a control freak with a compulsive attention to detail. He routinely sends products back to the lab, kills them in their crib, demands new features, or euthanizes old ones, all while keeping Apple\\'s attention narrowly focused on just a few products with potential for high returns. \"We\\'re always thinking about new markets we could enter,\" Jobs told BusinessWeek in 2004. \"But it\\'s only by saying no, so that you can concentrate on the things that are really important.\" Jobs\\' obsession with process and detail even filters down to how he rolls out products. Besides exhaustively rehearsing his own presentations, he often insists that executives from partner companies submit to a week or more of dry runs—and has been known to bounce execs at the last minute if they show signs of nerves that could mar a Jobs keynote.Jobs commands Apple with the discipline and improvisational confidence of John Coltrane. It\\'s not clear who else, if anyone, at the company can groove with equal flair. Executive grooming, like much else at Apple, is handled in an unorthodox way. Most corporations aim to enhance the leadership abilities of their employees. Some, such as General Electric (GE), are veritable factories for seasoned executives. At Apple, rather than recruiting or developing the most promising and versatile general managers, Jobs concentrates on hiring the best person in a given discipline.The result is a team of highly skilled specialists who operate in a system that still resembles a startup. There are no separate lines of business and no business unit chiefs with responsibility for their own balance sheets. Important decisions are usually made at weekly Monday strategy sessions with Jobs overseeing his 10-member executive team. New executive hires—such as former IBMer Mark Papermaster, who joined as a senior vice-president in 2008 and left for Cisco Systems (CSCO) last year—typically don\\'t last long.Who will steer the ship when, inevitably, Jobs is gone? Most analysts are unreservedly enthusiastic about the talents of Tim Cook, who is widely viewed as Apple\\'s next chief executive if and when Jobs permanently steps aside. Cook, 50, is an operations genius, adept at cutting costs while delivering complex products on time and coping with staggering growth targets. He\\'s also monastic and incredibly devoted to Apple. He has oversight of sales, customer support, and logistics—meaning much of the company already reports to him. During Jobs\\' previous two absences, Cook steadied the corporate ship so capably that in 2010 he was rewarded with $59 million in salary and stock. Still, during those past medical leaves and now this new one, Jobs has remained involved in all major strategic decisions, Apple says. In that respect, Tim Cook is untested as a potential CEO.The rest of Jobs\\' team is studded with star role players but not accomplished generalists. Jonathan Ive, Apple\\'s design chief, joined the company during its churning descent in 1992 and is now easily the most famous industrial designer in the world. But he lacks overall business expertise and credibility with Wall Street. Marketing chief Philip W. Schiller is a burly, jovial Massachusetts native and a committed hockey fan. He\\'s known as loyal and effective but isn\\'t considered a tech visionary. Scott Forstall, Apple\\'s software chief, carved out a high profile in Silicon Valley by creating a platform for the iPhone that made it easy for developers to create applications. But the longtime Jobs ally has little experience minting new hardware. Ron Johnson, the head of retail operations, has helped turn Apple into one of the world\\'s most profitable chains—and somehow manages to coach youth baseball at the same time—but he is a retailer, not a technologist.Some outsiders fear that Jobs alone can stir this mix of talent. Take him out of the picture and the water goes calm, says a manager who does business with Apple, who did not want to be quoted by name because it would hurt his business relationship with the company. During Jobs\\' last absence, this person says, the creative tension disappeared, replaced by a play-it-safe ethos. The unavoidable fact is that lots of people can manage the company. Only Steve Jobs could have had the visionary spirit—and risk tolerance—to turn Apple into a mobile phone company.In the short term, however, the current team might actually outperform in the absence of its mercurial and stubborn mentor. Without Jobs\\' obstinacy at the negotiating table and unrelenting dedication to simplicity, it\\'s possible Apple could have avoided its rare mistakes, such as waiting too long to move the iPhone to Verizon (which gave momentum to phones powered by Google\\'s (GOOG) Android operating system) and blocking Adobe\\'s (ADBE) popular Flash video format on the iPad. An Apple without Jobs might one day even allow the iTunes media store to appear on devices such as HDTVs made by the likes of Sony (SNE) and Samsung. Or perhaps Apple could introduce a stripped-down version of the iPhone to compete with lower-cost handsets. These moves would likely horrify Jobs; he would see them as muddying the user experience and diluting the Apple brand. Yet they also make some business sense.Business history is replete with visionary founders whose companies survived and even thrived after they stepped away. Ford Motor (F) reached its zenith in the 1950s, a decade after the death of Henry Ford. Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) continued to grow after its namesake founders retired. Disney (DIS) foundered after Walt Disney died in 1966 but was revived two decades later under Michael Eisner.Those founders were 20th century inventors who didn\\'t think much about implanting perceptions of entire lifestyles in the consumer mind. Twenty-first century leaders such as Jobs are holistic innovators of both product and brand, says Warren Bennis, a professor of business administration at the University of Southern California\\'s Marshall School of Business. \"There is a different kind of innovation today that has to do with crafting the overall experience,\" he says.Jobs may be the best example of a new breed of business leader who can intuit customer emotions. Another is Howard Schultz, the longtime CEO of Starbucks (SBUX), who is selling not just high-priced coffee but also the idea of a \"third place\" between home and work. Such leaders are not easily replaced. When Schultz retired from Starbucks in 2000, the company went into a steep decline, and he was compelled to return in 2008.There is also evidence that operations-minded co-pilots fare poorly when they take over the control of companies in rapidly moving industries. Iconic founders such as Michael Dell and Charles Schwab stepped aside at their companies to make way for their operating partners—their Tim Cooks, if you will—and then were forced to return when the successors ran into trouble. \"The period after the charismatic leader is gone is always perilous, but in hypercompetitive, fast-moving industries, the loss becomes apparent much more rapidly,\" says Jay A. Conger, a professor of leadership studies at Claremont McKenna College.Even without Jobs at the helm, Apple could still deliver satisfying returns for shareholders. It can continue to press its gains in PC and mobile market share around the world, and it could build a sizable business selling to corporations. In that respect, Apple without Jobs could come to resemble a successful, if less sexy, company such as IBM (IBM), moving from a business of generating reliable \"hardware hits\" to one focused on recurring revenues from online ads, cloud services, and long-term contracts with companies.All this is speculative, of course, given the uncertainties about Jobs\\' health. But there is nothing speculative about the eventual mortality of any leader, as Max Weber noted long ago. He saw much of human accomplishment, from the world\\'s religions to the great railroad companies of the era, as the work of revolutionary individuals whose legacies survived only when their wisdom was preserved in institutions. Those institutions inevitably become less radical over time, as obedient disciples take over and eventually form a less innovative, more risk-averse bureaucracy. It\\'s not an especially auspicious way to look at Apple\\'s future. But it suggests that whatever happens, the spirit of Steve Jobs will live on within Apple, and when it finally has to, Apple will carry on without him.'),\n",
       " (\"Real World Woes for Disney's Ideal Town\",\n",
       "  '2010-12-29',\n",
       "  'Walt Disney (DIS) built Celebration, Fla., as an idealized vision of a circa-World War II small town, where litter-free streets are lined with homes, some featuring white picket fences and front porches. That doesn\\'t mean Celebration can escape 21st century problems. The town\\'s foreclosure rate is about double the state\\'s, as homeowners who paid a premium for a version of utopia fall behind on their mortgages. In December a resident on the verge of losing his house shot himself after a 14-hour standoff with police. Three days earlier the 16-year-old town had its first murder when a man was bludgeoned with an ax. \"A lot of people bought homes in Celebration thinking Tinker Bell had sprinkled the town with pixie dust,\" says Michael Olenick, chief executive officer of mortgage data firm Legalprise in West Palm Beach. \"Reality is hitting hard.\"The foreclosure rate in Celebration since the beginning of 2009, based on notices that initiate cases, is one for every 20 residents, compared with one per 48 in Florida as a whole, according to Legalprise. Celebration home values have dropped as much as 60 percent from their 2006 peak, while statewide values are down 51 percent, data from Seattle-based research firm Zillow.com show. Foreclosures in Celebration are occurring at a higher rate in part because property owners in financial trouble are walking away from vacation homes in the town, where real estate sells for about 30 percent more than it does in surrounding communities, according to Olenick. Before the recession, people were willing to pay more for living in a Disney \"fantasyland,\" he says.Craig Foushee, 52, barricaded himself in his home on Dec. 2, shooting at sheriff\\'s deputies and members of a SWAT team before turning the gun on himself. His home had been in foreclosure since October 2009, according to legal filings.The Osceola County Sheriff\\'s Office says there is no connection between Foushee\\'s death and the murder of Matteo Giovanditto, 58, who was killed in late November by an acquaintance who confessed, according to a statement on the website of the Sheriff\\'s Office. Residents are \"in shock\" after the deaths, says Angela Sessoms, who has lived in Celebration for 10 years. She recalls visitors saying the town looked like the set of a Disney movie. \"With the SWAT team, the roads barricaded, and the school in lockdown, it was like a different kind of movie set,\" she says.Disney started building Celebration in 1994, and the first residents arrived in 1996. Located on the southern border of Disney World, 25 miles south of Orlando, it was designed by Robert A.M. Stern, dean of the Yale University School of Architecture, and Jaquelin Robertson of Cooper, Robertson & Partners in New York. The design of the development is called New Urbanism, also known as neotraditionalism, emulating 1950s mixed-use neighborhoods where it was easier to walk than to drive.The 10,000-person town is 12 minutes from Disney World\\'s Magic Kingdom and has a backdoor access road to the park. The median home value, including single-family properties and condominiums, was $250,800 in October, almost twice the $127,300 median value for the entire state, according to Zillow. For $529,000, buyers can get a four-bedroom, 2,800-square-foot home with a wraparound porch on about a sixth of an acre. In the second half of 2006, at the height of the real estate boom, the least expensive single-family house fetched $350,000, according to Kathleen Carlson, owner of Imagination Realty in the town\\'s center. In the same period this year, the lowest sale price was $210,000.Lexin Capital, a New York-based private real estate investment firm, bought the 18-acre Celebration downtown from Disney in 2004. Mike Nunez, a spokesman for the company, didn\\'t return calls seeking comment. Disney still owns some commercial property in Celebration, according to Marilyn Waters, a spokeswoman for the Burbank (Calif.)-based company.The town\\'s Architectural Review Committee maintains strict control over the appearance of properties, dictating paint colors, regulating holiday decorations, and overseeing the size of political signs. Celebration shows its Disney heritage in annual seasonal shows, each with special effects originally designed by the entertainment company. In October leaf-shaped confetti shoots out of lampposts in the village center to simulate colorful falling foliage. During December the posts emit what locals call snoap—soap suds that look like snow. The snow falls four times a night, on schedule, and dissipates without shoveling. \"Two of my grandchildren think we live inside Disney World, with Mickey Mouse,\" says Sessoms. \"Except for the recent violence, I can understand why they would think that.\"The bottom line: Celebration\\'s carefully controlled environment hasn\\'t been impervious to real-world woes such as foreclosures and lower home prices.'),\n",
       " ('Luring Hollywood to Cloud Computing',\n",
       "  '2010-12-02',\n",
       "  'Making a special-effects-laden blockbuster like Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows or an animated hit such as Disney\\'s Tangled—the No. 1 and No. 2 movies in the U.S. last weekend—involves complex computing. Sophisticated algorithms govern the way sunlight plays on moving water or how hair moves; transferring that math into an image takes an average of six hours of computing time per frame. And the processing requirements are growing: The original Shrek, released by DreamWorks Animation SKG (DWA) in 2001, required 10 million to 15 million computing hours to complete. This year\\'s Shrek Forever After needed 55 million hours.Cerelink has a pitch for digital studios and special-effects companies: Rather than build, power, and maintain expensive server farms to do all that computing, outsource it. Companies in other data- or computing-intensive fields already rely on off-site servers and connect to that raw horsepower via the Internet—a setup known as cloud computing. \"The visual effects industry is, at its core, a technology-centered industry,\" says James Ellington, Cerelink\\'s chief executive officer. The company allows studios to \"expand the production line quickly and flexibly without having to take the time to build more infrastructure,\" Ellington adds.In July, DreamWorks Animation became the first studio to sign up with Cerelink. The studio is using its processors in New Mexico to handle some of the computing on the Shrek spin-off Puss in Boots and a sequel to Kung Fu Panda. The deal followed a yearlong trial during which DreamWorks put Cerelink\\'s servers to work on hits including Shrek Forever After. \"Films are requiring more and more technology to enable the visuals,\" says Ed Leonard, chief technology officer at DreamWorks. \"The advantage of the cloud is that I don\\'t have to build out big data centers on my campus.\"While Cerelink, which is based in Corrales, N.M., is far from the power-lunch hot spots of Southern California, its location has advantages. One is cheap energy. Leonard says DreamWorks spends more than $100,000 a month powering each of its data centers in San Francisco, Marin County, and Singapore. Cerelink says it pays 9 cents per kilowatt-hour, compared with 14 cents in Los Angeles. For clients that need ultrafast computing, Cerelink also can access New Mexico\\'s Encanto supercomputer, which can perform 172 trillion calculations a second. Because of the nearby University of New Mexico and research centers such as Los Alamos National Laboratory and the Santa Fe Institute, Cerelink can tap a highly educated labor pool to keep its servers humming.Cerelink started as a consultancy in 2005. One of its four founders, all former Intel (INTC) executives, had worked in public relations and had extensive government contacts, which helped Cerelink win contracts advising economic development projects in places including Vietnam and Uganda. They soon realized their revenues were too dependent on their clients\\' ability to get project funding, and by 2008 \"we were looking at different business models,\" says Rod Sanchez, Cerelink\\'s co-founder and president. New Mexico had instituted a 25 percent tax credit for film and television work in 2002 as a way to entice moviemakers. After Cerelink confirmed that the credit would apply to special-effects and animation work, the company transformed into a cloud-services provider for the industry.DreamWorks will outsource about half of its computing power next year, says Leonard. (A Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) data center in Las Vegas will get some of the business.) Not everyone in Hollywood is as comfortable with the cloud. Richard Kerris, chief technology officer at Lucasfilm, which includes digital-effects powerhouse Industrial Light & Magic, says his clients—mainly big studios such as Warner Bros. and Disney (DIS)—worry about security. \"Whenever a client\\'s content is not in our data center, there can be concerns,\" he says. Speed is also an issue. \"We move many terabytes of data around,\" he says. \"Sending that to a remote service will demand very high bandwidth transfer rates [that are] just not readily available and/or cost-effective.\"Cerelink says its service is secure: It uses dedicated broadband lines to connect with DreamWorks animators, and it isolates the servers running DreamWorks tasks from others in its data center. And the connection is fast enough that an animator in Los Angeles can tweak the shading of a panda\\'s fur, send the command to New Mexico for processing, and have the results register on his screen in less than 20 milliseconds—so speedy that there\\'s no perceptible lag. Leonard says other Hollywood players will inevitably follow DreamWorks\\' lead. \"The guys in the very high end of the business, the Disneys, the Pixars, Weta Digital, all of these guys are keenly interested in using the cloud.\"The bottom line: Cerelink hopes studios and special-effects companies will outsource some of their computing needs to its New Mexico server farm.'),\n",
       " ('How Zynga Is Polishing CityVille',\n",
       "  '2010-11-17',\n",
       "  'On a Friday morning in November, the busiest room at the San Francisco headquarters of Zynga, the online game company, is a high-ceilinged loft space behind a door marked CONFIDENTIAL. Bleary-eyed engineers, mostly men in their 20s and 30s, amble about desks cluttered with Red Bull empties, mindful of a countdown scrawled on a whiteboard: 5 DAYS TO LAUNCH. Zynga\\'s latest title, CityVille, is scheduled to begin its rollout at 6 p.m. Pacific on Nov. 17.Or, rather, was scheduled. The deadline came and went and was pushed back to later in the month to incorporate feedback from early tests. They need to get this one right. Privately held Zynga helped define online social games, the programs played by hundreds of millions of users with their friends on Facebook and other social networks. The game maker\\'s 2009 smash hit FarmVille, in which users plant digital crops and use real money to buy farm implements, has held the No. 1 spot among Facebook applications for the past year, with over 50 million users in October. Founded in 2007 by serial entrepreneur Mark Pincus, Zynga is worth $5.4 billion, according to SharesPost, an exchange for shares of privately held companies. Still, the game industry is \"a very hit-driven business,\" says Edward Woo, research analyst at Wedbush Securities. With social games on track to become a $2.2 billion industry by 2012, according to ThinkEquity analyst Atul Bagga, and contenders like Walt Disney (DIS) and Electronic Arts (ERTS) buying their way into the business through acquisitions over the past year, the pressure is on to make CityVille the new addiction for online gamers. No wonder Zynga delayed.CityVille borrows heavily from SimCity, the classic urban simulation game. Users pave roads and lay railroad tracks to create virtual towns; residents are little computer-controlled characters that walk and drive to and fro. They flourish or languish, depending on how good the player is at urban planning. The game is played within your Facebook page, and once users get a town going they can buy burger joints, coffee shops, and luxury condos, and establish franchise locations in cities built by their Facebook friends. The goal is to increase the population of your town by building more and more sophisticated industries: Small shops become retail empires, villages become metropolises.With five days left till CityVille\\'s scheduled opening, hundreds of game-building details remain. In the CityVille studio, one staffer works the phones, trying to secure rights to a song for the game\\'s soundtrack. Programmers scan lines of code to figure out why the game still won\\'t load properly on Microsoft\\'s (MSFT) Internet Explorer 8 browser. \"We just have to keep nimble,\" Matt Levine, the game\\'s art director, tells his team during a midmorning huddle. One by one, the designers tick off their to-dos: \"3-D batting cages.\" \"Little Italy.\" \"Carousel.\" \"Lighthouse.\"Crafting these things can be time-consuming. Yick Kai Chan, a onetime real-world architect who designed banks and stores, spent an entire day perfecting a digital replica of Rome\\'s Colosseum, and another on the Eiffel Tower. The game also needs to be cute. In fact, Zynga\\'s doe-eyed characters and bulbous objects are optimized for adorability, says Chris Han, a CityVille product manager. \"Aesthetics is the huge driver for demand for virtual items,\" says Han. \"I had to run a linear regression on the cuteness of cows and demand.\" (For example, more people buy pink cows than white ones, even if the white ones produce more virtual milk.) CityVille is a warm and fuzzy place: a chubby chef happily ladling soup, a policewoman smiling warmly while dangling a pair of handcuffs. \"It\\'s harder than you think to make everyone come across as friendly,\" says Sean Kelly, CityVille\\'s general manager.Shortly before noon, Kelly meets with Zynga managers in a conference room papered in Post-it Notes. Good news from the programmers: CityVille\\'s load time—the period between users clicking to open the game and seeing their mini cities on screen—is down by half, to under 10 seconds. (A week later, the time was shaved to 5 seconds.) \"Load time, especially first loads, equals players,\" explains Mark Skaggs, vice-president for product development. \"The longer the wait, the more people drop off.\"Player retention is paramount for Zynga\\'s games, says Pincus. Frequent visitors to CityVille will be most likely to pay for virtual items like gazebos and tennis courts. In the past, only about 1 percent to 3 percent of a social game\\'s users paid for such goods, estimates ThinkEquity\\'s Bagga. Improving that ratio will require careful targeting, so that players are enticed to spend money with just the right suggestions at just the right times. \"With FarmVille it was, \\'Get our marketplace up and working, and get content in it,\\' \" says Skaggs. \"Now I think of it like a store, a curated experience.\" Players building suburbs may be able to buy ranch houses, while players working on their downtowns will find virtual museums.It\\'s these virtual stores that are fueling very real growth. Zynga more than tripled its workforce to 1,300 this year, from 400 at the end of 2009. In September it signed a lease for a new 270,000-square-foot office in San Francisco\\'s Potrero Hill neighborhood—the city\\'s biggest commercial lease in nearly five years. The company adds as many as 1,000 servers per week, and Pincus says technology and infrastructure have become a bigger cost than people.After the noon conference has broken up, Pincus pulls Kelly aside to rattle off a few more tasks. \"Amp up population,\" he says, meaning the game should focus more on the number of residents in each city. \"The best would be if I could visit a city and \\'Like\\' it,\" referring to a popular button on Facebook. He takes a sip of tea. \"What about the ability to fish?\"The bottom line: Zynga is under pressure to extend its string of hit online social games. Its next title, due later this month: CityVille.'),\n",
       " (\"Tom Donohue: Obama's Tormentor\",\n",
       "  '2010-11-03',\n",
       "  'Two days before Halloween, a squadron of protesters from the radical feminist group CodePink showed up in front of the headquarters of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Washington, D.C. The agitators, who were dressed as vampires, produced masks bearing the craggy visage of Thomas J. Donohue, the chamber\\'s white-haired chief executive. Through the wonders of Photoshop, they had given him a wicked set of eyebrows, sharp fangs, and a red-stained mouth.The protesters unfurled a black \"Chamber of Horrors\" banner and chanted, castigating the chamber for spending upwards of $50 million to help flip the leadership of the House of Representatives from Democratic to Republican. \"Help! Help! Dracula Donohue is sucking the blood from me and you!\" they wailed. \"Help! Help! The Chamber of Commerce is making this election even worse. Help! Help! We\\'re under attack. We want our democracy back!\"The 72-year-old Donohue could hear it all from his fourth-floor office, where he was trying not to gloat on the eve of a midterm election that was about to come out almost exactly as he hoped. \"It sounds like our friends are here,\" he said.The head of the Chamber of Commerce—the nation\\'s largest business trade association, with an annual budget of $258 million—doesn\\'t mind being called a bloodsucker or inspiring howls of protest. To the contrary, the opposition lets his members know he\\'s doing his job—which makes them more likely to give money to his organization.During the last two years, empowered by $350 million in donations from corporations such as Dow Chemical (DOW), Goldman Sachs (GS), Chevron Texaco (CVX), and many other anonymous sources, Donohue has emerged as President Obama\\'s most effective antagonist. Almost every time the President introduced a major initiative, the chamber and its leader were primed to attack: New health-care laws imposed a \"burdensome mandate on employers,\" and the Administration\\'s Wall Street reforms would \"choke off\" business\\' access to capital. And don\\'t get Donohue started on the White House\\'s climate change proposals. It didn\\'t matter that Obama helped resuscitate the banking system, bailed out auto manufacturers, and meddled far less with Wall Street than many of his supporters would have wished. Donohue tapped into a powerful vein of discontent within the business community and rode it like a rocket.Perhaps not surprisingly, his enemies were enormously gratified when the chamber stumbled early in its anti-Obama campaign. In August 2009, William Kovacs, the chamber\\'s senior vice-president for environment, technology, and regulatory affairs, called for public hearings on the validity of the climate science that had triggered the Environmental Protection Agency\\'s decision to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. He predicted a spectacular debate much like that surrounding the 1925 Scopes Monkey Trial, in which proponents of evolution and creationism battled in court, a remark that suggested the chamber was as skeptical about the dangerous effects of global warming as some of its Republican allies. The response was swift: Five major companies, including Apple (AAPL) and Nike (NKE), resigned from the board or from chamber membership in the face of the public outcry, and some local chambers distanced themselves from Kovacs\\' comments. \"I think the chamber\\'s approach is somewhat old school,\" Valerie Jarrett, one of the President\\'s senior advisers, complained to the Huffington Post.As the criticism reached a boil, Donohue reminded everybody of why he\\'s a Washington institution who has been around since 1997. He repudiated his senior vice-president\\'s inflammatory statement and moderated the chamber\\'s tone on global warming just enough to calm some of its critics (\"So let me state without equivocation: We, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, support strong action on climate change\"). Donohue also ramped up his organization\\'s fundraising. Its opaque 501(c) operation, which is not legally required to identify its funding sources, poured $32 million into television \"issue\" advertising often critiquing Obama\\'s allies in Congress during this election cycle, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. The vast majority goes to Republican candidates. (Obama and his allies shot back, accusing the chamber of accepting undisclosed funds from foreign corporations, a charge Donohue vehemently denies.) The chamber\\'s partner in the campaign was Karl Rove\\'s American Crossroads, a conservative fundraising group whose president, Steven Law, is a former U.S. Chamber of Commerce general counsel. \"The chamber and the Crossroads groups meet periodically and share information about where they will be engaged in the U.S. Senate and House races in order to make sure that efforts aren\\'t doubled,\" said Jonathan Collegio, a spokesman for Rove\\'s organization, on the eve of the election.On Nov. 2, the Republican Party won control of the House of Representatives and increased its presence in the Senate by six seats, making Obama\\'s chief tormentor even more powerful than he was before. The chamber supported the winner in 38 of 59 contests. \"How do I feel? Tired,\" Donohue said the next day. \"But that\\'s fine. I think our guys did a great job.\"He intends to spend his new political capital by reconfiguring the country\\'s economic policies the same way that large corporations have always wanted to: by cutting taxes, slashing regulation, forging trade deals with foreign countries, and reducing the deficit.He\\'d like to start by chipping away at the President\\'s legislative achievements such as health-care and financial reform, which must still be implemented at the regulatory level. In short, the battles between the chamber and the White House are far from over. \"Oh, hell no,\" Donohue laughs. \"They are in the second inning.\"Donohue\\'s critics have taken notice. \"The chamber can walk into any office on Capitol Hill and the first thing the member of Congress will think about is the $50 million that the chamber spent in this election for them or against them,\" says David Donnelly, director of Public Campaign Action Fund\\'s Campaign Money Watch. \"That\\'s an incredible amount of clout to throw around.\"The night before CodePink\\'s vampires showed up on his doorstep, Donohue presided over a dinner for lawyers and lobbyists from media and pharmaceutical companies including News Corp. (NWSA), NBC Universal, Walt Disney (DIS), Merck (MRK), and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)at the chamber\\'s headquarters. The guests were complaining about people pirating their goods at home and in China.Piracy is a difficult problem to solve, but Donohue was upbeat. He praised Victoria Espinel, the White House\\'s intellectual-property czar. \"She\\'s a good person,\" he said. \"We just need to make sure she has the resources to do her job.\" He said that a bill designed to crack down on intellectual-property theft was winding its way through the Senate and stood a good chance of passing, even in this contentious political environment. \"It\\'s really a bipartisan effort,\" he assured everyone.Waiters appeared with plates of mesclun salad and goat cheese soufflés, accompanied by a Napa Valley chardonnay. Then they returned with the main course: port-wine-and-orange-glazed duckling, paired with a California pinot noir. Donohue kept the conversation flowing as fast as the wine. He joked with a Viacom (VIA.B) lobbyist about the fact that she had only recently left a job on the staff of one of the House\\'s most liberal leaders. \"Congratulations for switching sides,\" he said. He teased a Disney lobbyist about his company\\'s plan to build a theme park in China—warning that it would take forever and to be wary of competition from the country\\'s state-supported businesses. \"He\\'s going to be retired by the time it\\'s done,\" Donohue told the group. \"I told him, \\'Come and see me, and tell me how you like it. Of course, there\\'s going to be one just like it across the street.\\' \"As the waiters circled with warm banana-and-macadamia pudding, the conversation took on a darker tone. Donohue announced that the chamber had been digging into the funding sources of anti-globalization groups that might try to thwart their efforts overseas. \"We found that 50 or 60 percent of their money comes from the same person,\" Donohue said dramatically. He wasn\\'t ready to name names just yet. Instead, he acted like a man with a hand grenade in his pocket who couldn\\'t wait to hurl it. \"It\\'s going to be a story,\" the chamber leader promised. The people sitting around the table seemed baffled. (Later, when asked if he was referring to George Soros, Donohue laughed and said, \"That\\'s a pretty good guess.\")Then, at 8:30 p.m., Donohue glanced at an antique clock on the sideboard and declared that it\\'s the chamber\\'s policy never to keep guests longer than the scheduled time. He bid his lobbyist friends farewell and prepared to head home to Potomac, Md., where he lives with his wife, Liz. \"That\\'s my favorite clock,\" he said.Donohue grew up in Brooklyn and still has the accent to prove it. He got his MBA from Adelphi University in 1965 and in 1976 became a vice-president at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Eight years later, he was named president of the American Trucking Assn., a position he held until the chamber lured him back to be its chief executive officer in 1997. By all accounts, he reinvigorated the association. \"Tom brought to the chamber an enthusiasm that it was lacking,\" says Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). \"I think he turned the Chamber of Commerce into an incredibly effective organization.\"One of the keys to Donohue\\'s success was his zealous approach to fundraising and the way he used the money once he got it. John Castellani, the former president of the Business Roundtable, an association of the CEOs of the largest U.S. companies, remembers overhearing Donohue berating Phil Condit—who was Boeing\\'s (BA) CEO at the time and the roundtable\\'s chairman—for not giving the chamber more money. \"Well, I\\'m the chairman of the Business Roundtable,\" Condit replied. Donohue wasn\\'t put off. \"Yeah, but if you would give the money to the chamber, we\\'d get these issues settled,\" he said, suggesting that there was no question which lobbying group he thought was more effective.His members see Donohue\\'s relentlessness as a primary virtue. \"I think they admire his tenacity, his enthusiasm, and his working style,\" says Jim Owens, the ex-Caterpillar (CAT) CEO who retired this year. \"In a job like that, you have to have an outgoing personality; otherwise, you just become part of the bureaucracy in Washington. I think there are a lot of people in the business community who are glad he hasn\\'t become part of the bureaucracy.\"Under Donohue\\'s leadership, the chamber underwent a dramatic shift. Previously, it focused primarily on legislation. But with his newly amassed war chest, Donohue began to inject the organization much more aggressively into electoral politics. The chamber started endorsing \"probusiness\" candidates, most of them Republicans, and spending money on advertising to get them elected. \"We\\'ve always been involved in the political process,\" Donohue says. But, he adds, the chamber \"didn\\'t really start spending money until I came back.\"Along the way, Donohue became friendly with a number of U.S. Presidents. He had a long relationship with George H.W. Bush, whom he found \"very interesting.\" He\\'s even more ebullient discussing Bush\\'s successor: \"I think Clinton was a fascinating guy,\" he chuckles. \"You could always do a deal with Clinton—as long as you watched out for the deal he did with the next guy.\" Of George W. Bush, he says: \"I liked Bush Two as a person. I thought he showed a lot of courage in difficult times.\" He leaves it at that.The warmth drains out of Donohue\\'s voice entirely when he talks about Obama. The chamber supported the President\\'s $787 billion stimulus package. But Donohue took it personally when the Administration banned lobbyists in the White House. \"I think what we do is highly honorable,\" he says.It wasn\\'t long before the chamber and the White House were locked in disagreement. Ever the shrewd Washington operator, Donohue employs a classic tactic when he explains why he opposed nearly every major legislative step the Administration took: He was all for health-care and Wall Street reform, he says. He just didn\\'t like the proposals the Democratic-controlled Congress came up with.What Donohue says he objected to in the Administration\\'s efforts, predictably, were the new regulations in the White House-backed health-care and financial reform legislation. \"We are going to have a regulatory tsunami,\" Donohue says. \"We had to look at the possibility that we were moving from a government of the people to the government of the regulators.\" Donohue\\'s message was indistinguishable from that of the Republican National Campaign Committee.In response, White House official Amy Brundage e-mailed this statement: \"There are fundamental disagreements between the chamber, which vowed to fight against any new regulations, and the President, who believes the regulations are necessary to protect the American people and prevent another financial crisis, which cost more than eight million American jobs.\"Even as the stock market recovered and corporate profits soared, Donohue started on another audacious offensive, to convince the public that CEOs are maligned, underappreciated, and victimized. \"I mean, look at when all the banker guys were up there [in front of Congress],\" Donohue says. \"These are good people. … I mean, [JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO] Jamie Dimon is a good person, and the first thing [the politicians] do, instead of talking about the national crisis, is they spend all their time arguing about how they flew here in corporate jets. By the way, if they had all flown in the same jet, the SEC would have indicted them.\"CEOs are grappling with an uncertain economy, Donohue says, and the whims of shareholders who are apt to call for their ouster unless they deliver stellar returns. \"I mean, bottom line is, the tenure as a CEO isn\\'t what it used to be,\" he says.A cynic might suggest that Donohue is pandering to his constituents. If so, it works. Donohue says that during what he describes as the three-week controversy over climate change, the chamber signed up 100 new companies as members. \"If you want an answer to the question, are we doing all right?\" he says, \"yeah, we are doing really well.\"The chamber\\'s fundraising increased significantly during the year before the midterm election, and Donohue sprinkled $1 million on issue ads in support of Massachusetts Senator Scott Brown, a Tea Party favorite who won the late Edward Kennedy\\'s seat in January\\'s special election, shattering the Democrats\\' filibuster-proof majority in the upper house. Then, almost immediately, the chamber started bombarding the rest of the country with similar spots in the congressional races, in concert with American Crossroads.Not every local chamber welcomed the U.S. chamber\\'s ad campaigns, many of which were starkly negative. \"It\\'s caused a lot of confusion for our members and others who think we\\'re somehow involved in attacking Senator [Barbara] Boxer or Speaker Pelosi, and we\\'re not,\" says Rob Black, vice-president of public policy at the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce.Debbie Braun, president of the Aspen Chamber Resort Assn., has the same complaint. \"We certainly do not agree with their stance on energy, and we are fairly disappointed with the negative advertising that goes on,\" she says. \"Our membership continues to question why we would be affiliated with an organization that isn\\'t aligned with our community goals.\" Donohue says he hears such complaints from local affiliates, but only very rarely.Now, with his strategy having proven effective, Donohue and the chamber are plotting their post-election agenda. A week before the House flipped, R. Bruce Josten, the chamber\\'s silver-maned, Benson & Hedges-smoking chief lobbyist and Mr. Fixit, said that a lot would be unclear after the election, even if the Republicans triumphed. There would be struggles over congressional committee chairmanships and lame-duck shenanigans. But he was certain of this much: The President\\'s change agenda was history. There would be nothing like the Affordable Health Choices Act, no more Keynesian spending. \"He is going to have to operate differently,\" Josten said.Josten did offer a consolation prize: He had suggestions about ways the newly humbled White House could cut some deals with the GOP and still find some legislative victories. As he noted, the White House is already working on a trade agreement with South Korea that could be announced as early as next week. That may not endear the President to his union supporters, but the chamber will applaud.The chamber\\'s chief lobbyist also recommended that the Administration put its support behind a permanent extension of the Bush tax cuts. The White House signaled just before the election that the matter would be considered carefully. Josten would also like to see a corporate tax cut and increased federal spending on infrastructure, which would also be a boon to the private sector. The White House has signaled it will mull these over as well.Donohue says the chamber intends to challenge many of the regulations in the health-care and financial reform acts. It has already sued to keep the EPA from regulating greenhouse gas emissions and to block a provision that would make it easier for shareholders to get their own candidates on corporate boards. \"You may not know we have our own law firm,\" he says proudly. He is still trying not to gloat. \"It\\'s a public-interest law firm. We sue the federal government of the United States 150 times a year on regulatory issues.\" He adds: \"By the way, we win a lot.\"'),\n",

       "  '2010-11-03',\n",
       "  'As Silicon Valley events go, it was an irresistible draw: Marc Andreessen, Web wunderkind turned venture capitalist, interviewing Michael Ovitz, former superagent and co-founder of the Creative Artists Agency.The conversation between the pair of icons, staged last month in a packed conference room in the offices of Andreessen Horowitz—Silicon Valley\\'s newest, hottest venture capital firm—turned out to be a lovefest. Ovitz, the most powerful man in Hollywood before his career imploded in the mid-1990s after a disastrous stint at Disney (DIS), called his friendship with Andreessen \"one of the single most important relationships in my life.\" Andreessen, co-founder of Netscape, the Web browser company whose 1995 initial public offering kicked off the Internet era, said he modeled his VC firm on CAA. \"A lot of what we\\'re trying to do with Andreessen Horowitz is based on what Michael was doing at CAA and his theories about how to build a high-quality service firm,\" Andreessen said.The pantheon of elite venture capitalists, as seen from Silicon Valley, is as indelible as the faces on Mount Rushmore. There\\'s John Doerr, who invested in Intuit (INTU) and Amazon.com (AMZN); Mike Moritz, backer of Google (GOOG) and Yahoo! (YHOO); and Vinod Khosla, the Sun Microsystems co-founder who helped propel Silicon Valley\\'s cleantech wave, among others. Every so often an upstart tries to carve his own visage into the granite. At 39, Marc Andreessen, who first made the cover of Time magazine almost 15 years ago, thinks now is his moment to grab a chisel. With his longtime business partner, Ben Horowitz, 44, Andreessen raised $300 million last year amid the miasma of the recession and made big, loud bets on such companies as Foursquare, which lets people broadcast their arrival at shops, bars, and restaurants, and Skype, the Internet calling service. Skype, which could go public as early as next year, received $50 million from the pair, who were part of the syndicate of investors who spun it out of eBay (EBAY).While many other VC firms are still reeling from a decade of weak returns and an influx of competing capital from Russia and China, Andreessen Horowitz is doubling down. On Nov. 3 the firm announced that it has raised a second $650 million fund. (Bloomberg LP, which owns Bloomberg Businessweek, is an investor in Andreessen Horowitz.) The firm also claims a new, Ovitz-inspired approach to venture capital. Andreessen wants to create a full-service VC firm that helps with all the needs of startups, from recruiting to public relations, just as CAA catered to every aspect of career development—and every personal demand—of film stars and directors.Andreessen isn\\'t simply trying to reinvent the Silicon Valley VC. He\\'s also reinventing himself—morphing from visionary entrepreneur and small-time investor into a top-tier venture capitalist, an Ovitz-like power broker at the nexus of tech\\'s largest companies, best deals, and most promising entrepreneurs. \"We worked personally with a lot of great VCs. There is no magic in what they do. They just work incredibly hard at supporting entrepreneurs and their companies,\" Andreessen says, explaining his decision to enter the high-stakes VC game. \"We have a hard time backing off a challenge.\"Despite its novel approach and gobs of cash, Andreessen Horowitz\\'s primary appeal to the Valley\\'s geek-entrepreneurs may be Andreessen and Horowitz themselves. (Befitting its nerd cred, Andreessen Horowitz has a nickname and Web address, A16Z.com, that\\'s a sort of winking word puzzle for left-brainers. If you can figure it out quickly, you qualify.)Andreessen is the tireless, trash-talking grand marshal of Silicon Valley\\'s change parade, who once kept a New York Times \"deathwatch\" on his blog and instructed Old Media moguls at a 2008 Sun Valley conference to sell all their nondigital properties immediately. He sits on the boards of eBay, Facebook, Hewlett-Packard (HPQ), Skype, and Stanford Hospital—and has been at or near the center of just about every major Silicon Valley hiring, firing, coupling, and corporate divorce in recent memory. That includes the resignation of HP Chief Executive Mark Hurd earlier this year for shenanigans involving an expense account and a female contractor. (Andreessen was on the board committee that picked Hurd\\'s successor, Léo Apotheker.)Horowitz, Andreessen\\'s equally astute and alopecic partner, is also an entrepreneurial superhero in the tech startup community. He was a vice-president at Netscape, then chief executive of Andreessen\\'s before-its-time cloud computing startup Loudcloud, which was founded in 1999 to host the websites and e-commerce stores of other dot-coms. He helped rescue the firm during the bust by repackaging it as a software company, changing its name to Opsware, and selling it to HP for $1.6 billion.While Andreessen has curtailed his own blogging, Horowitz\\'s posts have become required reading for Valley entrepreneurs and often reflect both partners\\' views. For example, when Andreessen wanted to publicize his take on the Hurd scandal but was restricted by his board role from talking publicly, Horowitz published an item that slammed critics who thought the HP board had overreacted when it ousted the CEO. He called Hurd\\'s accuser a \"former soft-core porn movie actress\" (she had starred in some saucy R-rated movies) and strongly implied Hurd and the woman had a sexual relationship (which both had publicly denied).Horowitz says the blog post was his idea, though he ran a draft by Andreessen. \"You can\\'t expect people to understand your story and your point of view if you never say it,\" he says. \"You can\\'t just put the facts out there.\"Following that principle, the partners deploy their own power and influence to publicize their second fund and frame Andreessen Horowitz as an elite venture capital firm. An interview list of friendly heavy hitters is given to a reporter, favors are called in, and suddenly the Valley\\'s best and brightest can\\'t heap enough praise on Andreessen Horowitz\\'s early track record. Bill Campbell, the behind-the-scenes executive coach to Steve Jobs and Eric Schmidt, says the new venture capitalists have an enviable camaraderie with young entrepreneurs and have \"climbed up the Sand Hill food chain amazingly quickly.\" Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg talks about how Andreessen is a mentor to Mark Zuckerberg and, given his time at Netscape, has valuable experience facing down a larger, stronger rival. John Donahoe, eBay\\'s CEO, calls while driving to his daughter\\'s water polo game and praises Andreessen as a great listener who \"brings a genuine curiosity about how to help a big company move quickly and innovate.\" Normally press-shy investment banker Frank Quattrone responds to a request via e-mail, using all capital letters: \"NO VC PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTOR HAS SUCH A COMPREHENSIVE VIEW OF THE INDUSTRY FROM AN INSIDER\\'S PERSPECTIVE.\"The business of Andreessen Horowitz is investing in companies that are building the digital future. But its offices, in a two-year-old Sand Hill Road office park owned by John Arrillaga, Andreessen\\'s billionaire father-in-law, are in some ways a throwback to the analog past. They reflect Andreessen\\'s belief that venture capital can learn from old-school service organizations such as talent and advertising agencies.Greeting visitors as they walk in the door is a library, with Andreessen\\'s personal collection of technology books mixed with ominous orange-hued photographs of mushroom cloud explosions from atomic tests. Other walls in the office, decorated from the private collection of Andreessen and his wife, Laura, a lecturer in business strategy at Stanford, are adorned by midcentury paintings from such artists as Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns. In his own spacious office, a liquor cabinet is stocked with A.H. Hirsch and Black Maple Hill vintage bourbon. On his desk, Andreessen displays the Victrola used by a character on the TV show Mad Men, which he bought at auction for $1,000.\"Marc is a guy who believes the past is prologue,\" says Ovitz, who is on the advisory board of Andreessen Horowitz and also invests in it. \"You are dealing with a guy who created the future with Netscape who is basically looking backward for cues on how people behaved, their thought process and creative patterns.\"Andreessen and Horowitz know how their connection to their controversial adviser might look. Ovitz was famous for racking up enemies as easily as 15 percent commissions. \"You need to separate what he did for his clients from what his detractors think and why they think it,\" says Andreessen. \"What he did for and with his clients is legendary. That\\'s the part we\\'re focused on.\"As the partners point out, CAA under Ovitz controlled most of the major writers, directors, and actors in Hollywood. Andreessen contends this type of dominance would be impossible to achieve in Silicon Valley. Anyway, he doesn\\'t really want all the deals—just the best ones. \"When it comes right down to it, there are 15 tech companies a year you actually want to back,\" he says. \"Our fundamental goal is to be a major investor in as many of those 15 as we possibly can, and we are set up to do that.\"The crux of Andreessen\\'s and Horowitz\\'s idea is to organize the firm as a unified high-service organization that provides help to fledgling startups in the areas critical to their survival while offering access to a wide network of people that reaches into other large companies throughout the high-tech community.Other firms, they say, operate more like a collection of independent agents bound by a loose partnership. They can have a dozen venture capitalists—known as general partners—who act as lone gunslingers, finding deals, winning approval of peers for investments, and then catering to and advising those startups on their own. Startups that work with those firms primarily have access only to the advice and personal networks of their individual partner.Andreessen Horowitz\\'s three general partners—the third is former Opsware vice-president and dealmaker John O\\'Farrell—collaborate on finding deals, then decide who is best suited to be the startup\\'s main liaison. They also have a 15-person (and growing) operations staff, unusually large for a VC firm with only three general partners.Most of these other employees at Andreessen Horowitz are called \"partners\"—another cue taken from Ovitz\\'s CAA. They mainly focus on helping the firm\\'s portfolio companies, much as the multiple departments of CAA would swarm over an actress to get her next movie deal—and also schedule her singing coaches, line up endorsements, and make sure she\\'s huge in Japan. Andreessen Horowitz\\'s chief operating officer, a former Opsware senior vice-president named Scott Kupor, aids startups with the logistics of raising money and runs the firm day to day. Teams are devoted to recruiting, public relations, and business development. Other firms have tried aspects of this holistic approach, such as adding a single in-house recruiter. Andreessen Horowitz has six, and they\\'re mapping the Valley\\'s talent pool—building a database of all the top designers, coders, and executives in the community. The firm then uses the data to help fill positions at its startups. It\\'ll even line up talent for friendly large companies, notching favors to be repaid at a later date.Andreessen and Horowitz say the firm\\'s high staff-to-VC ratio frees them personally to focus on making investments and using the force of their reputations to close a deal or persuade an executive candidate to join a startup. Egon Durban, who led the Skype deal as managing director of the private equity fund Silver Lake Partners, calls this kind of persuasion the essence of what Andreessen does best. \"He is a great closer because of who he is,\" he says. \"People really respect him and respect his endorsement. That is pretty powerful when you are in a competitive process, such as trying to recruit an executive.\"It\\'s not clear yet what advantage this system gives the firm when trying to find those 15 elusive winning startups each year. So far, Andreessen and Horowitz appear to be relying on more traditional means: intuition and star power. In the summer of 2009, the pair met with Osman Rashid, the Pakistani founder of Kno, a startup in Santa Clara, Calif., that plans to manufacture a dual-screen tablet for digital textbooks. Some other top venture capital firms, allergic to building actual hardware and fearful of Apple (AAPL) and the impending iPad, passed on the deal.Rashid, who also founded the textbook rental company Chegg, describes his meeting with Andreessen and Horowitz in romantic terms. \"I felt something I haven\\'t had with any other investor before,\" he says. \"It was very fluid. It was right to the point.\" Over the next few months Andreessen Horowitz invested more than $30 million in Kno, about 10 percent of its first fund, and took a majority stake. It\\'s the firm\\'s second-largest bet after Skype. \"Special product, special market, special entrepreneur, special economics,\" Andreessen says with his usual rapid-fire delivery.The tablet, with the shape and thickness of a physical textbook, will go on sale later this year. Everyone in the Valley will be watching to see whether Andreessen Horowitz picked a winner—or suffered its first flop.Since he first burst into the public consciousness in the mid-1990s, proselytizing for the browser and a new medium called the World Wide Web, Andreessen has always been at the forefront of those who believe in technology\\'s promise to reshape and improve our economy and lives. Now that 2 billion people around the world have broadband—and 5 billion own mobile phones—reality is finally catching up to him. \"This is Marc\\'s time,\" says Quincy Smith of Code Advisors, an advisory firm. \"All the things he has been thinking about for the past 15 years are possible.\"The danger for any visionary is being too far ahead of the curve to see how people live now. And Andreessen has sometimes misjudged the pace and direction of technological change. For example, although AOL (AOL) bought Netscape for $4 billion in the heat of the dot-com boom, it fell far short of the Microsoft-toppling revolution Andreessen predicted back then. In fact, Microsoft (MSFT) crushed its rival.In 2004, Andreessen started Ning, an ambitious company that allowed anyone to create and customize a social network. The business was meant to outmaneuver Facebook in the same way the open Web had upended early Internet dial-up services such as AOL. Andreessen rarely brings up Ning these days, though he seeded the company out of his own pocket and ultimately persuaded investors to bet $120 million on it. While he is still chairman of the board and recently installed a former Netscape colleague as its CEO, it is difficult to see his move to the Facebook board in mid-2008 as anything other than a switch to the winning team in the middle of the game. Andreessen disputes that view and believes the Palo Alto (Calif.) company, which now charges people to administer specialized social networks, has turned the corner.Andreessen\\'s new venture capital firm also has its share of skeptics, particularly other VCs who speak only off the record, fearful of the partners\\' influence. They say it\\'s too early to judge whether the firm\\'s approach will produce bounteous financial returns, the only standard that matters in the industry. They also wonder if Andreessen Horowitz is willing to go a bit further than others in tolerating potential conflicts of interest between the companies the general partners are involved in and the startups in which they invest.Andreessen Horowitz\\'s $20 million investment in Foursquare in June, valuing the startup at about $100 million, illustrates how Andreessen Horowitz plunges in where other firms fear to tread. Foursquare solicited bids from major VC firms along Sand Hill Road, but because of their investments in competing companies, such top-tier firms as Kleiner Perkins, Benchmark Capital, and Greylock Partners took themselves out of the running. Although Andreessen sits on the board of Facebook, Foursquare\\'s primary competitor, and receives stock as compensation, Andreessen Horowitz was one of two firms that aggressively pursued Foursquare.Andreessen Horowitz won the deal over rival Khosla Ventures in surprising fashion. During the process, Horowitz told a tech blog that the firm was pulling out, because the startup was vacillating about whether to raise money or sell out to a larger company. (Yahoo had shown interest.) Partners at Khosla Ventures thought they had the deal. Then Foursquare announced the winner of its VC bake-off: Andreessen Horowitz. The investment occasioned bitter whispers up and down Sand Hill Road that Horowitz\\'s blog statement had been a duplicitous head fake and that Andreessen\\'s Facebook directorship gave the firm a tactical edge all along because Foursquare wanted to get close to the massive social network.Dennis Crowley, the co-founder of Foursquare, says he didn\\'t mind Horowitz\\'s public rebuke and concedes he was equivocating about raising the money. He also insists Andreessen\\'s position on Facebook\\'s board did not influence his decision, although he says it does demonstrate the venture capital firm\\'s expertise. \"The fact that they have a deep understanding of social [networks] I think is represented by Zuckerberg\\'s trust in Andreessen,\" he says. Horowitz, not Andreessen, sits on Foursquare\\'s board of directors. \"There is a wall between the relationship I have with Ben and what Ben discusses with Marc,\" Crowley says.Andreessen says that Facebook and Foursquare are fundamentally different companies with different goals and that Facebook\\'s new check-in feature is a small part of its overall business. He acknowledges that his involvements on the boards of Facebook, eBay, and HP may create potential problems. He says he avoids them by keeping certain information confidential and recusing himself from sensitive portions of board meetings that involve areas where his startups compete. The models for these extracurricular activities are Kleiner Perkins\\' Doerr and Jim Breyer of Accel Partners, who sit on the boards of Google and Wal-Mart (), respectively. That gives them unique insight into everything from the state of the global economy to technology trends. \"As entrepreneurs, we always found it to be very valuable to have your VC connected into the broader industry so that if needed, he can plug you into any company that matters,\" Horowitz says.Board seats—which are the primary way VCs exert their influence on startups—could compromise Andreessen Horowitz in another way. The wisdom on Sand Hill Road is that top investors can productively sit on at most 8 to 12 boards at any given time. Andreessen already sits on eight, Horowitz on five. Both will be asked to join more when they begin spending that next $650 million on the hottest startups, which will want to make their active involvement a condition of any investment.Although he toys with the possibility he could effectively sit on up to 15 boards, Andreessen says this \"is the central challenge for us and for other VCs. You are constrained far more by time than money.\" (E-mails from Andreessen to his CEOs come at all hours; Rashid of Kno looks at his in-box and tallies messages from Andreessen, on three different nights, at 2:17 a.m., 2:31 a.m., and 1:31 a.m.) Andreessen says the firm plans to add as many as three general partners over the next few years to lighten the load. The question is whether startups will want to do business with Andreessen Horowitz if they are getting a partner on their board whose name is not on the nameplate.Ovitz says he talks to Andreessen often about the challenges of time management. \"Most of the conversations are probably irrelevant because I have never met a human being with such a fertile mind, photographic memory, and retention ability,\" he says. Ovitz, though, has other insights that may be more helpful. At the end of his public conversation with Andreessen, the ex-mogul said he regretted scorched-earth tactics such as poaching every last movie-director client from the rival William Morris Agency. \"We were too competitive,\" he said. \"If I had to do it again, I\\'d ratchet back.\"Andreessen is quick to point out that Silicon Valley is not Hollywood, and tech companies, including VC firms, find it easier to collaborate on one deal and then compete for the next. He says Andreessen Horowitz is sportsmanlike. Then again, when his firm was launched last year, he said it would focus on small deals and the founders wouldn\\'t take board seats. Things haven\\'t worked out that way. Asked what changed, Andreessen gives a long-winded answer. Pause. Grin. \"We just can\\'t help ourselves,\" he says.'),\n",

       "  '2010-10-21',\n",
       "  '(Fixes reference to U.S. food-service market in the 27th paragraph.)At the end of a wooden pier, a squat red machine the size of a dishwasher hums along with the din of nearby cicadas. The fish-feeder is tossing grain pellets into one of Chen Haiping\\'s nine fish ponds, each as long as a football field, in the town of Shuixi, in China\\'s Guangdong province. It\\'s breakfast time, and thousands of tilapia are thrashing their tails and sticking their mouths into the air to get some of the soy-and-corn mixture. Chen, a 32-year-old former duck farmer with a wispy mustache, has been running this farm for eight years.Before the tilapia, these ponds were filled with shrimp, which the Chinese like. They aren\\'t big fans of tilapia, a foreign fish; the name in Chinese, luofeiyu, refers to tilapia\\'s origins in Africa. It doesn\\'t have much flavor, and it doesn\\'t grow big enough to put in the middle of the table at a family meal. Americans, however, can\\'t get enough of Chinese-raised tilapia, so tilapia it is. The fish, Chen notes, are hardier and don\\'t require as much work. \"Shrimp can die much more easily,\" says Chen, who wears a wide-brimmed straw hat to protect himself from the 95-degree heat.Despite environmental warnings about Chinese-raised tilapia from watchdog groups such as the Monterey Bay Aquarium\\'s Seafood Watch, which publishes an influential best choices/avoid list of seafood and rates Chinese-raised tilapia as \"avoid,\" U.S. consumption keeps rising. In 2009 the U.S. imported 404 million pounds of tilapia, up from 298 million in 2005. Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) imports nearly 200 shipping containers, or 8.8 million pounds, every month, although they will not say how much comes from China. (The company declined to comment.) Domestic fish farmers can\\'t come close to meeting demand. Although there are tilapia farms in the U.S., the fish does better in tropical climates, so most of it comes from Asia or Latin America.As overfishing threatens the world\\'s wild fisheries, aquaculture advocates say fish farms will play a far greater role in feeding people around the world. \"We are no more going to get our seafood from the wild than we get our beef, nuts, fruit from the wild,\" predicts Kevin Fitzsimmons, a professor at the University of Arizona and former president of the World Aquaculture Society. He is also on the board of HQ Sustainable Maritime Industries (HQS), an NYSE Amex-listed company that sells Chinese-raised tilapia. \"It\\'s all going to be farm-raised,\" he says. And there\\'s no fish better suited to this new world than tilapia, says Fitzsimmons. It\\'s a fast-growing species with mild-tasting flesh that producers can easily adapt to all kinds of uses. \"Tilapia,\" says Fitzsimmons, \"is going to be basically where chicken is with poultry.\"That means that the creatures thrashing in Chen\\'s ponds are the future of fish. The growing American appetite has led to a boom in Chinese aquaculture: With hundreds of breeding centers, fish farms, feed mills, and processing plants, China is the world\\'s tilapia superpower. That\\'s why I\\'ve traveled to the heart of the Chinese aquaculture industry, in southern Guangdong and the nearby island province of Hainan, to see how farmed-in-China fish make their way to the American table.For a tilapia, Chen\\'s farm is a pleasant enough place to grow up. The farm is about an hour and a half\\'s drive on potholed roads from Zhanjiang, the closest big city in this part of Guangdong. The province—home to huge factories owned by companies like Taiwan\\'s Foxconn that employ hundreds of thousands of workers and produce iPhones and other products for export—is one of the most polluted areas in one of the world\\'s most polluted countries. Smog regularly fouls the air and chemicals poison the water in the boomtowns of the Pearl River Delta, near Guangdong\\'s border with Hong Kong. Those factories, however, haven\\'t yet made it to the southwest of Guangdong, an area 200 miles away that is still a green oasis of banana trees, rice paddies, and sugarcane farms.The conditions on the fish farms are surprisingly clean. Because tilapia—unlike farmed salmon—grow quickly, they don\\'t need big supplies of antibiotics to keep them healthy. Western media sometimes report on the filthy, algae-filled ponds of Chinese aquaculture. It\\'s true for many mainland farms, especially those raising eel. Tilapia, though, have meat that easily takes on the flavor of whatever the fish happen to have consumed, and tilapia that swim in muddy, algae-filled waters end up with a musty flesh that American consumers hate. Before accepting tilapia from Chinese farms, buyers will check to make sure the fish don\\'t have that pondy flavor. To avoid rejections, Chen and other farmers say, they keep their ponds clear of material that could ruin the tilapia\\'s taste.Doing so requires a lot of water, but Chen doesn\\'t have to worry about paying for it. He takes his water from a nearby canal maintained by the local government, part of a policy to promote the growth of aquaculture through tax breaks and other subsidies. For farmers like Chen, it\\'s a good deal. \"The water,\" he says, \"is free.\"With the hot weather, frequent feedings, and fresh water, fish destined for dinner in the U.S. need just a few months to grow to a harvestable size of 1 to 2 pounds. Soon a handful of Chen\\'s workers will be standing up to their armpits in the water, dragging nets across the ponds and forcing the tilapia all into one end. They\\'ll grab the fish by hand and throw them into buckets onshore. Other workers will dump the containers into a large truck that can carry as many as 10,000 live fish. Then the truck will head off to a processing plant, where the fish will become food.There\\'s no shortage of facilities nearby to do the killing. In one sign of how quickly the industry has taken off, there are 268 factories in the Zhanjiang area that can kill, skin, and freeze tilapia, according to the local aquatic products import and export association. That\\'s a 33 percent increase in just three years.A decade ago, few Americans ate tilapia. The fish didn\\'t even make the top 10 list of consumed seafood in the U.S. until 2002, when it squeaked by with average consumption of just 0.3 lb. a year. Then demand surged in the wake of the Atlantic cod fishery collapse. By 2009, according to data released on Sept. 7 by the National Marine Fisheries Service, Americans ate 1.2 pounds of tilapia. That put the fish well ahead of cod and catfish and just behind pollock as the most popular white fish in the U.S. (Shrimp is the top seafood, at 4.1 pounds consumed per American, and canned tuna the top fish, at 2.5 pounds.)It\\'s not that tilapia is particularly tasty; it simply takes on the flavor of other ingredients. \"It has got nothing going for it,\" says Colin Freeman, a consultant for Pristine Oyster Farm in South Australia. A few weeks before I travel to Chen\\'s farm in Hainan, I\\'m visiting relatives in Brookline, Mass., near Boston, and stop by Wulf\\'s Fish Market, a shop on Harvard Street not far from JFK\\'s birthplace. The store doesn\\'t carry tilapia, an annoyed employee tells me, even though people often ask for it. \"Tilapia,\" he snarls, \"is the tofu of fish.\"Unlike salmon, tuna, and other big ocean fish, tilapia\\'s flesh doesn\\'t contain omega-3 oils, one of the main health benefits of seafood. But because it is cheap and easily raised on farms, it has created an opening for China. Just as Chinese factories are the go-to source for inexpensive toys, electronics, and clothes, the country\\'s aquaculture industry has quickly come to dominate production of cheap, mass-produced fish. According to the U.S. Commerce Dept., about 80 percent of the frozen tilapia in the U.S. is now imported from China, with restaurants and supermarkets the biggest buyers. Tilapia demand \"has grown at a phenomenal rate,\" says Keith Decker, president and chief operating officer of High Liner Foods USA, the Danvers (Mass.) subsidiary of the Nova Scotia-based producer of fresh and frozen seafood. The company is a big importer of cod and haddock, and is now a major buyer of tilapia, which it sells wholesale as well as under its Sea Cuisine brand. The company\\'s products include over 50 types of tilapia meals such as Lemon Pepper Tilapia and Coconut Crusted Tilapia.Tilapia is especially well-suited to American tastes. \"Tilapia fulfills a need for a large portion of the population that doesn\\'t like their fish tasting \\'fishy,\\' \" says chef Rick Moonen, owner of Rick Moonen\\'s RM seafood restaurant at the Mandalay Bay hotel in Las Vegas and author of the 2008 cookbook Fish Without a Doubt. Pollock remains slightly more popular, as measured by per-capita consumption. That\\'s misleading, though, since pollock caught off the coast of Alaska is ground up by McDonald\\'s (MCD) and other fast-food chains and turned into fish sandwiches and nuggets; few people go to their local supermarket or Ruby Tuesday (RT) looking to have pollock for dinner. Tilapia has gained in popularity because one fillet by itself can be a main course. It\\'s what Decker and others in the fish business call a \"center-of-the-plate\" fish. \"Tilapia,\" Decker says, \"has a huge future.\"Given the record of products made in China—milk tainted with melamine, toys with lead, toothpaste with the poisonous chemical diethylene glycol—many Americans may not welcome that future. The U.S. imported $5.2 billion worth of food from China in 2008, with aquaculture products accounting for 41 percent. A report last year from the U.S. Agriculture Dept.\\'s Economic Research Service called into question Chinese safety standards for farm-raised fish and seafood. \"Fish are often raised in ponds where they feed on waste from poultry and livestock,\" the report said. Meanwhile, environmentalists are concerned about the impact of China\\'s fish farms, as water filled with tilapia feces is flushed from the ponds. They also worry about the invasive nature of the species in the U.S. (Last year in Louisiana\\'s Plaquemines Parish, for example, officials used poison to kill off tilapia in the area\\'s canals and ditches.) \"In theory there is quite a lot of regulation in place,\" says Pete Bridson, aquaculture research manager at the Seafood Watch program in Monterey, who traveled to China last year to visit tilapia farms. \"But the environmental side of the regulation is not enforced very well.\"A global aquaculture industry dominated by China worries Mike Picchietti, president of Regal Springs Tilapia, a company based in Bradenton, Fla., that operates tilapia farms in Indonesia, Honduras, and Mexico, and is a supplier to Costco (COST). For instance, he says Chinese farmers save money using fish feed only when the tilapia are bigger. When they\\'re still young, he says, farmers toss animal waste in the ponds and allow the tilapia to feed on the algae bloom that follows. \"They\\'re able to cut their feed costs because they\\'re able to use manure,\" he fumes. Raised-in-China tilapia are therefore much cheaper, according to Picchietti. \"The Chinese are able to use cowshit,\" he says, \"and I can\\'t.\" Chinese tilapia growers deny Picchietti\\'s claim.As the sun sets and people elsewhere in the city are heading home for dinner, at Guangdong Evergreen\\'s processing plant near Zhanjiang, employees are gathered near the loading dock, preparing to start their shifts. Trucks are arriving with thousands of freshly harvested tilapia, and the fish need to be killed and processed quickly to ensure they are as fresh as possible before going into the deep freezer. Guangdong Evergreen has made agreements with farmers to buy their harvest-ready tilapia for processing. This factory is where fish from farmer Chen Haiping\\'s ponds will meet their maker.For workers and visitors alike, entering the plant is no simple procedure. They must first change into a head-to-toe white suit, making sure to take off all watches, rings, and jewelry, and put on a face mask. After washing their hands thoroughly, visitors walk through a pool of disinfectant and then into the plant itself.Inside, hundreds work in silence as fish come off the loading dock. First, workers kill each fish by jabbing it in the head with a knife. Then they leave the dead tilapia to sit so the blood drains out of its body. Next the fish go onto a conveyor belt and the process speeds up as workers swiftly fillet the fish. With their pay partially determined by the number of fish they can process in an hour, the best workers can do this with just four cuts of the knife. After dropping the head, tail, and other remains on the floor to be picked up later, the men (women work elsewhere on the line, but the cutters are almost always men) put the six- to eight-ounce fillet back on the conveyor belt. Soon, different workers skin the fillet, followed by others who trim off any leftovers. Within a few minutes, workers are readying the fish for the freezer.Other plants follow similar procedures. At the one operated by HQ Sustainable Maritime Industries, an Evergreen rival with offices in Seattle and Hainan, the clean suits are color-coded: Visitors wear white; assembly-line workers, blue; managers, red; quality-control supervisors, yellow. On a recent visit to the factory, plant manager Wang Fusheng points to a yellow-suited officer roaming the fluorescent-lit room. \"That guy is powerful,\" he explains. \"He can stop anything right away.\" Before HQ\\'s fillets go into cold storage, the fish pass through a metal detector, just in case any stray flecks of a filleting knife have made their way into the product. \"Every day we account for how many knives we\\'ve given to workers,\" he says. \"If one knife is missing, you check everything.\"Executives with tilapia processors in China point to such requirements as examples of their determination to maintain product safety. Chinese government labs regularly inspect for melamine and other banned additives; some Western buyers have their own quality inspectors or rely on third-party auditors to test the fish. Given the frequent inspections by Chinese officials and Western nongovernmental organizations, HQ Sustainable Chief Executive Officer Norbert Sporns rejects accusations that Chinese tilapia is substandard. \"China is the most scrutinized export market in the world,\" says Sporns. He\\'s a six-foot-seven former immigration lawyer from Montreal who got involved in Chinese aquaculture in the late 1990s; his wife, HQ Chairman Wang Li, is the daughter of a former chamber of commerce chairman in Hainan. Sporns compares Chinese tilapia farms favorably to catfish farms in Louisiana, where he calls conditions \"despicable.\" \"Our standards,\" he says, \"are way, way better.\"In addition to operating processing plants, both HQ Sustainable and Guangdong Evergreen produce fish feed for farmers—and executives reject the assertion that local farmers reduce costs by feeding the fish animal waste. In the past, some Chinese may have cut corners that way, but inspectors—from the government and from independent certification bodies like the Aquaculture Certification Council, based in Crystal River, Fla.—have put an end to the practice, they say. \"No one dares do that now,\" says Lee Shuguang, an Evergreen manager.Critics have plenty of other concerns. Costco, for instance, won\\'t purchase tilapia raised on Chinese farms because of concerns about mainland production standards. Its tilapia comes from Regal Springs Tilapia. (Prices vary locally, but at the Costco in Yonkers, N.Y., fillets are $5.49 a pound; the nearby Sam\\'s Club sells its tilapia for $4.77 a pound.) \"China\\'s track record in certain areas isn\\'t perfect,\" says Bill Mardon, a seafood buyer for Costco. He singles out Chinese processors\\' use of a glaze on frozen fillets. It contains carbon monoxide, which preserves the color of the fish and can make a fillet look fresher than it is. \"Even if the fish starts to go bad, the fish will look good,\" says Mardon. For the consumer looking at a frozen tilapia fillet, \"the first line of defense is visibility,\" he says. \"If the carbon monoxide takes this away, it\\'s kind of dangerous.\"Evergreen manager Liu Xie calls this unfair, and says the company is only responding to its customers. \"Supermarkets want us to do this,\" he says. \"It doesn\\'t have any effect on people; it\\'s just to preserve the color.\" Regulators in the U.S. and the European Union allow carbon monoxide, he adds. Liu says some fish get coated and some don\\'t, depending on the customer\\'s specifications. Either way, the fish then go into the freezer, set to -36C. That\\'s cold. \"If you freeze a man at minus 40 degrees,\" HQ plant manager Wang explains helpfully, \"he will keep forever.\"Chinese aquaculture officials object strongly to Seafood Watch\\'s \"avoid\" recommendation. \"They don\\'t believe in aquaculture,\" Sporns says. \"The Monterey Bay Aquarium makes money off of ocean fish.\" Tilapia, a small and visually nondescript omnivore, is not a fish that captures the imagination of aquarium goers. \"How many tilapia do you see there?\" asks Sporns. \"None.\"For $23.95, diners at La Hacienda de San Angel, a new restaurant at Walt Disney World, can have grilled tilapia with roasted corn, cactus leaves, and mango chutney. The entrées at Daddy Jack\\'s New England Lobster & Chowder House in Dallas include sautéed tilapia with lemon scallion butter and stuffed tilapia with Ritz cracker crabmeat stuffing. The Olive Garden in Rockaway, N.J., offers parmesan-crusted tilapia with vegetables and angel hair pasta for $14.95.As tilapia becomes more common on menus across the U.S., many eateries are turning to Sysco (SYY), America\\'s largest distributor of food to restaurants, hospitals, and schools. With 400,000 customers, Houston-based Sysco has 17 percent of the $200 billion total U.S. food-service market, and those customers want more tilapia. \"In the last six years, it\\'s been growing about 20 percent a year,\" says Butch Vidrine, director of seafood purchasing for Sysco. He likes the fish\\'s versatility: \"You can fry it, grill it, barbecue it; you can do everything to it.\"Responding to that demand, Sysco has become a big buyer of frozen tilapia. About 95 percent of the company\\'s tilapia sales are frozen, says Vidrine. For years, Sysco bought frozen fish from Regal Springs farms in Indonesia and wouldn\\'t consider buying tilapia from China. Recently, Sysco changed its policy, approving a Chinese processor this summer. Given the 30 to 50 percent lower prices of Chinese tilapia and the growing demand for the fish, Vidrine says, it\\'s time to give China a try. \"China is like the Wild West,\" he says. \"Some will meet [standards]. Some won\\'t.\"Tilapia from China is making inroads elsewhere. In September, Whole Foods Market (WFMI) locations in California started carrying the Lillian\\'s Healthy Gourmet line of prepared frozen tilapia meals made by HQ Sustainable. At the other end of the shopping spectrum, tilapia fillets from China are in the freezer sections of Wal-Mart superstores around the country, selling under the Sea Best name. The two ingredients are: \"Tilapia\" and \"Carbon Monoxide (To Retain Natural Color).\"Although Las Vegas chef Rick Moonen is a tilapia convert, he won\\'t sell Chinese-raised tilapia at his 17,000-square-foot restaurant—complete with raw bar, sushi bar, and three private dining rooms—at the Mandalay Bay because Seafood Watch tells him not to. \"I pretty much follow their guidelines when making choices at my restaurant,\" says Moonen, 54.A graduate of the Culinary Institute of America and co-founder of the three-star restaurant Molyvos in New York, Moonen used to dismiss tilapia. That\\'s changed. Fish Without a Doubt includes 13 tilapia recipes. In early September, Moonen was one of five of Bravo\\'s \"Top Chef Masters\" participating in a competition to create the best new dish for spectators at the U.S. Open tennis tournament; Moonen\\'s entry was a burger-like combination of shrimp and tilapia. \"I love the fish,\" he says. \"I think it\\'s very versatile.\" He serves non-Chinese tilapia at his restaurant in dishes like fish tacos.If it is going to win over Seafood Watch and Moonen, China\\'s aquaculture industry needs to address concerns about tilapia and the environment. The World Wildlife Fund is one of several green groups introducing new standards for tilapia farming. \"You don\\'t want to tarnish the biggest sector just because there are some bad actors,\" says Aaron McNevin, an aquaculture specialist at the WWF who has worked with industry executives in China and the U.S. to identify farms that try to improve their sustainability records. \"Of course there are some bad actors, because China has the most producers,\" he says. \"But there are some groups in China that have raised the bar.\"The new standards might help with environmentalists, but a bigger concern for Chinese fish farmers is facing the relentless pressure for lower prices from foreign buyers. For all the popularity of Chinese-raised tilapia, a common complaint among people in the industry is the difficulty of making money selling the fish for export. This is another area where Chinese aquaculture is like Chinese manufacturing: Both are at the mercy of buyers like Wal-Mart, which demands ever-lower prices even as costs rise along the production chain. \"Land costs, labor costs, raw material costs, they\\'ve all gone up 20 to 30 percent in the last three years,\" says Chen Dan, chairman of Guangdong Evergreen. Brokers buying fish for the U.S. market don\\'t care, says Shen Jian, secretary general of the local aquaculture association. \"The price is too low,\" he gripes. \"It\\'s unfair.\"Chinese producers are focusing on ways to eke out more profits. Evergreen hopes to figure out how to air-freight containers of fresh tilapia to the U.S., since fresh prices are about 50 percent higher than frozen. HQ Sustainable is focusing on value-added products such as facial creams made with collagen from tilapia scales, and it may spin off on the Shanghai stock exchange the subsidiary that makes these supplements.HQ Sustainable CEO Sporns also dreams of working with a partner to create a fish feed that contains omega-3, the healthy fish oil that tilapia lacks. \"If you have tilapia meal enriched with omega-3, that makes for a healthier tilapia,\" he says. \"Then we\\'ve got checkmate.\"Back in southwestern Guangdong, farmer Chen is focusing on more short-term solutions. Taking shelter under a tree from a midday cloudburst, he puffs on his bamboo water pipe and explains how the economics of tilapia have suddenly turned against him. With China\\'s economy booming, costs are up sharply. His rent—which was just 500 yuan ($75) per mu (equal to about 79 square yards)—has more than doubled. Pay for his dozen full-time workers and 15 part-timers has jumped 40 percent, to 1,500 yuan a month. Feed and electricity costs are up, too. Meanwhile, the price he can get for his fish hasn\\'t kept pace. Last year, 10 percent of the Zhanjiang region\\'s tilapia farmers gave up on farming the fish.Chen has thought about giving up, too, but for now he\\'s sticking with tilapia. He can\\'t do anything about the increase in his fixed costs, so he is trying to make up for smaller margins with greater volume. To do that, Chen has made his ponds deeper, making room for 20 percent more fish. \"We can grow bigger fish,\" he says hopefully. \"And more fish.\"'),\n",

       "  'Josh Bank is a cheerful guy in a red-checked shirt and pressed khakis with millions of young women under his influence.On this Sunday morning in Los Angeles, several of those women are on the set of his new Web series, Hollywood Is Like High School with Money. Bank, 42, the president of Alloy Entertainment (ALOY), is one of the creative forces behind hits like the television show Gossip Girl and the novel and movie The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants. Perched in a director\\'s chair, his eyes alert, Bank watches two actresses run through lines he thought up with another set of charges, the mostly young, mostly female editors and writers who churn out stories for him at Alloy.\"I love the idea of a teenager giving an adult rules about how to survive in Hollywood. It still makes me laugh,\" says Bank about his show, which revolves around Quinn, the high school Queen Bee, who teaches a hapless studio assistant named Taylor how to outmaneuver a ruthless rival. Then he turns serious, describing the icy derision that is the signature mood of Alloy stars, many of whom are studies in the Machiavellian teen. \"I insisted when we were writing the script that Quinn be absolutely intolerant of everything Taylor does in that classically teenage girl way,\" he says. \"Quinn doesn\\'t give an inch.\"The other millions of young women under Bank\\'s influence? They watch Alloy\\'s Twilight knockoff, The Vampire Diaries, and Huge, the critically acclaimed show about teens at a fat camp. They read Alloy books like the best-selling series Pretty Little Liars, which was conceived as Desperate Housewives for teens; eight such products have been on The New York Times best-seller list this year. Nearly 21 million teens logged on to Alloy\\'s websites in September, according to tracking service comScore (SCOR), and 6 million see Alloy\\'s ads on its in-school television network, Channel One News. Private, Alloy\\'s first Web series, got 14 million hits and convinced Bank and the other executives that their digital future had arrived.On the Web, Alloy hopes to do what it can\\'t on television or in film: control the content, the distribution, and the advertising sales, and thus the profits, for its shows. If all goes according to plan, Alloy could be a digital studio and broadcaster in one. It could own the teenage girl, and maybe even the holy grail of demographics, prized for its spendthrift, trendsetting ways: the 18- to 34-year-old woman. Maybe Hollywood really is like high school: Rule No. 1, says Quinn, is \"Be aggressive.\"In June, Strauss Zelnick, head of the private equity firm ZelnickMedia, and other investors paid $126.5 million to acquire Alloy Entertainment and its publicly traded parent company, Alloy Inc., which also includes a youth marketing and research firm. When the deal closes later this year, Alloy will have an ambitious owner in Zelnick, who was once president of 20th Century Fox and is also trying to revive video gamemaker Take-Two Interactive (TTWO). \"I expect them to be nothing less than the most important entertainment company serving the youth market,\" he says. With Zelnick comes a new chairwoman, Geraldine Laybourne, who pretty much invented the cable channel Nickelodeon and founded another, Oxygen Media, and now wants to influence a new generation. She used to tell Sumner Redstone, her boss at Viacom (VIA.B), that Nickelodeon wasn\\'t just a channel, it was a lifestyle. She has something similarly grand in mind for Alloy. \"We can get under the skin of this huge market,\" she says, noting that teens are at once ubiquitous and elusive. \"Are we going to be an important content creator and brand for young adults? Yes. What shape that takes, I don\\'t know. We\\'re creating something new.\"In some ways this is Alloy\\'s own coming-of-age tale. The company wants to grow up on its own terms, idiosyncrasies intact. And it\\'s doing so just as those millions of teen girls are getting hold of the mobile technology that could let Alloy\\'s stories beguile them almost anywhere. There may or may not be a TV in the 21st century teenager\\'s bedroom, but there will quite likely be a laptop or tablet. \"I\\'m excited about what the iPad means for this generation,\" says Laybourne. \"Once tablets are in their hands, Alloy is perfectly positioned to create new content.\"Online video is already huge. Eighty-four percent of the 213 million Internet users in the U.S. now watch an average of 14 hours of video a month, according to comScore. And in September, ads accounted for more than 12 percent of all videos viewed online.Other companies, of course, share Alloy\\'s ambitions. Over on Sony\\'s (SNE) well-funded crackle.com, the most popular series, The Bannen Way (about a con man doing one last job), drew 13 million views in its first two months. Results like that are bringing the traditional television players into webcasting—again. They tried it a few years ago, and when those attempts failed they scaled back their plans. Now the networks and big studios are aiming higher with original Web series. NBC is airing a comedy, FCU: Fact Checkers Unit, about magazine assistants trying to confirm celebrity gossip. Lionsgate (LGF) recently announced it will produce its first Web show, a 24-episode animated series called Trailer Trash.The real experiments, weird and funny, are (no surprise) occurring outside Hollywood. CollegeHumor, which is owned by Barry Diller\\'s IAC (IACI), has 15 million monthly users who watch shows like Hardly Working, the absurdist sketches that star CollegeHumor\\'s staff and are filmed in its offices. At My Damn Channel, the independent Web studio, the most popular original series so far is You Suck at Photoshop, a combination tutorial and comedy routine that\\'s been seen more than 24 million times.Seen by whom? Quite likely young men. If there is a market in which teen girls are underserved, digital entertainment may be it. Vuguru, the studio founded by Walt Disney\\'s (DIS) former chief executive officer, Michael Eisner, offers a few such shows, including Prom Queen, a series of 90-second episodes that has attracted 11.1 million views. And the new MTV Scratch is going after millennials from all angles. But so far no one can really match Alloy\\'s near-obsession with the fantasies and anxieties of young women. \"They want to be the place for everything that teenage girls want,\" says Reed Phillips III, co-founder of media investment bank DeSilva+Phillips. \"Their chance of success is pretty high.\"For its first online shows, Alloy adopted a conventional Internet model, where the advertiser pays for the series. Hollywood Is Like High School is a 10-episode, seven-figure Web production, with all seven figures coming from L\\'Oréal. Even with advertisers bankrolling the programs, however, Alloy doesn\\'t quite break even. For now that\\'s close enough for Matt Diamond, CEO of Alloy. He thinks economies of scale will eventually work in Alloy\\'s favor, particularly if it can turn some of the series into feature films, as it\\'s doing with Private, now in development, or into television shows.Inside the Alloy empire, there are few worries about protecting creative work from the influences of advertisers, unlike in many more traditional media organizations. This may be due in part to the backgrounds of Diamond and Leslie Morgenstein, the CEO of Alloy Entertainment. Diamond, 41, worked at General Electric (GE) and got his MBA from Harvard before he and a friend started Alloy in 1996 as a youth marketing company. Four years later, he bought Morgenstein\\'s book-packaging business, 17th Street Productions; Morgenstein, now 43 and with an MBA of his own, brought in Bank, a college friend from Sarah Lawrence College who was working at an advertising firm. All three are understated, unthreatening, apparently uncomplicated. Their hair is short, their shirts are tucked in. They\\'re married and have kids. They run and play golf. The widget they sell just happens to be the attention span of teenage girls.\"The goal is to make advertisers super happy and make us super happy,\" Morgenstein says. \"They don\\'t want to write the script,\" adds Diamond. \"But they won\\'t put money into something that won\\'t ultimately be a good ad campaign.\"Two months after L\\'Oréal signed on to Hollywood, executives from the company were reading over the script. \"They were very helpful in saying where they\\'d like to see their product,\" says Bank. The second episode\\'s script reflects this cooperation: \"Stage Note: Quinn applies Telescopic Explosion Mascara and primps in front of the mirror. In her bathroom we see 360 Go Clean, L\\'Oréal Hairspray, Infallible Lip Gloss, True Match Roller, True Match Blush, eyeliners and lipliners.\"On the set, advertisers were just as helpful. \"If the sponsor sees something they don\\'t like, they\\'ll speak up and we\\'ll change it,\" says Tripp Reed, an independent filmmaker who joined Alloy to produce its digital programs. L\\'Oréal executives declined to comment.In September, Alloy also introduced a series called First Day, created expressly for Kmart (SHLD). It\\'s a comedy about a girl who relives her first day at a new high school, in different Kmart clothes each time, until she gets it right. Kmart executives had one concern: no mean girls. That might sound crippling—like having a superhero without a villain—but Alloy complied. \"We really just tweaked some of the dialogue,\" says Andrew Stein, the vice-president of marketing and planning. \"It wasn\\'t that difficult.\" When the shows air, viewers can click on certain outfits and be taken straight to Kmart\\'s website to buy them.Does this relentless focus on product make the stories suffer? Bank and Morgenstein say it doesn\\'t. \"There\\'s never been a case where we felt we sacrificed quality,\" says Diamond. But working so closely with companies is likely more challenging than they let on. Laybourne, who brought advertising to Nickelodeon, concedes that in general, \"The sales process in branded entertainment often gets in the way of figuring out the best creative solution.\" So even as it starts work on a third series, Talent (backed by Procter & Gamble (PG)), Alloy is looking to reestablish some boundaries. It will continue to produce as many as eight branded shows a year, but it also wants to finance its own programs. Advertisers, Morgenstein says, will have nothing to do with the content. They\\'ll buy airtime and maybe some product placement. \"We still want advertisers to play with us, but we want to fence them off a little bit,\" he says. \"We\\'ll walk right up to the edge. It will be more like what we\\'ve done on TV.\"Zelnick already seems to be enjoying the possibilities at Alloy. \"Do we get engaged in reality shows?\" he asks. \"What use do we make of the enormous reach of our digital network?\" Diamond, who helped take Alloy private and will stay on as CEO, offers his own riff on Alloy\\'s future. \"We\\'re at an inflection point,\" he says. \"Gerry got what others don\\'t: This is a system that can feed a much bigger media engine. We want to be a more important media company to youth. We want them to know us.\"Alloy has never really promoted itself. Now, though, \"It\\'s necessary for them to become a brand, particularly if they are trying to be the MTV for teenage girls,\" says Phillips. \"It\\'s necessary if they want to build value with an eye to selling the company in three to five years.\"Back on set, Bank is saying, \"Someone get her a lobster bib!\" Taylor is eating cheese-drenched nachos, and he doesn\\'t want to see a costume ruined. Between takes, he tells the actress playing Iris, the studio boss, to put her hand up to end a conversation. \"Iris doesn\\'t pause,\" he notes. Then he leans back in his chair to muse on what all this means for Alloy. \"The computer and TV will become one,\" he says. \"I don\\'t know when, but they will.\" And that\\'s how millions of young women—who are way ahead of him here—have Bank under their influence.'),\n",

       "  'There\\'s something mysterious about the new Apple TV—a black hockey puck-size box that connects to your hi-def set. It\\'s from Apple (AAPL), so it must be cool, right? What does it do, though? The answer: Some entertaining stuff right now, and maybe a lot more down the line.Apple has been nibbling around the edges of the living room for years with Apple TV, originally a set-top box that stored and played purchased movies and that Chairman Steve Jobs called a \"hobby.\" The new Apple TV has been shrunk to a quarter of its former size, the price has been slashed from $229 to $99, and, most important, it no longer includes a hard disk to store video. Apple TV is now built around its ability to use your home Wi-Fi network to stream high-definition movies and shows, photos, and music—from online sources or your computer—to your television.Setup is easy: Connect it to your set via an HDMI cable and plug in the power. Then just follow the on-screen instructions to introduce it to your Wi-Fi network and iTunes Music Store account. Instead of using Apple TV\\'s included remote control to key in your password letter by letter on the big screen, download Apple\\'s free Remote app for your iPad, iPhone, or iPod Touch, and enter your text from there. (It\\'s particularly useful if your user name is 11 letters long.)With no way to store purchased content on the new Apple TV, you\\'ll probably use it mostly to view movies and shows rented from the iTunes Store. The movie selection has thousands of HD titles starting at $3.99. The TV selection, however, is limited: The only major U.S. networks signed on to Apple\\'s 99 cents-an-episode menu are Fox (NWS) and ABC (DIS). (Jobs is the largest shareholder in Walt Disney (DIS), ABC\\'s owner.) Once you rent something, you have 30 days to start watching it, then 24 hours (for movies) or 48 hours (for TV shows) to finish. There are a few other programming sources. Netflix (NFLX) customers can get access to its Watch Instantly movies and TV shows straight from the device; and Apple TV can also tap into YouTube (GOOG) videos, podcasts, and Internet radio. It even makes it easy to view movies and photos stored on your computer.Apple TV\\'s 720p-quality video provides a consistently crisp, smooth picture, with none of the stuttering that sometimes mars streamed content. The one blemish I encountered was that the device occasionally grossly overstated how long it would take to begin watching a movie after selecting it. In one case it gave me an estimated wait time of 371 minutes, when the actual delay was less than four minutes. Other movies began playing in a minute or two. Apple claims momentary glitches in my Internet service might have been to blame for the erroneous warnings.This being Apple, more slick functions are on the way. After a software update promised for next month, you\\'ll be able to stream video to the Apple TV from an iPad, iPhone, or iPod Touch. You can begin a movie on a mobile device, walk into your home, and—voilà—have it appear on the big screen in your den. (Unfortunately, the process won\\'t work in reverse.)Apple TV may turn out to be a Trojan Horse—a deceptively simple gadget that, once in the home, expands its functionality until it takes control of everything. Or it may prove to be the first step toward an Apple-branded television set. Either way, it\\'s no longer just a hobby.APPLE TVThe device ($99) allows users to stream movies, television shows, radio, music, and pictures over a Wi-Fi connection'),\n",

       "  'Working Together:\\nWhy Great Partnerships Succeed\\nBy Michael D. Eisner with Aaron Cohen\\nHarperBusiness, 304 pp, $25.99The first clue that Michael Eisner is irony-deaf appears on the cover of his new book. Above the pious title—Working Together: Why Great Partnerships Succeed—Eisner\\'s name appears in huge letters, leaving scant room for that of his collaborator, Aaron Cohen, in tiny type below. Here\\'s a tip, guys: If you\\'re going to write a book extolling the benefits of partnership, get the optics right. An innocent reader might jump to the conclusion that Eisner\\'s ego is so large it overwhelms everything around it.A well-informed reader might agree. There was, for instance, that $250 million breach-of-contract lawsuit with former protégé Jeffrey Katzenberg, who accused Eisner of bilking him in 1994. Then there was the infatuation with superagent Michael Ovitz, whom Eisner dumped a mere 14 months after hiring him. There was also the dispute with Steve Jobs over Walt Disney\\'s (DIS) distribution deal with Pixar. According to James B. Stewart\\'s definitive account of the Eisner era, Disney War, the author of Working Together referred to those former collaborators, respectively, as \"the little midget,\" a \"psychopath,\" and a \"Shiite Muslim.\" A feud with Roy Disney ultimately resulted in Eisner\\'s departure from the company in 2005.What\\'s a bloodbath, or four, to a Hollywood mogul? For all his bleak history with partners, Eisner was indisputably half of the duo that reinvigorated Disney in the late 1980s. According to Eisner, the decade he spent working alongside Frank Wells—who died in a 1994 helicopter accident—was a wonderful partnership. Inspired by that experience, Eisner interviewed members of other successful working relationships to find out exactly what makes them click, clearly gunning for heartwarming tales of people working side by side, sharing risks and building empires. Yet what he discovers is the messy reality of alpha males and their butting egos, which he attempts to gloss over with all the Mickey Mouse enthusiasm he can muster. As with many of the box-office stinkers Eisner green-lighted after Wells died (Treasure Planet is surely selling in a 99 cents DVD bin near you), this look into partnership badly needed an editor. While Eisner seems genuinely interested in talking up the benefits of working together, he appears blissfully clueless of the ways in which his own anecdotes undermine his thesis.Consider Eisner\\'s account of a key meeting in 1984, when he was the president of Paramount Pictures (VIA). The entertainment lawyer Stanley Gold proposed a deal in which Eisner and Wells, the former president of Warner Bros. (TWX), would become co-chief executive officers of Disney. Eisner rejected the offer on the spot, demanding that he alone be named CEO over the older and more experienced Wells.For reasons known only to him, Wells acquiesced and became Eisner\\'s second-in-command. While some might see this as an example of running from the elephant ego in the room, to Eisner it\\'s the beauty of teamwork. When it comes to complimenting his partner of a decade, Eisner\\'s praise is, shall we say, nuanced. He recounts how, on their first day together at Disney, Wells was under the naive impression they might share the office where Walt himself once worked. Having none of that, Eisner made his desire for privacy perfectly clear, and his No. 2 obediently jumped up and took the office next door.It\\'s at this point—about 10 pages in—that it becomes clear what Eisner extols as partnership is actually something quite different. The book applauds Wells\\' ability to support any idea Eisner threw out and cites a sycophantic, five-page, handwritten note Wells gave the author in 1989 as an example of their compatibility. Writing to both Eisner and his wife, Wells—also speaking on behalf of his own wife—explained his need to \"acknowledge...our feelings about you both and what you\\'ve done for Disney and, derivatively, for our family.\" What prompts an executive to write his \"partner\" such a letter after five years of working together every day? It\\'s a question that Eisner never answers, but it may explain how Wells held on to his job for so long.Of the 10 partnerships Eisner examines, two feature partners who have been dead for more than a decade (Wells and Ian Schrager\\'s former Studio 54 running mate, Steve Rubell). Two more partnerships are defunct because people have retired. One partnership, that of Bill and Melinda Gates, is actually a marriage. Of the five partnerships that qualify as living, breathing business relationships, at least two aren\\'t partnerships in the traditional sense. Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) Vice-Chairman Charlie Munger have swapped thoughts for decades on potential investments, though they don\\'t live in the same city, much less share an office. Same goes for producer Brian Grazer and director Ron Howard. These examples suggest successful partnerships are as much about distance as they are about intimacy, a theme Eisner is perhaps saving for the sequel.The clearest lesson of this book is that the most successful business relationships rely on one partner deliberately subjugating himself or herself, as Munger did with Buffett, as New York Yankees bench coach Don Zimmer did with manager Joe Torre, and, of course, as Wells did with Eisner. The author hints at this sober conclusion but prefers to dwell on sweeter observations that would fit into any Disney log line. Partners, he asserts, must trust one another, keep their egos in check, and share a sense of morality. Eisner slips into the realm of the absurd when he proposes that more successful partnerships might be an antidote to the virus of executive greed that led, he boldly asserts, to the recent financial crisis.For anyone who remembers the hundreds of millions in stock options that Eisner garnered during his tenure at Disney, when he was one of the highest-paid executives in the world, this insight is the most hilarious punch line of all. Particularly, it so happens, as Eisner is said to be a candidate to take over the Tribune Co. If Wells were alive, let\\'s hope he\\'d lean forward and suggest gently to Eisner that he\\'s making a fool of himself. Though all evidence indicates that their beautiful partnership would never have survived if Wells did anything of the kind.'),\n",

       "  '2010-09-16',\n",
       "  'Hollywood is having a hard time deciding if Netflix (NFLX) is friend or foe. The fast-growing movie service has already helped drive DVD retailer Blockbuster (BBI) to the brink of Chapter 11. Now, Netflix is poised to take on premium cable giants like HBO and Showtime. Last month, Netflix bought the rights to stream films from three studios. That will make it the first true Web-based movie channel. It already has 15 million subscribers and an ad-hoc distribution network that includes Web-ready TVs like Sony\\'s (SNE) Bravia, game consoles like Microsoft\\'s (MSFT) Xbox 360, and even gadgets like Apple\\'s (AAPL) iPad. That makes Netflix\\'s $8.99 a month mail-order and online service a threat to more-expensive premium cable channels. It also poses a quandary for HBO parent Time Warner (TWC), whose Warner Bros. studio has become more reliant on Netflix as a source of revenue as overall DVD sales have declined. Netflix \"is a customer for our output, and it is a potential competitor to networks like HBO,\" Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes said last month. \"So far it has been more of a complementary service to HBO than a competitor.\"That\\'s changing. Netflix\\'s most recent deals have moved it from the periphery of the home-entertainment ecosystem into the center of a world in which consumers can watch films and TV shows anytime and anywhere. On Aug. 10 it agreed to pay $900 million for online rights to films from the new Epix pay-TV channel, giving it streaming rights to 3,000 or more films from Viacom\\'s (VIA.B) Paramount Pictures, Lions Gate Entertainment (LGF), and MGM. That raised Netflix\\'s total to more than 20,000 films and TV shows. (It already had rights to some shows from CBS\\' (CBS) Showtime, and movies from Walt Disney (DIS) and Sony via a deal with the Starz pay channel that expires late next year.)Three weeks later, Apple Chief Executive Steve Jobs announced that Apple will use Netflix to stream movies through its Apple TV device as well as the iPhone and iPad. Since then, Netflix\\' shares have jumped 14 percent to about $143 a share. \"The value of Netflix continues to grow,\" BTIG Research analyst Richard Greenfield observed recently. \"Adding a premium TV channel to your cable subscription can cost $10 to $15 a month, in contrast to Netflix for as little as $9 a month.\"Netflix won\\'t instantly remake the cable landscape. It has more than 15 million subscribers; HBO and its sister channel Cinemax together had 41 million U.S. subscribers at the end of 2009. And it\\'s still no snap to stream shows from the Web to the living room TV. But the explosion of Net-ready gear will help. Already, more than 61 percent of Netflix customers have streamed movies, the company says, up from 37 percent a year ago. As its subscriber base grows—Barclays Capital analyst Anthony DiClemente projects membership will jump 43 percent in 2011, to 26.4 million—so too will its clout.Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos says Netflix isn\\'t out to topple the cable incumbents, whose parent companies control the online rights to many of the movies Netflix needs. \"We see ourselves as complementary,\" says Sarandos. \"If someone loves Weeds on Showtime, they\\'ll watch it on Showtime and go find the older episodes from us.\"Still, the pay channels are taking no chances. They\\'re beefing up original programming, like HBO\\'s Boardwalk Empire and Showtime\\'s The Big C, and keeping much of it in-house. For instance, to give its customers first dibs on its shows, Showtime doesn\\'t release episodes of its comedy Weeds to Netflix for streaming until months after they air. Epix requires Netflix to wait 90 days before streaming its new movies and TV shows.HBO, the largest premium cable channel, takes an even harder line: It won\\'t license any of its films or original series, like The Sopranos, for Netflix to stream. HBO also holds the rights for up to eight years to some films from Twentieth Century Fox and Universal Pictures—which could slow Netflix\\'s advance. \"There is value in exclusivity,\" says HBO co-President Eric Kessler. \"Consumers are willing to pay a premium for high quality, exclusive content.\" HBO will battle Netflix on the Internet as well, and by early 2011 expects to make its new HBO Go online service available to its subscribers nationwide. The service, which provides 800 hours of TV shows and movies a month, is available to HBO\\'s subscribers with Comcast (CMCSA) and Verizon\\'s (VZ) FiOS video service.Netflix can counter with 46 percent of the films released last year, says Sarandos, including independent titles like The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. HBO points out that it has seven of last year\\'s 10 best-selling flicks. None of that matters if Sarandos can sign a deal with HBO, which he says he still hopes to do. \"We\\'re buyers and they\\'re sellers,\" he says. \"That\\'s what we do.\"The bottom line: As more home entertainment gear becomes Web-ready, Netflix is poised to become the first true online rival to cable movie channels.'),\n",

       "  '2010-09-09',\n",
       "  'Construction crews are returning to Cascades of Groveland, a gated 55-and-older community west of Orlando, almost three years after its bankrupt developer left residents surrounded by empty lots, partially built homes, and an unfinished clubhouse.Shea Homes, a builder based in Walnut, Calif., bought the remaining 761 lots from Bank of America (BAC) in June and reopened the project on Aug. 25 with a new sales office, lower prices, and a new name: Trilogy. Homeowners, who had taken over the guardhouse for mah-jongg, bingo, and poker games, are looking forward to the opening of the 38,000-square-foot recreational center with indoor and outdoor pools, tennis courts, and a card room. \"For the people here, the activity of construction equipment is music to their ears,\" says Eric Sorkin, 61, president of the homeowners association at the development 35 miles northwest of Disney World. \"There\\'s a future.\"Developments are being resuscitated everywhere from California, Utah, and Las Vegas to the suburbs of Washington, D.C., according to Brad Hunter, chief economist for Metrostudy, a Houston-based housing researcher. \"This is a natural progression of the cycle,\" Hunter says. \"Projects fail; the price of the asset drops until it reaches a point where it\\'s profitable for someone else to pick it up and re-market it.\"Faced with record low demand, builders are trying to boost margins and revenue by pulling unfinished projects out of mothballs. They are buying lots at less than half their original price from lenders eager to move distressed construction loans off their books. They\\'re also benefiting from cheap land and falling construction and labor costs as they try to lure buyers with prices that, in some neighborhoods, are little more than the cost of a foreclosed home.The 12 largest homebuilders by market value added 16,631 lots to their control over their two most recent quarters, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. \"We\\'re buying lots for less than the cost of the improvements,\" says Joe Salisbury, a partner at Candlelight Homes, a homebuilder in South Jordan, Utah. \"If someone offered me raw land for free next door, I wouldn\\'t even want it because it would cost me more to build out the lots.\"Picking up where another builder left off can be complicated by the passing of years. Without attention, weeds grow, swimming pools turn green, government permits expire, and homeowners associations become insolvent, says Taylor B. Grant, founding principal of California Real Estate Receiverships, a consulting firm in Newport Beach, Calif.Yet homebuilders still see advantages to picking up these properties. In the Phoenix metro area alone, work has restarted at about 48 communities, according to Land Advisors Organization in Scottsdale, Ariz. Meritage, which builds in Texas, Nevada, Arizona, California, and Florida, has bought 100 projects with 5,400 finished lots since the first quarter of last year and has restarted work on about half of them, according to Brent Anderson, vice-president for investor relations at the Scottsdale-based company.Toll Brothers (TOL), the largest U.S. luxury homebuilder, paid $23 million to SunTrust Bank (STI) in February for Hasentree, a foreclosed golf course community in Wake Forest, N.C., that was once appraised at $78 million, according to Tom Anhut, Toll Brothers\\' group president in the state. Hasentree was built around a Tom Fazio-designed 18-hole course. At the time of the sale, it had a completed activity center, roads, 100 developed home sites, 218 raw sites, 18 new homes seeking buyers, and 40 occupied houses. Since Hasentree\\'s sales office reopened in July, buyers have put deposits on four new homes, with listing prices starting at $669,995, Anhut says. Hasentree\\'s original homes sold for an average of $1.5 million.It\\'s possible that the revived projects could contribute to a delay in the U.S. housing recovery by adding to the supply of available homes, says Metrostudy\\'s Hunter. At the same time, builders are being cautious about flooding the market by limiting the number of houses they are constructing without having buyers lined up, he says. Whether the projects will overburden the market will become clear in coming quarters, says Jill Lewis, homebuilder specialist for Land Advisors, because many builders purchased lots around the same time, and will likely get ready to market them at about the same time.Residents of Trilogy, who have become close in the years since construction halted, are looking forward to having new neighbors, says Sorkin, the homeowners association president. The clubhouse, which Shea plans to complete in phases over the next two years, will be central Florida\\'s best, Sorkin predicts. \"It will attract many buyers,\" he says. \"And of course, it will be a wonderful retreat for people who live here.\"The bottom line: Bargain prices make it cheaper for homebuilders to acquire unfinished developments and complete them than to build from scratch.'),\n",

       "  '2010-09-01',\n",
       "  'Apple\\'s (AAPL) decade-long run of iPod-, iPhone-, and iPad-fueled prosperity has featured only one notable dud. Introduced in 2006, Apple TV is a set-top box used to play movies and other digital fare on a TV via iTunes on a Mac or PC. Apple has sold fewer than 3 million of them, estimates Kaufman Bros. analyst Shaw Wu. The company sold that many iPads in three months.And yet, at a Sept. 1 event in San Francisco, Steve Jobs announced that Apple is bringing out a less-than-revolutionary upgrade. The new Apple TV looks different—it\\'s black, not white, and at 3.9 inches square, is 75 percent smaller than the old one—and you now rent rather than buy movies and TV shows. (The price has also fallen, from $229 to $99.) Otherwise, its function is mostly unchanged. \"You\\'re still looking at a product for the Apple fanatics,\" says technology marketing consultant David Clarke of BGT Partners.So why bother? Even Jobs concedes the device is mainly for tech hobbyists, and most of the Sept. 1 event was dedicated to the revelation of a new line of iPods and a social networking feature that works within iTunes. What Jobs didn\\'t say is that Apple wants to become king of the living room. He tells Bloomberg Businessweek that when the time is right, Apple could open an App Store for the TV that could do for television sets what all those apps have done for the iPhone. Asked if the iPad could evolve into the TV of tomorrow, Jobs shrugs and says, \"That\\'s how I do most of my TV watching today.\"Still, the timing for such an evolution isn\\'t upon us, Jobs says. Apple\\'s biggest obstacle may be that it doesn\\'t have the rights to sell shows the way it wants. Many studios, nervous about angering the cable companies that pay billions for their content, refused Apple\\'s efforts late last year to put together a subscription service, say three media executives involved in the talks, who requested anonymity because they did not have approval to discuss the negotiations. Consumers would have been able to purchase only those shows they want in an a la carte model, rather than pay for hundreds of channels they never watch.Apple gave up on that idea this past spring, say the executives. Rather than continue to fight a losing battle to replace the cable box, the company refocused on making it iPod-simple to watch shows across all of its devices. With a new software update coming in November, fans of the Fox show Glee, for example, will be able to rent an episode, start watching on their iPhones during the morning commute, watch some more on the PC during lunch, and finish up after work with the iPad or Apple TV.Rather than seek drastic pricing changes from studios, Apple pressed for the right to rent their TV shows for 99¢ per episode, say the executives involved in the discussions. Apple already was selling many movies for $9.99 and TV shows for $1.99 ($2.99 for high-def) on iTunes. The new thinking: A flat 99¢ price per episode—$4.99 for movies—might spark a change in TV watchers\\' behavior, just as it did in music a decade ago. Apple executives, led by Internet services Vice-President Eddy Cue, argued that it could mean billions in incremental sales for the studios as 120 million Apple device owners rent missed episodes to watch on the grocery line or airplane, says one of the executives.Even that proved to be a difficult victory. Studio chiefs are getting hit with new TV schemes from every direction. Netflix (NFLX), Yahoo! (YHOO), and Amazon.com (AMZN) have deals with mobile handset makers, TV set manufacturers, and other hardware companies. Google (GOOG) is coming out with its own offering, which will initially run on Sony (SNE) TVs and Logitech (LOGI) set-top boxes. In the end, only News Corp.\\'s (NWS) 20th Century Fox unit and Walt Disney\\'s (DIS) ABC have agreed to provide shows for Apple to rent. In News Corp.\\'s case, the agreement is for a trial period. (Jobs is Disney\\'s largest shareholder and sits on the company\\'s board.)If Hollywood isn\\'t ready to distribute TV as Jobs would like it, Apple is still well positioned to pull off an a la carte model in the future. All of its devices function easily together, tied by software that no other consumer technology company has been able to match for utility and style. \"Today\\'s announcements were just a stepping stone,\" says Michael Gartenberg, a partner at consulting firm Altimeter Group. \"TV is too important for Apple to ignore.\" If Apple keeps growing the way it has, it may be too big for the media giants to ignore: Apple has 160 million credit-card numbers on file thanks to iTunes, while Comcast (CMCSA) has 23 million.A big question will be whether Apple opens an App Store for Apple TV. If it does that, and history repeats itself, thousands of developers might then race to create programs suited to the TV. Tim Westergren, chief executive officer of the streaming music service Pandora, is already dreaming of the possibilities for his business. \"When I was a kid, I used to stare at album covers for hours,\" he says. \"This could be a big, interactive album cover.\"None of this will come cheap for Apple. The company is putting the finishing touches on a $1 billion, 500,000-square-foot data center set off a two-lane road in rural Maiden, N.C., population 3,200. If you stand by the cemetery behind Cedar Grove Baptist Church, you can get a pretty good look at the site through the trees. Code-named Project Dolphin by local officials, Apple\\'s facility could be used for storing your iTunes music and video, or to take on Facebook in a bigger way. Apple isn\\'t saying. Whatever the company is cooking up, it\\'ll be big, says David J. Cappuccio, an analyst with Gartner (IT): \"Any company that is investing a billion dollars must have some serious plans.\"The bottom line: The Apple TV update won\\'t wow consumers, but it\\'s a long-term bet on Apple\\'s place in the living room.'),\n",

       "  'Best Buy (BBY) is a big seller of wireless gadgets like laptops and mobile phones. Now it wants to sell the services they communicate over, too. In late July the nation\\'s leading consumer electronics retailer said it would begin reselling Clearwire\\'s (CLWR) 4G mobile broadband service under its own brand, Best Buy Connect, starting in 2011.Dozens of companies have tried unsuccessfully to build a business providing wireless voice and Web access over networks leased from others. ESPN Mobile, Disney Mobile, and Amp\\'d Mobile are among the ventures that failed in a field known for its high setup and marketing costs and paper-thin margins. \"It\\'s been a disaster,\" says John Strand, CEO of Strand Consult in Denmark. These so-called mobile virtual network operators (MVNO) look like traditional wireless carriers to customers but don\\'t own or maintain their own networks.Best Buy thinks it can succeed where so many others haven\\'t because it won\\'t have to spend heavily on the setup and marketing costs that tripped up other players. The $49.7 billion retailer already has call centers to handle customer service inquiries. Distribution? Best Buy will sell mobile plans in 1,017 of its 1,089 stores in the U.S. and market them in the millions of local newspaper inserts that it already produces to advertise its consumer electronics gear nationwide. One of the additional costs, the retailer says, will be sending its new broadband customers a monthly service bill. \"The economics of this business model are very solid,\" explains Jed Stillman, Best Buy Connect\\'s vice-president for business development. \"The distribution aspect that\\'s been costly and difficult for others is not there.\"Best Buy says it hopes to turn a profit with Best Buy Connect. It also has a strategic reason for launching the service: It wants to become a one-stop shopping locale as the market for mobile broadband devices takes off. The company already says it sells one in three PCs in the U.S. ABI Research expects the number of wireless-enabled electronic devices—not including phones and laptops—will double, to 5 million, in 2011. That includes e-book readers, Internet-ready televisions, and car navigation units. In early August, Best Buy\\'s chief technology officer Twittered that the company was investigating its own tablet computer. \"We are just at the tip of the iceberg,\" says Michael Antieri, president of AT&T\\'s (T) unit promoting wider use of wireless-enabled devices. \"There [eventually] could be hundreds of billions of machines, sensors, [and] devices wirelessly enabled.\"In its stores, Best Buy already sells wireless broadband service offered by Verizon Wireless, Sprint Nextel (S), and AT&T. So with the rollout of Best Buy Connect, the retailer is set to compete with those partners. AT&T declined to comment. Sprint spokesman Scott Sloat says \"partners like Best Buy have access to additional channels that can reach customer segments that Sprint may not be reaching.\" Best Buy recently began reselling Sprint\\'s 3G service under its own brand. Shaw Wu, an analyst at Kaufman Bros., says there are mutual benefits for telecom operators: \"They need Best Buy, and vice versa.\"The retailer says Best Buy Connect\\'s edge will be its ability to provide customers with one-stop shopping for a wide range of wireless devices, broadband, and customer service. \"Best Buy Connect is going to be right for some people and not right for others,\" Stillman says. \"At the end of the day, they\\'ll choose.\"The bottom line: Eager to position itself for growth in the sale of wireless-enabled devices, Best Buy is starting its own mobile broadband service.'),\n",

Disney created a family-oriented mobile service that included a global positioning system so parents could track their kids. Too few consumers signed up, and the company killed the operation after 15 months. Disney Interactive, the division that ran the ill-fated cell service, is still unprofitable. It lost $55 million last quarter.Iger retains his enthusiasm for digital business and has switched strategies to buying rather than building. He wants to acquire social games and other online services that come with established customers and talented creators—and can help sell Disney\\'s famous brands. \"You don\\'t get the kind of growth we want by building from the inside,\" he says.Since paying $350 million for the kids\\' social network Club Penguin three years ago, Disney has purchased Wideload Games, whose founder helped create Microsoft\\'s (MSFT) hit Halo franchise. Early last month, the entertainment giant acquired Tapulous, a publisher of music-related games for Apple\\'s (AAPL) iPhone. On July 27, Disney made its biggest video game bet yet, agreeing to pay $563 million for privately held Playdom, the Mountain View (Calif.) maker of Sorority Life and Mobsters, which are played on Facebook, MySpace, and mobile phones. If Playdom meets performance targets over time, its founders and investors may receive an additional $200 million.Playdom specializes in games that sell virtual goods. In Mobsters, players try to build crime syndicates by buying—with real money—digital machine guns and henchmen. In Sorority Life, players buy clothing andaccessories as they climb a social ladder. Some 42 million people regularly play Playdom\\'s games each month, according to Disney. Analyst Michael Pachter of Wedbush Morgan Securities says the purchase of Playdom will give Disney a potentially fast-growing venue to sell every Disney character and media brand from Mickey Mouse to Spider-Man to ESPN.For example, when Disney releases the Pixar movie Cars 2 next June, it could promote the film by using its soundtrack in a Tapulous-made music game for mobile phones and weaving Cars 2 characters into Playdom games on Facebook. Disney plans to launch a virtual world based on Cars this month. That would be in addition to more traditional product tie-ins—plush-toy merchandise, games for Nintendo\\'s Wii console, coverage on ABC and the Disney Channel, and theme park rides.\"I don\\'t think they\\'re looking for Playdom\\'s revenues as much as they\\'re looking for Playdom\\'s knowhow\" in working social games into the Disney mix, Pachter says. Playdom CEO John Pleasants is moving to Disney, where he will continue to oversee social game development and become an executive vice-president. He\\'ll be working with Iger\\'s point man for digital strategy, Steve Wadsworth, who has run Disney\\'s Internet unit since 1999 and assumed video game oversight in 2008.Iger says the buy-don\\'t-build approach is what drove some earlier acquisitions. His $8.1 billion purchase of Pixar in 2006, for example, buttressed Disney\\'s flagging animation division; the $4.2 billion acquisition of Marvel Entertainment last year gave the company iconic comic-book characters that appeal to boys. (Disney had been known more for cartoon princesses than superheroes.) Club Penguin was the company\\'s first acquisition of a virtual world. The site\\'s founders are busy running online worlds with monthly subscription fees and sales of virtual goods; they built the Cars site that will launch this month and are overseeing older ones like Pirates of the Caribbean Online.Iger has some Internet talent on his board to lean on as he makes digital deals. Apple CEO Steve Jobs joined as a result of the Pixar acquisition and is Disney\\'s largest shareholder. Disney was the first to sell TV shows and films on Apple\\'s iTunes online media store. In March, Iger tapped Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg to become a director. Since then Disney has increased its presence on the social network and experimented with using it to sell tickets to the Pixar movie Toy Story 3.It\\'s been typical for big media companies to lose money online. News Corp.\\'s (NWS) digital media unit lost $150 million in the quarter ended in March. CBS (CBS) stopped breaking out results for interactive after that unit lost $41.3 million during the first nine months of 2009.Could Disney\\'s acquisitions put it on track to make some money online? \"It\\'s the right strategy for Disney to buy,\" says Gina Bianchini, a venture capitalist who co-founded the social network Ning.com with Marc Andreessen. \"And they are looking at some very savvy acquisitions.\"The bottom line: Disney\\'s Iger attempts to buy his way to digital success with the purchase of game maker Playdom.'),\n",

       "  '2010-07-22',\n",
       "  'Money managers tout their investing strategy in books, at seminars, and on blogs. Some call it a science, others an art form. And then, of course, there\\'s luck. In that spirit, here\\'s one more stockpicking technique to add to the list: Take a look at who is lunching at the White House.Since becoming President, Barack Obama has held seven lunches with small groups of chairmen and chief executive officers, including Jeff Bezos of Amazon.com (AMZN), Ken Chenault of American Express (AXP), Ursula Burns of Xerox (XRX), and Howard Schultz of Starbucks (SBUX). In four of the lunches, the guests\\' companies, as a group, outperformed the Standard & Poor\\'s 500-stock index 30 trading days after the repast. In two cases, the groups\\' shares underperformed the S&P 500 a month after lunch with the Commander-in-Chief. Altogether, the six lunch groups outdid the S&P by more than two percentage points. Thirty days haven\\'t elapsed since a seventh lunch held on July 1.Just a coincidence? Only partly, says Barry Ritholtz, CEO of equity research firm Fusion IQ. Losers don\\'t get asked to hang out with the President, he says. The White House likely is putting together invitation lists so that the President is dining with executives at the top of their games and not associating with companies in decline or under investigation. \"If the captain of your team gets a phone call from the White House, it probably means your team is about to win the World Series or already has won,\" Ritholtz says. Adds Andrew Rudd, CEO of Advisor Software: \"Obama is trying to associate himself with winners and it\\'s sort of potentially reinforcing.\"Of course, not every one of the 33 publicly traded companies\\' share prices rose. Eastman Kodak fell 8.4 percent in the 30 trading days after Chief Executive Antonio Perez dined with Obama on Oct. 8, 2009. (The company reported its fourth-straight quarterly loss later that month.) On the plus side, Amazon shares rose 40 percent after Bezos attended the Oct. 8 lunch.Rudd, whose Lafayette (Calif.) company provides analytical tools to wealth managers, cautions against building an investment strategy around the President\\'s guest lists. The sample size is too small, Rudd says, and the shares\\' outperformance is probably a statistical anomaly. Still, he says: \"I\\'m sure people will bet on this, just as certain people pick companies with stock prices at 9.99 or the same names as their aunts.\"The President\\'s stockpicking magic is still working. On July 1 he lunched on a patio outside the Oval Office with the heads of Walt Disney (DIS), Ford Motor (F), Comcast (CMCSA), and Archer Daniels Midland (ADM). Thirteen trading days later, as of July 20, their companies\\' shares had risen an average of 9.3 percent vs. 4.8 percent for the S&P.The bottom line: President Obama\\'s choice of corporate executive lunch guests shows he\\'s pretty good at picking winners.'),\n",

       "  'On June 30 the Homeland Security Dept.\\'s U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement arm used a vacant sound stage at Walt Disney Studios (DIS) in Burbank, Calif., to announce the seizure of nine websites with names like NinjaVideo.net and thepiratecity.org that allegedly traffic in illegal movie downloads. The operation, which involved 100 special agents, follows a separate move by the Federal Communications Commission in May that opened the way for studios to offer cable viewers films at premium prices while the flicks are still playing in theaters.Hollywood may also get a big win in the pending financial reform legislation expected to pass later this summer that will reshape the regulation of derivatives. Tucked into the current version of the bill is a ban of futures markets in box-office ticket sales such as one planned by securities brokerage firm Cantor Fitzgerald. Hollywood fears such a market would harm the financial fortunes of some films.\"We feel like we\\'ve got the wind at our back,\" says Warner Bros. (TWX) Chairman Barry Meyer, one of Hollywood\\'s advocates of tougher actions on piracy. \"We\\'re getting a good hearing on the issues that matter to us.\"All this is a change from the last Bush Administration, which focused on concerns over indecent television programming and resisted efforts by cable TV operators to raise prices. Such issues haven\\'t been a priority for FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski, a Harvard Law School classmate of Obama\\'s, who until 2005 served as general counsel for IAC (IACI), an Internet company headed by former Hollywood executive Barry Diller.Hollywood\\'s biggest win so far has been on movie piracy. Studio executives lobbied the Administration during a meeting in December with Vice-President Joseph Biden to step up its efforts, says A. Robert Pisano, acting chief executive of the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA). The lobbying group, which had pressed Washington for the last decade to crack down on piracy, says it costs the economy $20 billion a year. Federal officials say they will continue closing down offending websites.Major movie studios and the industry\\'s lobbying group have been generous Democratic Party campaign contributors. The motion picture industry gave $14.1 million to federal candidates for the 2008 election, with 90 percent of that going to Democrats, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. \"A lot of Hollywood types and companies came out pretty strongly for Obama\" during the Democratic primaries in 2008, says Andrew D. Lipman, a Washington-based media lawyer with the firm Bingham McCutchen.Hollywood still has big policy priorities on its agenda. Major movie studios were disappointed by a federal court decision on June 24 that sided with Google (GOOG) in a lawsuit filed by Viacom alleging that Google\\'s video-sharing website, YouTube, didn\\'t act quickly enough to take down copyright-infringing content. Viacom wants new federal rules put in place that would require online service providers to tell offending customers to \"stop or your bandwidth will be shut down or throttled,\" says Scott Martin, executive vice-president of intellectual property at Paramount Pictures, a Viacom unit. Service providers such as AT&T say they currently need a court order to take that action.Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) says he\\'s trying to build support for even tougher legislation and enforcement. And why not? Hollywood has been good to Leahy, who had a small role in the 2008 Batman movie, The Dark Knight.The bottom line: In contrast to the last Bush White House, the Obama Administration has been responsive to Hollywood\\'s policy agenda.'),\n",
       " ('Sony Seeks Relevance in an Apple-Centric Age',\n",
       "  '2010-07-01',\n",
       "  'Sony (SNE) once set the standard for inventing products people never knew they wanted—from the Walkman to the CD player to game consoles. That knack for shaping consumer tastes powered the Japanese company\\'s market share and ability to command premium prices for its gear. If that sounds a lot like the recent history of Apple (AAPL), that\\'s a big part of Sony Chief Executive Sir Howard Stringer\\'s current challenge.So how can Sony set itself apart in an Apple world? Stringer is taking a page from the iPod maker\\'s playbook: He wants to digitally funnel Sony\\'s trove of music, movie, and gaming content directly to its TVs and other devices. Key will be Sony\\'s PlayStation 3 game console and its wireless Blu-ray players, which Stringer is pushing as media hubs that (like Apple\\'s iPhone and its Apps store) can link audiences to content without a computer.Stringer\\'s strategy faces challenges, as shown on June 29 when Hulu, the video website run by NBC Universal, News Corp.\\'s (NWS) Fox, and Disney\\'s (DIS) ABC, unveiled its much-anticipated subscription service to push TV shows to consumer devices. Hulu Plus will be available exclusively for hardware made by Apple and Samsung at its debut. Sony wanted to be part of the initial deal, and will now have to wait until fall to get in on the action. It\\'s a setback because Sony is eager to use content deals to spur sales of its gear. \"That\\'s the experience you need to drive Sony into the digital future,\" Stringer said before the Hulu decision.Stringer\\'s predecessor, Nobuyuki Idei, tried to marry content and hardware and was thwarted by warring factions within the company. The recession gave Stringer an opportunity to upend the status quo. Besides firing 19,500 people and outsourcing much of Sony\\'s TV manufacturing, he replaced long-serving division chiefs with younger, more collegial managers. \"There are still silos at Sony,\" says Richard Doherty, who runs the market research firm Envisioneering. \"But now at least they\\'re sending smoke signals to one another.\"Stringer says he chose his team—dubbed the Four Musketeers—because he deemed them less likely than their predecessors to use the \"past as a blueprint.\" The Musketeer to watch is Kaz Hirai, 50, who worked at Sony Music and helped popularize the PlayStation. Hirai now runs the Networked Products & Services Group. Before his ascension, the TV, game, and movie units each had their own way of delivering Web content. Hirai has got them working together, Stringer says, and made it possible for consumers to use one account to access movies, shows, and Webisodes on any Sony device—much as Apple does with iTunes.Stringer hopes to use the PlayStation Network as a model for the entire company. That four-year-old service has 50 million registered users who can buy or rent video, games, and music over the Web. Stringer aims to sell 350 million networked gadgets and generate $3.4 billion from network services, which include movies and games, by Mar. 31, 2013. No one doubts networked gadgets are the future, and everyone is pursuing them. \"People like their stuff to work together,\" says Jeff Barney, who oversees digital products at Toshiba. \"That\\'s where Apple has challenged us.\" Sony also faces Microsoft (MSFT), which has similar hopes for its Xbox 360 game console.Stringer\\'s competitive advantage may lie in 3D, a technology Sony is spending $100 million to promote, according to U.S. marketing chief Mike Fasulo. Again, Stringer hopes to spur sales of 3D TVs and DVRs with a rush of content—from a Wheel of Fortune game to World Cup coverage shot in 3D. \"A television without content is like a refrigerator without food or a car without gasoline,\" Sony Pictures chief Michael Lynton said during a June presentation.Doherty sees Sony ahead of Panasonic (PC) and Samsung in 3D: \"Sony is in the catbird seat as far as having the most Blu-ray players out there [and] they have the only game console that can be upgraded to 3D.\" Still, recession-squeezed consumers may not be ready to spend $3,900 for a Sony 46-inch 3D set. So Stringer may have a hard time hitting his target of $11.3 billion in 3D-related sales by mid-2013, analysts say.In fiscal 2009 and 2010, Sony lost a combined $1.4 billion. In May, however, the company said it would earn $540 million this year, a sign the cost-cutting has stabilized its financial position. Now Stringer has to prove that the long-promised synergies of his businesses can be realized.The bottom line: Sony is increasingly being eclipsed in consumer electronics by Apple. So it\\'s pushing its content over networked devices to fight back.'),\n",

When he did, The Lion King was the No. 1 movie in America, Beauty and the Beast was a blockbuster on Broadway, and Home Improvement was the No. 1 show on television. Being fired in failure hurts. Being fired in success is downright humiliating. The most difficult decision in my career was made for me, instead of by me.Disney (DIS) put out a press release. When I got back to my office an hour later, I got three calls. The first was from Bill Gates. The second was from Tom Murphy, CEO of CapCities/ABC. The third was from Steven Spielberg and Bob Zemeckis, who were vacationing together in Jamaica. They called to congratulate me on getting fired. They thought it was hilarious.I didn't see it coming. I felt as though I had given them the 10 best years of my ability to that point. I had had an 18-year partnership with Michael. We had shared a lot of triumphs and successes. I felt hurt that he chose not to continue the relationship.Nobody likes to sue, but I had to. Numerous people tried to mediate this, but every single time, in every single way, it fell apart. What Michael had done to me was immoral, unethical. This was somebody who, out of anger, was trying to cheat me out of a black-and-white contract. I spent four years trying to get back what was mine at a cost of tens of millions of dollars. Everybody loses in some way when you find yourself in court.I encourage people to make decisions as quickly as possible, to keep momentum; procrastinating causes a different set of problems. I tend to move on and not look back. But I can see now that the writing was on the wall at Disney. The way I was behaving was causing a level of friction I was unaware of. I wasn't thinking about my impact.Even though I was angry, I walked off that studio lot with optimism.

       "  '2010-06-24',\n",
       "  'In the fast-moving world of mobile devices there are many battles brewing. The one to watch may be the standoff between Adobe (ADBE) Chief Executive Officer Shantanu Narayen and Apple (AAPL) CEO Steve Jobs over Flash, the Adobe software that brings interactivity to millions of websites.\"Flash looks like a technology that has had its day,\" Jobs said at a tech conference earlier this month. In his view, Flash is a bug-ridden battery hog. He favors HTML5, a still-evolving Web technology that does many of the same things as Flash.In an interview at Adobe\\'s headquarters in San Jose, Calif., Narayen comes across as soft-spoken and measured—not the kind of guy to do battle over competing Web standards. Ask him if the dispute over Flash amounts to a \"war,\" as Jobs has called it, and he smiles. \"The words to describe it are irrelevant,\" Narayen says. \"To us, this is about where computing is headed.\"The Flash Player software, which is free, powers most of the Web\\'s intro screens, video shorts, inserted commercials, dancing typography, and interactive graphics and is installed on 98 percent of personal computers worldwide. It\\'s used by about 85 percent of the top 100 websites, delivering 70 percent of Web games and 75 percent of Web video, Adobe says. By the company\\'s count, 19 of the top 20 mobile handset makers are committed to building smartphones that support Flash. The lone holdout is Apple and its iPhone and iPad.Narayen, an Apple employee from 1989 to 1995, says Jobs\\' gripes about Flash have less to do with the technology itself than the Apple chairman\\'s desire to dominate the future of mobile. \"Whenever there\\'s disruption that happens in computing, there are wars that happen that enable people to get disproportionate market share,\" says Narayen. \"You saw that in the PC era when whoever controlled the applications was able to get dominant market share. Apple is looking at Flash and saying that it keeps them from being able to have the kind of closed system that they would like.\" Apple did not return calls for comment. Unlike Flash, HTML5 is a nonproprietary technology. No single company owns it.Adobe is banking on a new version of its player, called Flash 10.1, to prove to the market that it continues to be relevant in the world of smartphones and tablet computers. Although the new software was in the works before Jobs went public with his criticisms, it does address a number of his complaints. Flash 10.1 is designed to make video run more smoothly on mobile devices, while also supporting iPhone-like touchscreen gestures such as pinching fingers to shrink a photo, or widening them to zoom in. Adobe says the new application is also better at conserving battery power.The Flash Player itself contributes little to Adobe\\'s bottom line; the company makes money selling tools to software programmers who build on the technology. The real revenue generator for the company is the Adobe Creative Suite, a collection of graphic design, video editing, and Web development applications that use Flash technology. On June 22, Adobe posted record revenue of $943 million for the second quarter, representing 34 percent year-over-year growth, which the company attributed to strong demand for the latest version of Creative Suite.Adobe\\'s goal in coming months is to get Flash up and running on as many new mobile devices as possible. Nokia (NOK), Research In Motion (RIMM), and Palm (recently bought by Hewlett-Packard (HPQ)) will be using Flash on soon-to-arrive mobile phones. The Dell (DELL) Streak, a 5-inch tablet that uses Flash and Google\\'s Android operating system, was introduced in the U.K. earlier this month and will hit shelves in the U.S. later this summer. Motorola\\'s (MOT) new Droid 2 phone, set for launch on June 23, the day before the official release of the iPhone 4, also is expected to use Adobe\\'s technology.Adobe isn\\'t betting that HTML5 goes away. Rather, the company believes it will develop over the years as a technology complementary to Flash, and is creating tools that will work with both. \"Ideally, I\\'d love to see a ubiquitous platform across all devices,\" says Steve Jackson, president and CEO of Smashing Ideas, a Seattle-based digital media studio that produces content for the Cartoon Network, Disney Channel, Nickelodeon, and other companies. \"But we\\'ve been hoping for that for a decade. We\\'re going to continue to create content across multiple platforms, and that certainly includes both Flash and the iPhone.\"Google (GOOG), which has been waging its own battles with Apple, is emerging as an important ally to Adobe. Flash will be part of the recently announced Google TV, which aims to put Web content on Sony (SNE)-manufactured TV sets powered by Google\\'s Android. Sometime in the coming months, Google is expected to release its own tablet computer that will also support Flash.\"We expect Flash to be part of all of the devices that count,\" says Narayen. \"I think it\\'s going to be an incredible holiday season.\"The bottom line: Adobe is getting its Flash software on many smartphones, even though Steve Jobs is knocking it.'),\n",

When the 25-year-old aspiring \"global icon\" becomes a free agent on July 1, his price will be fixed. The rules worked out by the National Basketball Assn. owners and players union dictate that as a seven-year veteran, James can\\'t receive more than 30 percent of a team\\'s salary cap, which is projected to be $56.1 million next year. The Cleveland Cavaliers, his current employer and hometown team, can offer a six-year contract while the competition can offer only five, but regardless of where he signs, James will have to survive on an average of about $20 million a year.James is quite a bit more valuable than that. The Cavaliers had the NBA\\'s best regular-season record this year; should James sign elsewhere, they will immediately sink to the middle of the league pack, if not lower. The psychic blow—to the team, the city, the entire Rust Belt—would be even greater. The pressure to persuade James to stay is enormous.

His voice trailed off at the end of sentences, and he laughed feebly at his own jokes. \"We have to ignore the noise,\" he said flatly. \"We are focused on building the best franchise, the best environment, the best place for a long-term situation for LeBron or any free agent that we want to come here.\"Gilbert bought the Cavaliers for $375 million in 2005, halfway through James\\'s second year with the team. He has been adamant that he won\\'t beg or grovel for James to stay—and that\\'s a logical negotiating stance. Doing so would acknowledge that the value of his investment rides on the whims of a single employee who is half his age. Guess what? It does anyway. When James joined the team, home attendance at Cavaliers games went up 59 percent. This season, the team sold out all 41 home games for the first time in franchise history, and the Cavaliers were shown on national television as often as the Lakers and Celtics. Gilbert may own the Cavaliers, but James owns Gilbert.In a 2009 study titled \"Should Investors Bet on the Jockey or the Horse?\" in The Journal of Finance, Steven Kaplan, an expert on executive compensation at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, found that the answer, generally, is the horse. \"In most businesses, what you find is that the core attribute is not the people, it\\'s the business,\" he says. \"Warren Buffett has a famous saying, which I think is supported by the data: \\'When a management with a reputation for brilliance tackles a business with a reputation for bad economics, it is usually the reputation of the business that remains intact.\\'\"Kaplan\\'s analysis presumes that value is sprinkled somewhat evenly across an organization. LeBron-style problems emerge when one entity is disporportionately responsible for value-creation. Sports franchises are obvious examples, though hardly the only ones.The economics of the legal profession is also skewed by larger-than-life talent that demands larger-than-life compensation. Twenty years ago, at the law firm Kirkland & Ellis, Fred Bartlit Jr. was LeBron James in pinstripes. Bartlit, now best known for representing George W. Bush in Gore v. Bush in 2000, had distinguished himself as a powerful trial lawyer who attracted big clients. The compensation structure at Kirkland, as at most large firms, however, was based primarily on seniority and hours billed. Frustrated by the difference between his perceived value and his paycheck, Bartlit persuaded Kirkland to adopt a pay-by-results system for him and his group. \"I originally thought that the model of getting paid for the value you bring could co-exist within an hourly firm,\" Bartlit says. But the two systems didn\\'t work together. As a result, Bartlit left Kirkland in 1993 and founded Bartlit Beck Herman Palenchar & Scott.Bartlit, whose Chicago office uses a two-story basketball court as a conference room, sees the parallels between big-time trial lawyers and big-time basketball players. \"I bet there are fewer lawyers who actually try billion-dollar, bet-your-company cases to verdict with consistency than there are big-ticket basketball players,\" he says. \"When we go for interviews on these big cases, we often see the same four or five lawyers. I had one on the West Coast recently, and in the lobby of the hotel as we were getting ready, I saw David Boies [his opponent in Gore v. Bush].\"Boies, adds Bartlit, is another star who could not get what he perceived to be fair value for his services within the culture of an established firm. (Boies famously left Cravath, Swaine & Moore in 1997 to start Boies, Schiller & Flexner.) For Bartlit, this is the natural way of things: Talented lawyers with an appetite for risk eventually feel undervalued enough to strike out on their own.James doesn\\'t have the option of leaving the Cavaliers for his own firm. While he might one day find himself with the means to buy a team, for now he\\'s restricted to working for the cartel of 30 NBA owners in the much the same way that movie stars are stuck negotiating with the so-called Big Six studios (Warner Bros. (TWX), Fox (NWS), Paramount (VIA), Sony (SNE), Disney (DIS), and NBC Universal). But where NBA owners formally band together under the auspices of a commissioner to protect themselves from the foolish and free-spending among them, studio heads simply keep a common discipline against prodigal spending.Still, LeBron problems can emerge when movie stars gain leverage from associations with a hit franchise, as Tobey Maguire did after the original installment of Spider-Man. After receiving $4 million to star in a movie that grossed $820 million worldwide, Maguire renegotiated his deal to get $17 million for the sequel and $15 million, plus a heavy cut of the gross, for the third. But when the director Sam Raimi balked at a budget for the fourth installment that he considered too low, the studio delayed production and dumped Raimi, Maguire, and his co-star Kirsten Dunst. In an industry where only the most ardent viewers can discern a Ryan Gosling from a Ryan Reynolds, such things are possible, albeit risky. Spider-Man 4 is in limbo, and replacement stars in franchise movies can tank. See Dumb and Dumberer. Better yet, don\\'t.If there\\'s a common strategy among successful managers with LeBron problems, it\\'s to stop negotiating and start seducing: What does LeBron James need that money can\\'t buy? \"A world-class athlete is fundamentally no different than a world-class scientist,\" says Michael M. Crow, the president of Arizona State University. \"They are interested in finding a way to express everything that they have without limit so that they can gain recognition.\" President E. Gordon Gee of Ohio State University likens himself to an \"institutional psychiatrist,\" someone who recruits people who would be successful anywhere but require the constant reassurance that their institution believes in them. Reassurance can be time-consuming, and it requires adjustments in organizational culture. On the other hand, it\\'s also free.Best-selling novelist James Patterson dominates the publishing industry in much the same way James does the NBA. Some titles sell better than his, but no author can compete on volume. Last year Patterson sold 14 million copies while publishing nine new books. He holds the all-time record with more than 50 New York Times best sellers to his name. Patterson is well compensated—Forbes valued his current 17-book deal at $150 million—and money is not terribly important to him. \"I\\'m not particularly interested in squeezing every penny out that I possibly could,\" he says. Instead, Patterson wants a commitment from his publisher to work hard and make a big deal of everything he does.Movie studios, naturally, are expert at this kind of pampering. \"Tom Cruise has a caterer he\\'s been using since the movie The Firm,\" says Edward Jay Epstein, author of The Hollywood Economist and expert witness in film contract disputes. \"If he complains he has a stomachache, you\\'re delaying the movie at a cost of $300,000 a day, so you\\'re not going to screw around with the caterer. Makeup, trainers, security, all that, the star will get.\" Studios will go so far as to give bit parts to the members of a star\\'s entourage. \"The point of these people is to make the star happy and make the movie work, it\\'s not really a negotiation as much as an accommodation,\" says Epstein.Bartlit says he keeps the partners at his firm happy not just by paying them well, but also by giving them the chance to do what they most love to do—fight in court. \"People get in court all the time,\" he says. \"I think something like 94 percent of our lawyers took a witness to the trial last year.\" He believes the same holds for players like James; the money has to be there, but the real gratification is in offering them a chance to compete and win.Dan Gilbert has tried seduction. Three years ago, the Cavaliers opened a $25 million, 50,000-square-foot, state-of-the-art practice facility, which just happened to be convenient to James\\'s 33,000 sq.-ft. home in Summit County. Since the season ended, both the team\\'s general manager and coach have left, fueling speculation, denied by Gilbert, that the moves were made at James\\'s behest.The Cavaliers and their fans have been shameless—and shrewd—in selling James on the sentimental appeal of staying home. A billboard near the Cavaliers\\' Quicken Loans Arena hopefully declares, \"Born Here. Raised Here. Plays Here. Stays Here.\" Both President Barack Obama and NBA Commissioner David J. Stern have noted the appeal of James re-signing with Cleveland.Yet when money is equal and emotional appeals have been exhausted, it comes down to winning, a currency of its own, and one that James has said he is most passionate about. Outside of professional sports, few things are as unambiguously precious as a championship. Here, Cleveland is at a distinct disadvantage; of all the teams in the NBA, only the Cavaliers have proven they can\\'t win it all with James—seven years, no titles. Chicago has the most talented supporting cast and can offer James his best chance at an immediate trophy. New York owns the greatest story line—a marquee franchise starved for a hero—and the city itself promises to make winners of anyone who moves there. On paper, Gilbert and the Cavaliers can\\'t win, yet they clearly can\\'t afford to lose. The reason they\\'re so vulnerable is the same reason they have a shot—because it all comes down to one guy. The only thing worse than a LeBron problem is no LeBron.'),\n",

       "  'The UPS truck rumbles down Main Street in Toledo most mornings, past the boarded-up Cloud 9 bar, the abandoned Masonic Temple, the car wash, the tattoo parlor, and the payday loan shop. It stops at the small warehouse of BCP Imports (Brainchild Products), where a dozen young men, recently hired and plenty eager, rush to unload, sort, and repackage hundreds of boxes of Silly Bandz. They are this year\\'s kiddie rage—brightly colored silicone bands shaped like the outlines of animals, letters, princesses, and more. Kids, and a few notable parents such as Sarah Jessica Parker, stretch them out to wear like bracelets. When taken off they revert to their original shapes. Kids also trade them, count them, and fling them, which is why they\\'ve been banned in some schools around the country. A pack of 24 costs about $5. Robert J. Croak, the 47-year-old founder of BCP, says he has sold millions.Croak is sitting behind a desk covered with piles of paper and four computer screens, halfway through a bottle of chocolate Yoo-hoo. He\\'s wound up and blustery, his voice raspy from late nights in the office. Croak has been a bar owner and concert promoter in Toledo\\'s gritty east side for years. He grew up in the neighborhood, earned a degree in marketing from Owens Community College, then took over his grandmother\\'s Main Street restaurant after she died and turned it into a rock club called Frankie\\'s Inner-City lounge. For the past several years he has been selling custom t-shirts, dog tags, mugs, and silicone bracelets made popular by Lance Armstrong. Nothing in his background suggested that he would find himself at the center of one of the biggest successes in modern-day toy selling; Croak is an opportunist who has found the greatest opportunity of his life. \"I\\'m the luckiest guy alive right now. I don\\'t think you\\'re going to find anyone who has a reason to be happier than I am,\" he says. \"I have the hottest toy, the hottest fashion product on earth. All the right people like Silly Bandz. Everyone asks who my publicist is. I don\\'t have one. We don\\'t advertise. All we do is viral marketing. This is happening on its own.\"It might also end on its own, its energy exhausted, once kids\\' attention turns elsewhere. \"This isn\\'t a cultural phenomenon, it\\'s a schoolyard fad,\" says Christopher Byrne, an independent toy consultant. \"It\\'s tracking the way a lot of fads do. The product is out there for awhile, it hits critical mass, then kids get tired of it.\" On the fad hierarchy, Silly Bandz might have reached the level of Kooky Klickers and scented erasers, but it has a long way to go before achieving the status of Beanie Babies. The products are also easier than most to copy—already, cheaper-looking imitations are widely available. Croak says he\\'s not concerned about any of this, although he is trying to establish Silly Bandz as a brand that resonates beyond the bands themselves; after all, they have no logos, no characters, no stories. \"We\\'ve been planning some new products that will make Silly Bandz a household name for the next 5 to 10 years,\" he says. As with many aspects of his company, he declines to get into specifics. \"I\\'d love to share some details, but I can\\'t.\"About three years ago, Croak and the manager of the factory that produces his silicone bracelets visited a trade show in China, where the manager spotted stretchy animal shapes that were sold in Japan as rubber bands. \"I liked the way they looked, and I thought if they were done correctly—larger and thicker—they would make a great fashion accessory,\" says Croak. \"It\\'s like any entrepreneur: If you see something you like and have the capability to develop it differently, then the sky\\'s the limit. You know the Dyson vacuum guy who says in his commercial that he had 180 prototypes before he got it right? With Silly Bandz, we got it right the first time.\"The animal bands were hardly new. The Japanese creators had been recognized with a national design award and had been selling them in America in a limited capacity since 2002. The Museum of Modern Art Design Store carried them, as did the Japanese department store Takashimaya. New York magazine singled the animal bands out in October of that year, noting that they could be worn as bracelets. But what Croak saw in China \"wasn\\'t Silly Bandz,\" he says. \"We trademarked the name. We created them. We created the craze.\"Croak saw potential in the bands that the original designers didn\\'t: If they were offered in a greater variety, kids might want to collect and trade them like Pokémon cards. It could be a $100 purchase made $4.95 at a time. Slowly and unpredictably, Silly Bandz began to draw kids in with its website, which Croak launched late in the summer of 2008. He also took full advantage of the new social order in promoting his product. The Silly Bandz Facebook page now has nearly 255,000 fans, and on YouTube (GOOG), some 2,000 videos have been posted about the bracelets, including a rap song that has been played almost 24,000 times. \"Silly Bandz are a great toy, a fashion accessory. There doesn\\'t need to be a reason,\" Croak says when asked about the way his product took hold. \"Why take the fun out of it?\"BCP is a private company, so sales figures aren\\'t available. The bands clearly are a financial bonanza, however. Sean McGowan, a toy industry analyst at Needham & Co., estimates that a package of 24 bands probably costs nickels to produce at BCP\\'s factory in China. Even after including packaging and transportation expenses, the profit margin could be close to 75%. As for Croak\\'s marketing strategy, he prefers to keep the details secret, lest he surrender another profit opportunity: \"I\\'ll save that for a book deal, O.K.?\" he says.BCP went from obscurity to the CBS Evening News in a matter of months, and the pressure on Croak is intense. \"It\\'s chaos every day,\" he says. Still, he tries to maintain a relaxed office atmosphere: Music is constantly playing, and the dress code is casual—Croak wears jeans and untucked shirts, and many of his young employees are in shorts. Competition emerged months after Croak launched Silly Bandz. An entrepreneur named James Howard introduced Zanybandz in Birmingham, Ala., after testing the product out on his nieces. It could be that Silly Bandz and its competitor are actually helping one another: The greater the awareness of the product, the more sales for everybody. \"Very often a second company ignites the whole market,\" says McGowan. Kids and stores don\\'t necessarily care which brand they have. The bands spread to Tennessee, Florida, New Jersey, Connecticut. By the summer of 2009, \"it started to get crazy,\" says Croak. \"We thought we were ramping up enough then, and we\\'ve grown four times since then. It\\'s a learning curve every week.\" Croak says BCP has gone from shipping 20 boxes of Silly Bandz a day to about 1,500. (The boxes contain anywhere from 24 to 500 packs.) He says Silly Bandz are carried in approximately 18,000 stores in 25 states.Croak\\'s career hasn\\'t been without its challenges. In 2002 he was convicted of one count of forgery for signing a check for a business associate and was put on probation. Two years later he was ordered to pay back taxes and penalties of about $45,000. \"It was a technical violation of the law,\" he says, referring to the forgery. One of the terms of his probation was that he was no longer allowed to own or operate a bar. \"As a result of this,\" he says, \"I chose to pursue bigger and better things.\" Regarding his tax bill, he says: \"Sometimes taxes don\\'t get paid on time, there are economic reasons. All of my taxes are paid and current.\" Croak was also involved in a controversial city-run project to develop a Toledo Civic Theater for which he would book concerts. The first ones, in the summer and fall of 2008, were successful. After that, though, Croak ended his role amid fighting between the city council and the mayor over how contracts had been awarded. Croak\\'s recent turn of fortune has been duly noted in east Toledo. Dan Steingraber, the chairman of a local business organization and a longtime associate, says: \"It\\'s fantastic. You never know what\\'s going to make you money. Rob has been throwing s—- at the wall for a long time. It\\'s good when something sticks.\"These days, Croak is creating jobs in a place that\\'s desperate for them. Once dominated by auto manufacturing, the Rust Belt city of roughly 300,000 now has an unemployment rate of 12%. Croak\\'s office staff has grown from around 20 people to nearly 70 in the past year, and there are approximately 200 salespeople working around the country. (BCP\\'s factory in China—Croak won\\'t say where it is—also brought in 700 new workers in the past five weeks.) With the momentum continuing to build, Croak is recruiting people through Craigslist to take phone orders, maintain the Silly Bandz website, and deal with shipping to homes, toy stores, and, soon, Macy\\'s (M). After the local newspaper, The Blade, ran a story about Silly Bandz, so many people came to the office looking for jobs that Croak had to lock the doors. One night, behind on a deadline, he put up a post on Facebook and 20 people arrived to help within an hour. Jared Hissem, 28 and married with a young child to support, was holding down two jobs, doing data entry at a market research firm, and working behind the counter at KFC (YUM) when he saw one of BCP\\'s postings. A couple of days later he had quit his other jobs and was taking orders over the phone for Croak. \"I had never heard of Silly Bandz until I got hired here. Now I love them,\" Hissem says. \"And it\\'s a laid-back work environment, with the music and all. I haven\\'t left once in a bad mood.\" Another new member of the workforce, a 23-year-old college graduate named Marcus Ahle, started as a Web programmer in mid-May after searching for work for months. \"I\\'m not worried about the fad ending,\" he says. \"I\\'m just thankful to have a job in this economy.\" Until recently, Croak\\'s workers were bringing hundreds of boxes of Silly Bandz a day to the post office to be weighed and stamped. The postmaster just asked Croak to get his own metering machine. He\\'s not sure if he can keep up: \"The demand changes every day. Supply-and-demand issues are good, though. It builds the anticipation and hype. A little scarcity is good.\"Just 40 minutes into an interview in his cramped office, Croak starts to look anxious; he wants to see how things are going in the warehouse. \"We have huge deals that are going to be national news,\" he says, \"but I can\\'t share them now. They\\'re reaching out to us. We\\'re reactive, not proactive.\" Although Walt Disney (DIS) has signed up with a competing brand, Character Bandz/Forever Collectibles, there are plenty of other licensing possibilities for Silly Bandz, from the Simpsons characters to Dora the Explorer. \"Let\\'s just say that the best names and icons in the United States will be represented by Silly Bandz in the coming weeks,\" Croak says. He has just introduced a UV-activated beach pack that changes color when the temperature rises. And he lets on that he\\'s going to put out his first celebrity pack, with a basketball player he won\\'t name, as well as backpacks and notebooks for the new school year. He says he has been talking to the owner of an amusement park and to the YouTube rapper.Croak envisions an empire of Silly Bandz, but if that doesn\\'t quite come to pass, he says he\\'ll be fine with it. \"This is proof that the American dream is still alive. Beanie Babies are not the must-haves anymore, but people still buy them. If Silly Bandz turns into that, it\\'s a great place to be.\"'),\n",

       "  'The inside of Studio Daniel Libeskind is crowded with hope. Every desktop, table, storage shelf, and file cabinet in the loft that serves as the firm\\'s Lower Manhattan headquarters sprouts a scale-model building. These detailed miniatures, made of plastic, cardboard, and wood, are an early step in the architectural process, a 3D glimpse of structures that, with a little faith and a lot of money, will one day rise from the ground, spreading good design along with the Libeskind name.On one table is a four-tower residential/hotel complex destined for Busan, South Korea, in 2011. On another is a 58-story condominium high-rise that just got under way in Toronto after a two-year hiatus. Over there is a shopping mall in City-Center in Las Vegas, which opened last December. And that\\'s where faith and financing reach their limits. The $80 million New Center for Arts & Culture in Boston? Canceled, as is the mixed-use seaside development in Monaco. A 54-story residential skyscraper in Warsaw grew to just 16 floors before the cash ran out. A 43-story condo in Los Angeles is delayed pending new financing. The World Trade Center redevelopment in New York has been scaled back after almost eight years of delays. \"You have to be an optimist as an architect,\" says Daniel Libeskind, 63, the firm\\'s founder and principal. \"I don\\'t know of a single project where someone said, \\'We just ran out of money, no more project.\\' Some of them are hibernating.\"Architecture is notoriously cyclical, rising and falling in tandem with real estate. Firms suffered large losses, and dumped employees, as construction sank in 1991-92 and again in 2002-03. Yet neither retrenchment approached the severity of the current slump. The American Institute of Architects\\' billings index—a survey of nearly 600 firms that measures planned construction—has been contracting for 26 consecutive months. Since mid-2008, when architecture employment in the U.S. peaked at 220,500 jobs, the profession has cut 55,000 people, or one in four, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The layoffs continued in March even as overall payrolls grew.Executives from architecture firms such as Gensler and Perkins + Will say that prior to the recession, they competed with just a handful of rivals on any given bid. Now, because work is so scarce, they commonly face 12 to 15 rivals. Fees have plunged as clients press the negotiating advantage and firms race one another to the bottom. Historically, margins averaged 15%, these executives say. That has fallen to 5% to 10%, and in some cases firms are submitting breakeven bids just to get the work. \"It\\'s a rough-and-tumble world out there,\" says David Gensler, executive director of Gensler, the biggest U.S.-based practice by number of architects. \"It\\'s become a battle for market share.\"In an attempt to compensate for the paucity of meal-ticket projects, major firms are broadening their services. Commercial architecture represented 50% of business at San Francisco-based Gensler in the mid-2000s. This year, that has dropped to 35%, with renovations of offices and car dealerships now the fastest-growing area. St. Louis-based HOK, which ranks second in the U.S. and fourth in the world, had two megaprojects in Dubai die within 36 hours in late 2008 and has stepped up its building rehab and product design practices. The firm recently launched a line of commercial lighting fixtures.None of those sidelines, though, brings in as much as soaring planes of concrete, steel, and glass. Revenue at HOK fell 21% in 2009, to $473 million. Vice-Chairman Clark Davis says labor accounts for more than 80% of costs, which left management little choice but to cut the workforce from 2,300 to 1,800 today. As revenues at Gensler fell 30% to under $500 million in 2008, the company cut 750 people from its workforce of 3,000.\"We\\'re not a flush industry. We\\'re not Goldman Sachs (GS),\" says Phil Harrison, CEO of Perkins + Will, which laid off 150 people, 10% of its workforce, over the past 18 months. He says the Atlanta-based partnership is moving further into urban planning, infrastructure projects, and building rehabs. Still, the firm won\\'t add personnel until next year at the earliest, Harrison says.The architecture recession has been just as brutal to the profession\\'s celebrities, or starchitects. Since the Frank Gehry-designed Guggenheim Museum Bilbao opened to the public in 1997, starchitects such as Gehry, Norman Foster (London\\'s glass-sheathed \"Gherkin\" and Wembley Stadium), and Santiago Calatrava (Athens\\' Olympic Stadium and the Milwaukee Art Museum) have become as famous as their buildings. Calatrava shared a booking with Sandra Bullock on Charlie Rose. Gehry has been featured in People magazine.Foster\\'s Foster + Partners fired 300 workers in 2009, a quarter of its total staff, and closed offices in Berlin and Istanbul. The London-based firm\\'s Russia Tower in Moscow, a wedge-shaped structure that would have topped out at nearly 2,000 feet, was canceled last year after the developer ran out of cash. Held up for years, Foster\\'s Tower 2 for a new World Trade Center in New York was postponed indefinitely in March. Calatrava\\'s twisting Chicago Spire, designed to surpass the city\\'s Willis Tower as the Western Hemisphere\\'s tallest building, was halted in late 2008, leaving a large pit in the ground. There\\'s not even a hole to mark the Spanish architect\\'s planned 835-foot-tall residential high-rise in New York; it was dropped because the developer couldn\\'t presell enough units. Among Calatrava\\'s more notable 2010 commissions is a stage set for the New York City Ballet.Frank Gehry has cut his Gehry Partners workforce from 250 to 120 since 2007, as clients shelved a $4 billion project in Brooklyn that would have filled 22 acres with offices and residences, and a $3 billion project in downtown Los Angeles that would have brought high-rise luxury condominiums and shopping to the area adjacent to Gehry\\'s undulating silver Walt Disney Concert Hall. Gehry, 81, says he enjoys managing a smaller staff, and the slower pace has given him time for oddball projects: He recently dashed off a hat design on his iPhone for Lady Gaga. Still, traveling to drum up jobs is aggravating, and, even as he remains selective, Gehry admits he\\'s settled for smaller commissions than he\\'s accustomed to. (\"I\\'m not taking on houses yet,\" he points out; houses, and their finicky owners and relatively measly price tags, are low on any celebrity architect\\'s list of desirable projects.) Still, work at Gehry Partners is so slack that the firm is going without summer interns.The lone starchitect who seems to be thriving in the downturn is Iraqi-born deconstructivist Zaha Hadid; her namesake firm hired 90 people over the past year, increasing its worldwide staff to nearly 400. Roberto Sforza, chief financial officer of the London-based practice, says revenue jumped 27% in the year ended Apr. 30, to $57 million, despite the cancellation of two trophy projects in Dubai in 2009 and, a year earlier, the headquarters for the Architecture Foundation in London. New projects elsewhere in the Middle East, such as the Stone Towers in Cairo, an office and residential complex more than twice as big as the Empire State Building in square footage, have more than made up for those setbacks. Sforza says Hadid has so much business—the firm is evaluating 87 additional projects and getting 20 inquiries a month—that it can charge more than the standard 15% markup. \"Clients are knocking on our doors more than ever,\" he says. Hadid, 59, is prospering not only because of her distinctive designs, says Paul Finch, editorial director of the Architectural Review/Architects\\' Journal. Since she is the first woman architect to gain name-brand status, her work comes with \"excitement, glamour, and an expectation of design beyond architecture,\" Finch says.Daniel Libeskind was a star, too, when his master plan was selected for the World Trade Center redevelopment in 2002. Shortly after, Libeskind—a naturalized American born in Poland—and his wife, Nina, relocated from Berlin to New York. He chose his new office because it was just a couple of blocks from Ground Zero. By late 2006, the studio had doubled to almost 70 employees in five years; there were so many projects, and so many incoming proposals, that the Libeskinds discussed another doubling of staff. By January 2009, the downturn had taken hold and, for the first time, Libeskind was laying people off. \"This was a terribly traumatic event,\" Nina Libeskind says.Today the Libeskinds think the worst might be over. True, the studio is getting 25% fewer new work proposals than in 2007, and the headcount remains 15% below its peak. But multiyear developments are under way in Italy and Singapore. The L Tower in Toronto is under construction after a two-year delay, and would-be clients in the Middle East, Asia, and South America are showing interest. The firm, which puts its annual revenue between $20 million and $25 million, has hired a half-dozen employees and, late last year, gave the 58-person staff small bonuses and 5% pay increases.Libeskind\\'s portfolio has become noticeably less glamorous, however. His latest jobs include shopping centers in Bern, Switzerland, and Las Vegas, a single-family home in Connecticut, limited-production \"Villa Libeskind\" prefab homes for German builder Proportion, and door handles for Italian manufacturer Olivari. Libeskind says he took the assignments because they seemed interesting, not because he needed the money. \"I didn\\'t come into architecture as a business,\" he says. \"I never started with the point of view of profitability. It was from sheer madness of loving architecture.\"He adds: \"I don\\'t think you can be a pessimistic architect, because even if you have no work, you are still working with drawings; you are still working on future ideas. Those buildings get built later.\" Maybe they will: His Jewish Museum in Berlin didn\\'t open until 2001. That\\'s 12 years after he was awarded the project.'),\n",

       "  'Margaret C. Whitman, the woman who made her career in consumer marketing—focus-grouping Mr. Potato Head proto- types for Hasbro (HAS), retooling toothpaste for Procter & Gamble (PG), and, of course, scaling eBay (EBAY) into a multibillion-dollar e-commerce monster—is now brand-building her newest product: Candidate Meg.Here is the product: tall, handsome woman, parade float stately, emerging from a tinted-window black Escalade in waist-length jacket, trousers, and pointy loafers, campaign workers and political consultants in a phalanx around her. In the hot California afternoon sun, her freckled skin appears pale and powder-dry. A few passersby stop and stare. \"Is that...wait a second...who IS that?\" She\\'s familiar, her TV spots inescapable, her serene, almost smug expression and from-nowhere accent (Long Island? Boston? Los Angeles? Silicon Valley? Where exactly is she from?) on those TV commercials an almost soothing soundtrack to California\\'s exasperating crises: \"If I could do one thing as governor of California, it would be to fix the business climate....\" The warm monotonous voice of fiscal reason, urging calm, urging change, urging a vote for Candidate Meg.Candidate Meg now crosses the sidewalk, on her way to her second event of the day, her 12th event of the week, her thousandth of a campaign that began in February 2009, now pitching the product to the Greater San Jose Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. She never quite gets used to this, she has said, the peculiar hustle of taking you, your being, and saying, buy this. Buy me. Buy Meg. Because I am the solution to all your problems, to all of California\\'s vast agglomeration of problems.\"I\\'m still learning a great deal,\" Whitman, 53, told me later, as if revealing a secret. \"I\\'m working hard at getting better, every day, every single week.\"If the governorship were awarded on the basis of a complicated multiple-choice exam instead of a statewide election, then Candidate Meg would be a shoo-in. (And one gets the sense that she would prefer that method of choosing a governor instead of an endless retail slog up and down a huge state.) When she made the decision to run, Whitman says it was because she wanted to govern; what she knew, but hadn\\'t quite reckoned with, was the inside-out, emotionally draining experience of marketing yourself to tens of millions. She is spending a chunk of her personal wealth—$59 million so far of a personal fortune estimated at more than $1 billion—mostly on ubiquitous TV and radio advertising. But you can\\'t pay somebody else to do all that old-fashioned, pound-the-pavement politicking for you.The new Whitman is just getting off the ground, and there\\'s no telling how high she can go. There is California, and then there is the national stage, where a natural opportunity awaits. From her pro-choice position to her elitist educational background and blue-chip training, she could be the crossover alternative to the Republican Party\\'s other female star, Sarah Palin. While she lacks Palin\\'s uncanny ability to connect with certain elements of the Republican base—it\\'s hard to picture Whitman shooting moose from a helicopter—she is a far more reassuring figure to many of the GOP\\'s top fund-raisers.Lavishly paid business leaders tend not to be the most popular people these days. But so precarious is the condition of public finance that ex-CEO office-seekers like Whitman see an opportunity for themselves. Now more than ever, their thinking goes, government needs private-sector discipline and proven corporate cost-cutters. Whitman is the best known of a wave of candidates with corner-office experience: Former Gateway President and Chief Operating Officer Rick Snyder is running for governor in Michigan, wrestling executive Linda McMahon is leading in Connecticut\\'s U.S.Senate Republican primary, and ex-Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) chief Carly Fiorina is in a tight Republican primary contest with former Representative Tom Campbell in the California senate race. Even Steve Poizner, Whitman\\'s challenger in the June primary—currently 49 points back in Whitman\\'s wake according to the Field Poll—was the CEO of a tech startup sold to Qualcomm (QCOM) in 2000 for $1 billion.For her part, Whitman has been stumping loudly and frequently about how she can unleash tech industry innovation on California\\'s fiscal crises—\"Silicon Valley is 130 miles from Sacramento,\" she often says in her stump speech. \"But it might as well be a million miles away by how Sacramento operates.\"Surveying the mess in California, you might naturally ask why anyone, especially someone accustomed to holding a position of authority, would want to be governor. No state was whacked harder by the successive collapses of technology and real estate. The narcotic prosperity thrown off by those speculative frenzies allowed Sacramento to mask underlying problems by temporarily inflating the tax base and delaying the inevitable budgetary reckoning. The state spent profligately over the last two decades, the budget going from $85 billion in 2000 to $140 billion-plus in 2008, while also cutting taxes. The California civil service added 42,000 jobs in the second half of the last decade, yet property taxes remain capped at 1%, forcing the state into an unhealthy reliance on capital-gains and income taxes.When those sources of income shriveled in the recession, they left a vast hole in a state where 40% of spending is mandated for public schools because of Proposition 98. Yet the school system ranks 46th in the country for spending per pupil. With a budget deficit projected to surpass $60 billion, California has the worst credit rating in the country. Public schools are laying off teachers, libraries are reducing hours, parks and beaches are closing, welfare and public health programs may be slashed. There is no map for getting back to normal.Hovering over all the chaos—and beckoning Republican dreamers to dive in and emulate his patented mix of optimism and conservatism—is the still-powerful aura of Ronald Reagan. Across America, every GOP candidate aspires to ownership of Reagan\\'s legacy, but the California statehouse, where Reagan became Reagan, is hallowed ground. Arnold Schwarzenegger, whose name Whitman never utters on the trail, ran as Reagan reborn. She also evokes Reagan on the trail, as a fearless free marketer who showed how to tame bureaucracies and Big Labor and allow the once-great state economy to regain its stride.The collapse of California\\'s business climate is a particularly mystifying aspect of the state\\'s malaise. How could a place that in the last 15 years incubated Google (GOOG), Facebook, Twitter, and eBay be hemorrhaging tens of thousands of businesses a year and a million jobs since 2000? Whitman raises the issue repeatedly on the stump, citing her difficulties building a new PayPal headquarters in 2006. \"Two and half years of trying to get permission, 25 permits, three consulting firms to navigate the labyrinth of regulations. This was for a building that was to house 3,000 white-collar workers. You would think the State of California would have been my best friend on this.\" Her argument is that regulation strangles even the most devoted Californians, who instead are taking their businesses to Nevada, Utah, Arizona, or in the case of Northrop Grumman (NOC), may be moving to either Virginia or Maryland.Compared with all the other problems facing the state right now, the treacherous business environment hardly fires up large blocs of voters, and the political forces that produced it are more powerful and well-entrenched than they may appear. A probusiness platform is not only tough to run on, it\\'s also hard to make good on. Schwarzenegger sold himself as a fiscally conservative businessman and subsequently presided over the biggest deficits in California history. The conventional wisdom is that he got played by the legislature, but it may be that he just didn\\'t have enough patience. Being governor of California doesn\\'t come with the sweeping powers that a CEO is used to having over her own company. Whitman\\'s capacity to keep going at a problem, to not get bored and lose resolve, could be what it takes to deal with an ornery and uncooperative legislature.Almost every day, someone asks Whitman why she is running for governor. She responds, almost reflexively, with an argument for competence. \"I really believe I can fix it,\" she says over and over. Of course, she\\'s also running because she has the time and money and she\\'s young enough not to want to spend the rest of her life jetting to occasional board meetings and taking lots of vacations. Whitman\\'s husband, Dr. Griffith Harsh, a neurosurgeon, recalls the moment he first glimpsed the arc of Whitman\\'s post-eBay career. In 2005 he joined her at an eBay Live! event: Legions of the virtual auction site\\'s buyers and sellers gathered in a convention center, networking, swapping tips, and, of course, meeting Meg, the CEO of the company that had enabled the creation of more small businesses than perhaps any other in history. She stood in the center of the convention floor, in a canary spread-collar shirt and blue pants, smiling, greeting her community—even bending to tickle a baby. \"I could see something in her,\" says Harsh, \"in the way she was smiling and loving the attention and shaking hands and posing for photos, that made me think, \\'hmmm, maybe politics.\\' \"The transition has required \"a different processing speed,\" says Whitman. She compares it to a two-year-long, pre-IPO road show, only \"you don\\'t get to throw it over to your CFO for 20 minutes.\"Her old boss at Bain & Co., former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, describes campaigning as \"the opposite of being a great CEO.\" Before co-chairing John McCain\\'s Presidential run, Whitman in 2007 was the financial co-chairwoman of Romney\\'s primary challenge; it was Romney who urged her to run for governor, helping push Meg past \"maybe\" in early 2009.\"Winning an election isn\\'t easy for a businessperson,\" Romney says. \"The most difficult part is the communications part of the campaign. In business it\\'s all results, and talk is irrelevant. And somebody who performs, you couldn\\'t care less how they talk. Look at Jack Welch, one of the great performers in American history, but he wouldn\\'t have been able to make the transition Meg is making.\"Whitman\\'s own staff admits she isn\\'t a natural, though they quickly add that she has the drive to remake herself into a winning candidate. \"She is so competitive,\" says communications strategist Rob Stutzman. \"She wants to govern, and to do that she knows she needs to become a better campaigner to get there. I worked for Arnold Schwarzenegger, who loved campaigning more than the governance. She\\'s not like that. But that\\'s what compels her to get better and better at this.\"Government needs to get out of the way of the American businessman. It\\'s a core GOP talking point, but the Schwarzenegger administration has demonstrated that even conservative voters are sensitive to the difference between passive and ineffective government. Schwarzenegger\\'s approval ratings stand at 23%, right where Gray Davis\\'s were when he was recalled, the lowest scores registered by a sitting governor in 50 years. Whitman trusts her own judgment and intelligence; she believes governing will come naturally. She guided eBay, an organization of 15,000 (larger, by the way, than the population of Wasilla, Alaska), from tiny startup to tech titan.But she never had to think about education, health care, or a rebellious legislature while doing so.Yet it\\'s Whitman\\'s business background that her backers always point to when explaining why they have such faith in her ability. After graduating from Harvard Business School, she was one of four women out of 100 people hired as brand assistants at P&G in 1979. Two years later she moved to Bain in San Francisco, again one of just a few women in the office. There she developed a reputation as a budget genius, urging clients to centralize purchases, and discovering, for example, that food service concessions at universities could save hours of prep time by washing potatoes in dishwashers. \"The thing about these kinds of savings is, you have to look for them,\" Whitman explains, \"These are not splashy, career-making projects that get you promoted.\"Whitman did get promoted, though. She moved from Bain to Walt Disney (DIS) in 1989 (DIS) and oversaw the expansion of theme stores overseas before getting her first CEO position at Florists\\' Transworld Delivery in 1995 (where her tenure was brief and mostly unhappy). When a headhunter called her about eBay she was at Hasbro, reviving the Playskool and Mr. Potato Head franchises.Her success at eBay starts with the obvious: She expanded the company from 30 employees to 15,000, took it public, and raised revenues from $4.7 million to $7.7 billion. Adam Cohen, in his book about eBay, The Perfect Store, describes her response to a cataclysmic 22-hour site crash in 1999 as an \"unlikely Winston Churchill, in the middle of it all, issuing orders and deploying troops as the Blitzkrieg raged around her.\" Whitman became the de facto chief technology officer during the crisis, and upon its resolution had her new CTO\\'s desk put in the cubicle next to hers. She became one of the most respected figures in the corporate world, and eBay became a global powerhouse, establishing dominant positions in Germany, India, and South Korea.There were missteps, too. EBay got trounced in the lucrative Japanese market by Yahoo! (YHOO) and squandered an early lead in China. (Whitman traveled frequently to Shanghai for a few months in vain hopes of reversing the slide in the company\\'s market share.) Her signature moves were a mixed bag. The $1.5 billion acquisition of PayPal in 2002 was a massive hit, ranking as one of the smartest big deals of the dot-com era, not least because it was executed after the bust when the company was cheap; her 2005 purchase of Skype, the Internet telephone service, has been widely criticized as an overreach, $3 billion for a company with minuscule revenues. Worse, Skype didn\\'t complement eBay\\'s core business, and will probably be spun off later this year at a loss of as much as $1.7 billion.Throughout her career Whitman demonstrated a flair for the undramatic, for doing her chores well and showing little vanity. But after building eBay into a global company that was poised to compete head-to-head with Amazon.com (AMZN), she lost her way, says Standard & Poor\\'s (MHP) analyst Scott Kessler, who has covered the company since 2000. \"The core business had matured, he says. \"Whatever vision she had about where to take the company from there was muddled.\" Whitman left eBay in 2007 not quite as damaged goods, but with serious questions about how much of her success there was due to being at the right place at the right time.A certain vision deficit is apparent on the campaign trail. Delivering her prescriptions for California, she speaks in numbered sentence sets—\"four problems,\" \"three areas,\" and \"two issues.\" Her platform is built around \"three primary goals,\" namely creating jobs, cutting spending, and fixing education. Whatever doesn\\'t \"fit in those baskets,\" she vows, will no longer be prioritized. It\\'s PowerPoint politics, willfully dull and unglamorous.It\\'s also elementary; what part of the governor\\'s job doesn\\'t fit into one of those areas, which could also be classified as economy, education, and state budget?The most gifted politicians manage to turn scripted \"messaging\" into stirring stump material, but there is nothing Churchillian in Whitman\\'s delivery. Says former colleague Rajiv Dutta, former eBay CFO and PayPal president, now a managing director at Elevation Partners: \"Clearly she doesn\\'t have the practiced ease of appearing to be intimate in front of millions, which career politicians have spent their lives perfecting.\"A more experienced campaigner—say, Attorney General and former Governor Jerry Brown, Whitman\\'s likely opponent in the general election on Nov. 2—might be able to exploit this weakness. It\\'s hard to imagine Brown, former Governor Moonbeam, as the more approachable candidate, but that\\'s how the race is shaping up. Brown is unopposed in the Democratic primary and has barely stepped out on the trail—yet the Whitman camp is already attempting to frame him as the politics-as-usual candidate, owned by the special interests that Whitman\\'s personal wealth insulates her from. \"I contrast myself to Jerry Brown,\" she says, \"who is 100% beholden to the unions.\" Early polls have the race as a dead heat.At Seal Beach\\'s Leisure World, a retirement community south of Long Beach, seniors drive electric buggies plastered with \"Nobama\" stickers to the Meg Whitman rally. After the singing of God Bless America, America the Beautiful, My Country, \\'Tis of Thee, and the national anthem, the candidate appears just in time for the Pledge of Allegiance. This afternoon rumors about what is in the Health Reform Bill are sweeping through the hall. At one point Elizabeth, the octogenarian next to me, says, \"They\\'re going to have IRS agents deciding who can go to the doctor.\"This isn\\'t Whitman\\'s natural constituency, but she does fine, enduring a few muted boos when her opposition to offshore drilling is raised. Backstage after the rally, it takes a few minutes for Whitman to veer away from the campaign speech and into an actual conversation. She is seated on a wooden chair, eagerly sparring with reporters in her usual attire of blouse, short jacket, slacks, and pointy pumps. Whitman spent most of last year held in check by her staff after a few awkward interviews, notably when she defended her sparse voting record to reporters at the state Republican convention last September—including not casting a vote for the governor recall in 2003—by explaining, \"I was focused on raising a family, on my husband\\'s career, and we moved many, many times.\" She has since tempered her imperiousness—perhaps that\\'s what Romney means by \"communication\"—and now says she enjoys the back and forth of these exchanges.\"I want the campaign to get better, be ready for the next challenges,\" Whitman says. \"I love the policy part of it. It\\'s been fun to dig in on that.\" In a debate with Poizner, she announced that she would suspend for a year the state\\'s compliance with Assembly Bill 32 that requires California to reduce emissions by 25% in a decade. She is the first candidate for governor to publish her own detailed policy statement, \"Building a New California,\" in which she lays out more of her ideas, all of which fit broadly into her three primary goals. While she has not gone as far as some of her fellow Republicans in demanding across-the-board tax cuts, Whitman has said she will give targeted tax cuts to businesses and a $10,000 tax credit for home purchases. Her education reform ideas revolve around finding efficiencies that allow more money to reach the classroom. Also, she wants faster-track charter school conversions so parents can \"immediately\" petition to turn a failing school into a charter school. And in classic Reagan mode, Whitman plans to cut the state bureaucracy by 40,000 employees, though her opponents have pointed out that the governor\\'s office only has authority over half the workforce, including public safety, which she says she will avoid cutting. So getting to 40,000 will be especially tricky, if not impossible.On a late afternoon this spring, Whitman is at home in Atherton, a picture-perfect Silicon Valley suburb.Her house is vast but tasteful, a colonial with green shutters, set back from a picket fence amid a garden bristling with old-growth willows, redwoods, and blue spruces. She sits on a white sofa with her legs folded beneath her, wearing a three- button black jacket, jeans, and no shoes. She picks absentmindedly at her toes as she speaks. In this kind of casual setting, the preppy high school athlete and Princeton Univer- sity graduate comes closer to the surface. There\\'s a lightness and charm that she has not yet figured out how to project in a bigger room. The run for governor of California, she admits, is harder than she expected.\"This has been new,\" she smiles. \"Campaigning is really different than being the CEO of a company, where you are leading a team....In campaigning, there is really only one asset—me—so it\\'s one giant linear program for one scarce resource. It\\'s been a challenge, but a fun challenge.\" After she says \"fun,\" she forces another little smile, one that shows plenty of teeth but doesn\\'t move the pale skin around her blue eyes.\"I\\'m a big believer in focus.\" She nods. \"And when I focus, I can do a lot of things. I learned that in business. Well, I\\'m really focused now.\"As you watch Whitman travel the state, doing two events a day, you can see the slow, incremental payoff of that focus. She seems to have absorbed the critique of observers like Raphael Sonenshein, a California State University Fullerton political science professor, who says \"she projects competence, though seldom likability,\" and is working hard to be warmer and more engaging.Of course, if Candidate Meg does become Governor Whitman, that might be when her real problems start. For 30 years the office has devoured its occupants, crushing the personal reputations and good intentions that got them elected. For Whitman, it could all come down to timing. If the California economy somehow comes roaring back, either from her policies or a renewed tech boom feeding off global demand, the state\\'s budget crisis could become a lot more manageable, and that might be all the turnaround she needs to vault into national politics. How much would the Republican Party love to have a certifiable non-Palin star who brings 55 electoral votes along with her? Many will argue that she can\\'t compete nationally with her moderate social views. Many will say an elitist from California can never connect with Iowa farmers or New Hampshire quarrymen.Tell that to Meg. Tell her it\\'s a problem.She\\'ll get right to work on it.'),\n",

She also evokes Reagan on the trail, as a fearless free marketer who showed how to tame bureaucracies and Big Labor and allow the once-great state economy to regain its stride.The collapse of California\\'s business climate is a particularly mystifying aspect of the state\\'s malaise. How could a place that in the last 15 years incubated Google (GOOG), Facebook, Twitter, and eBay be hemorrhaging tens of thousands of businesses a year and a million jobs since 2000? Whitman raises the issue repeatedly on the stump, citing her difficulties building a new PayPal headquarters in 2006. \"Two and half years of trying to get permission, 25 permits, three consulting firms to navigate the labyrinth of regulations. This was for a building that was to house 3,000 white-collar workers. You would think the State of California would have been my best friend on this.\" Her argument is that regulation strangles even the most devoted Californians, who instead are taking their businesses to Nevada, Utah, Arizona, or in the case of Northrop Grumman (NOC), may be moving to either Virginia or Maryland.Compared with all the other problems facing the state right now, the treacherous business environment hardly fires up large blocs of voters, and the political forces that produced it are more powerful and well-entrenched than they may appear. A probusiness platform is not only tough to run on, it\\'s also hard to make good on. Schwarzenegger sold himself as a fiscally conservative businessman and subsequently presided over the biggest deficits in California history. The conventional wisdom is that he got played by the legislature, but it may be that he just didn\\'t have enough patience. Being governor of California doesn\\'t come with the sweeping powers that a CEO is used to having over her own company. Whitman\\'s capacity to keep going at a problem, to not get bored and lose resolve, could be what it takes to deal with an ornery and uncooperative legislature.Almost every day, someone asks Whitman why she is running for governor. She responds, almost reflexively, with an argument for competence. \"I really believe I can fix it,\" she says over and over. Of course, she\\'s also running because she has the time and money and she\\'s young enough not to want to spend the rest of her life jetting to occasional board meetings and taking lots of vacations. Whitman\\'s husband, Dr. Griffith Harsh, a neurosurgeon, recalls the moment he first glimpsed the arc of Whitman\\'s post-eBay career. In 2005 he joined her at an eBay Live! event: Legions of the virtual auction site\\'s buyers and sellers gathered in a convention center, networking, swapping tips, and, of course, meeting Meg, the CEO of the company that had enabled the creation of more small businesses than perhaps any other in history. She stood in the center of the convention floor, in a canary spread-collar shirt and blue pants, smiling, greeting her community—even bending to tickle a baby. \"I could see something in her,\" says Harsh, \"in the way she was smiling and loving the attention and shaking hands and posing for photos, that made me think, \\'hmmm, maybe politics.\\' \"The transition has required \"a different processing speed,\" says Whitman. She compares it to a two-year-long, pre-IPO road show, only \"you don\\'t get to throw it over to your CFO for 20 minutes.\"Her old boss at Bain & Co., former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, describes campaigning as \"the opposite of being a great CEO.\" Before co-chairing John McCain\\'s Presidential run, Whitman in 2007 was the financial co-chairwoman of Romney\\'s primary challenge; it was Romney who urged her to run for governor, helping push Meg past \"maybe\" in early 2009.\"Winning an election isn\\'t easy for a businessperson,\" Romney says. \"The most difficult part is the communications part of the campaign. In business it\\'s all results, and talk is irrelevant. And somebody who performs, you couldn\\'t care less how they talk. Look at Jack Welch, one of the great performers in American history, but he wouldn\\'t have been able to make the transition Meg is making.\"Whitman\\'s own staff admits she isn\\'t a natural, though they quickly add that she has the drive to remake herself into a winning candidate. \"She is so competitive,\" says communications strategist Rob Stutzman. \"She wants to govern, and to do that she knows she needs to become a better campaigner to get there. I worked for Arnold Schwarzenegger, who loved campaigning more than the governance. She\\'s not like that. But that\\'s what compels her to get better and better at this.\"Government needs to get out of the way of the American businessman. It\\'s a core GOP talking point, but the Schwarzenegger administration has demonstrated that even conservative voters are sensitive to the difference between passive and ineffective government. Schwarzenegger\\'s approval ratings stand at 23%, right where Gray Davis\\'s were when he was recalled, the lowest scores registered by a sitting governor in 50 years. Whitman trusts her own judgment and intelligence; she believes governing will come naturally. She guided eBay, an organization of 15,000 (larger, by the way, than the population of Wasilla, Alaska), from tiny startup to tech titan. But she never had to think about education, health care, or a rebellious legislature while doing so.Yet it\\'s Whitman\\'s business background that her backers always point to when explaining why they have such faith in her ability. After graduating from Harvard Business School, she was one of four women out of 100 people hired as brand assistants at P&G in 1979. Two years later she moved to Bain in San Francisco, again one of just a few women in the office. There she developed a reputation as a budget genius, urging clients to centralize purchases, and discovering, for example, that food service concessions at universities could save hours of prep time by washing potatoes in dishwashers. \"The thing about these kinds of savings is, you have to look for them,\" Whitman explains, \"These are not splashy, career-making projects that get you promoted.\"Whitman did get promoted, though. She moved from Bain to Walt Disney (DIS) in 1989 (DIS) and oversaw the expansion of theme stores overseas before getting her first CEO position at Florists\\' Transworld Delivery in 1995 (where her tenure was brief and mostly unhappy). When a headhunter called her about eBay she was at Hasbro, reviving the Playskool and Mr. Potato Head franchises.Her success at eBay starts with the obvious: She expanded the company from 30 employees to 15,000, took it public, and raised revenues from $4.7 million to $7.7 billion. Adam Cohen, in his book about eBay, The Perfect Store, describes her response to a cataclysmic 22-hour site crash in 1999 as an \"unlikely Winston Churchill, in the middle of it all, issuing orders and deploying troops as the Blitzkrieg raged around her.\" Whitman became the de facto chief technology officer during the crisis, and upon its resolution had her new CTO\\'s desk put in the cubicle next to hers. She became one of the most respected figures in the corporate world, and eBay became a global powerhouse, establishing dominant positions in Germany, India, and South Korea.There were missteps, too. EBay got trounced in the lucrative Japanese market by Yahoo! (YHOO) and squandered an early lead in China. (Whitman traveled frequently to Shanghai for a few months in vain hopes of reversing the slide in the company\\'s market share.) Her signature moves were a mixed bag. The $1.5 billion acquisition of PayPal in 2002 was a massive hit, ranking as one of the smartest big deals of the dot-com era, not least because it was executed after the bust when the company was cheap; her 2005 purchase of Skype, the Internet telephone service, has been widely criticized as an overreach, $3 billion for a company with minuscule revenues. Worse, Skype didn\\'t complement eBay\\'s core business, and will probably be spun off later this year at a loss of as much as $1.7 billion.Throughout her career Whitman demonstrated a flair for the undramatic, for doing her chores well and showing little vanity. But after building eBay into a global company that was poised to compete head-to-head with Amazon.com (AMZN), she lost her way, says Standard & Poor\\'s (MHP) analyst Scott Kessler, who has covered the company since 2000. \"The core business had matured, he says. \"Whatever vision she had about where to take the company from there was muddled.\" Whitman left eBay in 2007 not quite as damaged goods, but with serious questions about how much of her success there was due to being at the right place at the right time.A certain vision deficit is apparent on the campaign trail. Delivering her prescriptions for California, she speaks in numbered sentence sets—\"four problems,\" \"three areas,\" and \"two issues.\" Her platform is built around \"three primary goals,\" namely creating jobs, cutting spending, and fixing education. Whatever doesn\\'t \"fit in those baskets,\" she vows, will no longer be prioritized. It\\'s PowerPoint politics, willfully dull and unglamorous. It\\'s also elementary; what part of the governor\\'s job doesn\\'t fit into one of those areas, which could also be classified as economy, education, and state budget?The most gifted politicians manage to turn scripted \"messaging\" into stirring stump material, but there is nothing Churchillian in Whitman\\'s delivery. Says former colleague Rajiv Dutta, former eBay CFO and PayPal president, now a managing director at Elevation Partners: \"Clearly she doesn\\'t have the practiced ease of appearing to be intimate in front of millions, which career politicians have spent their lives perfecting.\"A more experienced campaigner—say, Attorney General and former Governor Jerry Brown, Whitman\\'s likely opponent in the general election on Nov. 2—might be able to exploit this weakness. It\\'s hard to imagine Brown, former Governor Moonbeam, as the more approachable candidate, but that\\'s how the race is shaping up. Brown is unopposed in the Democratic primary and has barely stepped out on the trail—yet the Whitman camp is already attempting to frame him as the politics-as-usual candidate, owned by the special interests that Whitman\\'s personal wealth insulates her from. \"I contrast myself to Jerry Brown,\" she says, \"who is 100% beholden to the unions.\" Early polls have the race as a dead heat.At Seal Beach\\'s Leisure World, a retirement community south of Long Beach, seniors drive electric buggies plastered with \"Nobama\" stickers to the Meg Whitman rally. After the singing of God Bless America, America the Beautiful, My Country, \\'Tis of Thee, and the national anthem, the candidate appears just in time for the Pledge of Allegiance. This afternoon rumors about what is in the Health Reform Bill are sweeping through the hall. At one point Elizabeth, the octogenarian next to me, says, \"They\\'re going to have IRS agents deciding who can go to the doctor.\"This isn\\'t Whitman\\'s natural constituency, but she does fine, enduring a few muted boos when her opposition to offshore drilling is raised. Backstage after the rally, it takes a few minutes for Whitman to veer away from the campaign speech and into an actual conversation. She is seated on a wooden chair, eagerly sparring with reporters in her usual attire of blouse, short jacket, slacks, and pointy pumps. Whitman spent most of last year held in check by her staff after a few awkward interviews, notably when she defended her sparse voting record to reporters at the state Republican convention last September—including not casting a vote for the governor recall in 2003—by explaining, \"I was focused on raising a family, on my husband\\'s career, and we moved many, many times.\" She has since tempered her imperiousness—perhaps that\\'s what Romney means by \"communication\"—and now says she enjoys the back and forth of these exchanges.\"I want the campaign to get better, be ready for the next challenges,\" Whitman says. \"I love the policy part of it. It\\'s been fun to dig in on that.\" In a debate with Poizner, she announced that she would suspend for a year the state\\'s compliance with Assembly Bill 32 that requires California to reduce emissions by 25% in a decade. She is the first candidate for governor to publish her own detailed policy statement, \"Building a New California,\" in which she lays out more of her ideas, all of which fit broadly into her three primary goals. While she has not gone as far as some of her fellow Republicans in demanding across-the-board tax cuts, Whitman has said she will give targeted tax cuts to businesses and a $10,000 tax credit for home purchases. Her education reform ideas revolve around finding efficiencies that allow more money to reach the classroom. Also, she wants faster-track charter school conversions so parents can \"immediately\" petition to turn a failing school into a charter school. And in classic Reagan mode, Whitman plans to cut the state bureaucracy by 40,000 employees, though her opponents have pointed out that the governor\\'s office only has authority over half the workforce, including public safety, which she says she will avoid cutting. So getting to 40,000 will be especially tricky, if not impossible.On a late afternoon this spring, Whitman is at home in Atherton, a picture-perfect Silicon Valley suburb. Her house is vast but tasteful, a colonial with green shutters, set back from a picket fence amid a garden bristling with old-growth willows, redwoods, and blue spruces. She sits on a white sofa with her legs folded beneath her, wearing a three- button black jacket, jeans, and no shoes. She picks absentmindedly at her toes as she speaks. In this kind of casual setting, the preppy high school athlete and Princeton Univer- sity graduate comes closer to the surface. There\\'s a lightness and charm that she has not yet figured out how to project in a bigger room. The run for governor of California, she admits, is harder than she expected.\"This has been new,\" she smiles. \"Campaigning is really different than being the CEO of a company, where you are leading a team....In campaigning, there is really only one asset—me—so it\\'s one giant linear program for one scarce resource. It\\'s been a challenge, but a fun challenge.\" After she says \"fun,\" she forces another little smile, one that shows plenty of teeth but doesn\\'t move the pale skin around her blue eyes.\"I\\'m a big believer in focus.\" She nods. \"And when I focus, I can do a lot of things. I learned that in business. Well, I\\'m really focused now.\"As you watch Whitman travel the state, doing two events a day, you can see the slow, incremental payoff of that focus. She seems to have absorbed the critique of observers like Raphael Sonenshein, a California State University Fullerton political science professor, who says \"she projects competence, though seldom likability,\" and is working hard to be warmer and more engaging.Of course, if Candidate Meg does become Governor Whitman, that might be when her real problems start. For 30 years the office has devoured its occupants, crushing the personal reputations and good intentions that got them elected. For Whitman, it could all come down to timing. If the California economy somehow comes roaring back, either from her policies or a renewed tech boom feeding off global demand, the state\\'s budget crisis could become a lot more manageable, and that might be all the turnaround she needs to vault into national politics. How much would the Republican Party love to have a certifiable non-Palin star who brings 55 electoral votes along with her? Many will argue that she can\\'t compete nationally with her moderate social views. Many will say an elitist from California can never connect with Iowa farmers or New Hampshire quarrymen.Tell that to Meg. Tell her it\\'s a problem.She\\'ll get right to work on it.'),\n",

Andrew, a senior partner at Boston Consulting Group and head of its global innovation practice. \"The developed world\\'s hammerlock on innovation leadership is starting to break a little bit.\"HTC is typical of Asia\\'s ascendancy. Founded in 1997 as a contract manufacturer, the company has long been the world\\'s top maker of mobile handsets using Microsoft\\'s (MSFT) Windows Mobile operating system. It produced unbranded devices that bear the logos of such wireless giants as Verizon, T-Mobile, Sprint Nextel (S), and Japan\\'s NTT DoCoMo (DCM).As it became more sophisticated, HTC built the first phone powered by Google\\'s Android operating system, for T-Mobile, in 2008. It followed up with the Nexus One for Google, which was launched in January. Today, HTC is making and selling its own line of smartphones around the world, and roughly a quarter of the company\\'s 8,000-person workforce hold engineering-related jobs. HTC Chief Executive Peter Chou \"looks at what\\'s possible and then puts [in] the resources,\" says Paul E. Jacobs, CEO of Qualcomm (QCOM), a mobile-phone chipmaker and HTC partner. \"He\\'s willing to take the risk.\" Says Chou: \"Innovation is not a one-time job—innovation is a journey.\"These new innovators can provide substantial payoffs for investors. In 2008 a subsidiary of Warren Buffett\\'s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK) paid $230 million for a 10% interest in BYD, one of China\\'s biggest producers of batteries for cell phones and a fast-growing maker of green cars and solar panels. BYD\\'s Hong Kong-listed stock more than quintupled in 2009, as its profit tripled to $555.5 million. Buffett\\'s stake was worth $2 billion at the end of last year.Though BYD makes conventional gas-powered cars, with prices starting at just $8,800, the 15-year-old company is branching out to alternative-powered vehicles. BYD, which stands for Build Your Dreams, began selling a $24,900 hybrid car in China this month—the car can be recharged by plugging it into a standard home outlet. It also teamed up with Germany\\'s Daimler (DAI) in March to build all-electric cars for China. BYD will begin selling electric cars in the U.S. this year and both hybrids and electrics in Europe by 2011.With millions of Chinese choking on some of the world\\'s most polluted air, the Chinese government is eager to promote more eco-friendly cars, providing an opening for BYD, says Michael Clendenin, managing director of RedTech Advisors, a consulting firm in Shanghai. \"If BYD can truly punch something out, they\\'ve got a wide-open market in China,\" Clendenin says. \"The Chinese government will come behind them and help them with the charging infrastructure to make electric cars in China viable.\"The Chinese government is also trying to encourage more companies to be innovators. Beijing has implemented new procurement policies to promote what it calls \"indigenous innovation\" by requiring locally made technology in certain government purchases. U.S. and other foreign companies have cried foul, alleging that China\\'s new rules favoring locals amount to trade barriers in sectors from environmental technology to telecom (BW—Apr. 5).China\\'s indigenous initiative isn\\'t the main driver of innovation there, according to Boston Consulting\\'s annual survey of top executives, which provides the raw data for our list. The survey suggests the crucial factor is a mindset—a belief that innovation matters. In China, 95% of executives said innovation was the key to economic growth, while 90% and 89% of respondents in South America and India, respectively, agreed. In the U.S., only 72% said innovation was important.Similarly, 88% of executives in China said they were raising their innovation budgets this year, followed by 82% in South America and 73% in India. The rate fell to 48% in the U.S., ahead of only Japan, where just 34% of executives said their companies planned to increase innovation spending. All of which suggests the U.S. may not be dominating the list again soon.Even in the U.S., barely half of respondents (53%) said they think U.S. companies will be the most innovative over the next five years. \"We\\'re moving to a place where innovation leadership is going to be more dispersed than in just the U.S., Western Europe, and Japan,\" says Boston Consulting\\'s Andrew.The shift is more apparent when this year\\'s class is compared with the first ranking in 2005. Back then, only six of the Top 20 were headquartered outside the U.S., vs. 13 of 25 this year. In addition a third of 2005\\'s American champs—such names as 3M (MMM), Starbucks (SBUX), and eBay (EBAY)—no longer make the Top 50.As specific Asian companies charge ahead in the global ranking, many analysts and executives complain that overall, businesses in China, Korea, and India aren\\'t all that innovative. Their domestic economies are growing so quickly—and there are so many opportunities to launch tried-and-true business models—that these companies don\\'t need to come up with the Next Big Thing. Sticking with the Same Old Thing suits many companies and investors just fine.\"You need something revolutionary to come along in the U.S. to really make an outsize return,\" says William Bao Bean, a Shanghai-based partner with Softbank China & India Holdings, a $105 million venture fund backed by Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Softbank. In Asia\\'s big two countries, \"you don\\'t need to make a revolution,\" he says. \"There\\'s low-hanging fruit to be had.\"The huge home market is helping China Mobile grow bigger and, the company hopes, more advanced. The world\\'s largest cellular operator agreed last month to buy 20% of Shanghai Pudong Development Bank for $5.8 billion. The investment should help China Mobile provide wireless banking services to its 527 million customers, helping to solve a chronic problem plaguing the e-commerce industry in China, where use of credit cards is not widespread.For many companies, though, relying on the easy pickings in China and Taiwan is no longer an option. HTC is feeling pressure from Chinese rivals such as ZTE Corp. and Huawei Technologies, which are taking advantage of Google\\'s open-platform Android operating system to get into the smartphone business, too. \"Android has become the great equalizer,\" says Aloysius Choong, an analyst in Singapore with researcher IDC. Because Android takes a lot of the innovation burden off of the hardware companies, it lowers the entry barrier for newcomers. That\\'s one reason analysts think HTC may make an offer for Palm, the U.S.-based smartphone maker that has put itself up for sale, according to people familiar with the situation. The battle is notable, of course, because it is an innovation-driven skirmish between Chinese and Taiwanese players—something that simply didn\\'t happen a decade ago.Chou, HTC\\'s chief, acknowledges that competition is intensifying. \"We never underestimate the potential competition coming from elsewhere, either from top-tier premium brand companies or companies from China or Taiwan. What is important for HTC, we need to continue to provide a unique and differentiated value to our customer.\"Apple also wants to take HTC down a peg. In March, the iPhone-maker filed a complaint with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and a lawsuit in U.S. District Court alleging HTC\\'s smartphones infringed on Apple patents. HTC denies the claims. \"HTC has been innovative from the beginning,\" says Chou. \"We were working on this for a long time before the iPhone came out.\"Bloomberg BusinessWeek\\'s Most Innovative Companies special report is based on data from longtime partner Boston Consulting Group (BCG). Last December the consultancy e-mailed a 21-question poll to senior executives around the globe. The 1,590 respondents, who answered anonymously, were asked to name the most innovative companies from outside their own industry in 2009. BCG then factored in the financial performance of the top vote-getters. The final list weights the survey results 80%, stock returns 10%, and three-year revenue and margin growth 5% each.For the 2010 report, BCG changed the survey\\'s distribution so that responses better reflected each country\\'s share in the world economy. That meant fewer questionnaires to India, Italy, Spain, and the U.S. and more to Germany, Japan, and other countries in Asia. To improve the response rate, BCG also translated the poll into Japanese and Chinese. BCG found that the recalibrated sample may have altered the rankings of individual companies by a few places, but it did not account for the tilt away from the U.S. and toward the rest of the world. Performance and reputation did.With Tim Culpan in TaipeiReturn to the Most Innovative Companies Table of Contents'),\n",

       "  '2010-03-11',\n",
       "  'Once upon a time, not so long ago, a bunch of small companies in Silicon Valley thought the future of television was theirs. Soon, the thinking went, TV would be everywhere. Frequent fliers would tune in on laptops and vacationers on tablets from the beach. If so inclined, you\\'d be able to watch Glee on a cell phone in a tree house. The network suits and the cable guys just didn\\'t have the digital chops to make it happen. Fueled with venture money, tech companies with names like Boxee, Roku, and Sezmi pursued their dream of untethering viewers from their TV sets—and owning a piece of the advertising revenue.As the big picture comes into focus though, it looks like the cable guys are playing the lead roles, using the $32 billion they pay content providers each year as leverage. The alphabet soup of newbies is still waiting in the wings for a moment that might never come.What happened? Part of the answer is TV Everywhere, a service in its infancy, conjured up in quiet strategy sessions by Jeff Bewkes and Brian Roberts, the CEOs of Time Warner (TWX) and Comcast (CMCSA). They took a lesson from the music labels, which looked up one day to find that Steve Jobs and Apple (AAPL) had taken control of their inventory. The cable guys came up with a quick fix, one so technologically simple that you don\\'t have to be a geek to get it: Viewers can watch shows for free, but only if they\\'re cable subscribers first. In other words, as long as you tap a subscription code into your device—any device—you can watch anything you want, whenever you want.It\\'s worth hitting pause here for a moment. Right now, Time Warner is offering the service in only a few markets. Comcast has rolled out a trial, or beta, version to about 80% of its subscribers. There are plenty of kinks to be sorted out. And as usual when it comes to show business, nothing is quite as simple as it appears. For TV Everywhere to work, the behemoths of the business must stand together and stamp out the rampaging weed called free. After all, if you can get programing for free—real free—why would you ever pay a cable bill?That\\'s what was worrying Time Warner\\'s Bewkes in the fall of 2008. Back then, Time Warner ran the country\\'s second-largest cable operator (spun off in March 2009) and was also a content provider. Bewkes had previously been in charge of the company\\'s HBO unit, turning the premium cable channel into a profit machine with 30 million subscribers.Bewkes watched with growing alarm as Hollywood stampeded online to offer TV shows and movies for free, say two Time Warner executives. At the time, Hulu, a video site operated by Fox (NWS), NBC Universal, and Disney, (DIS) was about a year old. For TV addicts, Hulu was a near miracle. Miss the latest episode of Damages on the FX channel? If so, you could watch Glenn Close play a conniving lawyer on Hulu 24 hours later for free. Hulu\\'s owners shared the advertising revenue from the site, but everyone knew it wasn\\'t making money and there was no clear path to profitability. As he watched one entertainment company after another put their TV shows and movies online for free, say the executives, Bewkes began to fear that the pay TV industry would eventually find itself in the same untenable position as newspapers.That\\'s when the scene shifts to Wisconsin, where HBO was running an experiment in Milwaukee and Green Bay. HBO was letting people watch its programing online as long as they could prove they were HBO subscribers. The results of the test were unexpected: Viewers who tuned into Big Love on their laptops didn\\'t spend any less time watching HBO on their TV sets. Bewkes was buoyed by the possibility that the same model might work more widely and that his cable properties might be able to keep subscribers from gravitating elsewhere, says a Time Warner executive involved in the discussions. Bewkes told his team: \"We can\\'t just talk about it, or play the victim. We need to build a model,\" the executive recalls. The Time Warner CEO was unavailable for comment.It wasn\\'t the first time the cable industry had found itself in danger of being outflanked by tech-savvy rivals. In 1999, TiVo began selling a handy little box that allowed people to record dozens of hours of TV shows on a hard drive. After a certain amount of handwringing, the cable guys struck back with overwhelming force. They figured out the technology and marketed their own digital video recorders, for which they charged subscribers an extra $10 or so a month. Next came Apple. Along with Amazon.com (AMZN) and others, Steve Jobs began renting TV shows online. The cable companies beat back that onslaught by beefing up their video-on-demand offerings and giving subscribers a bunch of free shows with a few clicks of the remote. \"The cable industry has been very good at not jumping too early on a technology, and watching it play out first,\" says Colin Gounden of Grail Research, which advises companies on new products. \"They have a knack for getting the timing right.\"The new attack from Silicon Valley was the most serious yet, because it threatened to permanently cut the coaxial connecting the cable companies and their subscribers. \"We wake up every day and there is some new competitor out there—a Roku or a Boxee,\" says Melinda Witmer, Time Warner Cable\\'s programming chief. \"People like to think of cable operators as monopolists, but we face a lot of competition just to keep the business we have.\" Technically there was nothing too complicated about Bewkes\\' plan to expand the Milwaukee experiment.The new service would need a way to automatically confirm that people were paid-up subscribers. Other than that, TV Everywhere, as Bewkes called it, would mostly use existing online infrastructure and established user interfaces.Far more daunting was the prospect of persuading the rest of the industry to join up. Unless most of the pay TV and content players banded together, TV Everywhere wouldn\\'t work; viewers could simply flock to sites that didn\\'t require a cable subscription. Bewkes, say two Time Warner executives, decided to float his proposal with Roberts, the chief of Comcast, the largest cable system in the U.S., with 24 million subscribers. In early 2009, Bewkes began wooing Roberts, traveling from his New York City office on Columbus Circle to Comcast\\'s imposing 57-story headquarters in Philadelphia.Roberts long ago realized that online video was important to the future of his company. In 2006, Comcast had created an interactive media unit that poached heavily from Silicon Valley. The company\\'s first major development project was Fancast, a video site like Hulu that offered hundreds of shows free to all comers. Roberts, who declined to be interviewed for this story, had unveiled Fancast at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in early 2008. Before long, says one Comcast executive, he began thinking about a service that would offer much more content—but only to Comcast subscribers. When Bewkes came calling he didn\\'t have to convince Roberts of the importance of preserving the subscription model online. And like most everybody in the cable industry, Roberts was aware of HBO\\'s online experiment in Wisconsin.Roberts and Bewkes initially disagreed on one big point, say two Time Warner executives who say they can\\'t speak on the record because the discussions were sensitive. Roberts believed subscribers should be required to go to a central site operated by their pay TV provider in order to view cable shows. Bewkes, true to his divided soul as a content creator and distributor, felt users should be allowed to tap into any cable channel\\'s Web site as long as it was part of the TV Everywhere ecosystem. Bewkes, say the executives, reasoned that letting individual channels keep their own sites would allow them to maintain their brands. Eventually, Roberts agreed.The Time Warner executives say Roberts and Bewkes saw the cable industry\\'s annual convention, held last April in Washington, D.C., as an opportunity to proselytize about TV Everywhere to the rest of the industry. During one panel discussion, Roberts told his audience that online video was \"a friend, not a foe\" and that for Hollywood it represented a new way to make money \"in this horrific advertising environment.\"In Hollywood, studios and cable channels were hearing a very different message from the Silicon Valley upstarts who wanted to cut deals for their programing. Netflix\\'s (NFLX) Ted Sarandos pushed studio executives to give his company the latest movies for its online video service. Steve Jobs proposed launching a stripped-down cable service that would cost consumers $30 a month. Boxee founder Avner Ronen says he traveled to Los Angeles from his base in New York so many times that his \"plane knew the way.\"Phil Wiser, founder of Sezmi, an online TV subscription service, says his goal was simple: to \"replace cable and satellite.\" He flew executives from NBC Universal, Sony (SNE), the Discovery Channel, and others to Sezmi\\'s offices in a converted horse barn in Northern California, where he wined, dined, and pitched them. Sezmi wanted the content creators to allow him to use their movies and TV shows for an à la carte service that would give customers the freedom to pay for only what they wanted to watch. The studios declined, so he decided to borrow the industry\\'s subscription model. Owners of Sezmi\\'s $299 set-top box would receive network and cable shows for $19.99 a month, about a third the cost of a typical cable subscription.Wiser told the studios that he would match what cable was paying for episodes of such shows such as The Real World, Top Chef, and Damages. It was an unprecedented offer for a startup, but only one company initially agreed to make its content available: NBC Universal, which is already available on Hulu. Wiser says it took another 18 months to lure more content providers, including Turner Broadcasting (TWX) (owned by Time Warner) and Discovery Networks. What\\'s more, Wiser acknowledges he had to pay the content guys more than they get from the big cable companies. When Sezmi boxes went on sale in Los Angeles in February, the service was missing ESPN, The History Channel, The Food Network, HBO, and other popular channels. \"Trying to do this is not for the faint of heart,\" says Wiser, a former Sony (SNE) executive. \"These firms see dozens of new pitches every week, so they\\'re skeptical.\"Skeptical—and satisfied. The makers of movies and TV shows are attached to the billions they receive from cable companies and are understandably reluctant to engage in grand experiments with upstarts touting unproven business models. Joshua Sapan runs Rainbow Media Holdings (CVC), which controls AMC, IFC, the Sundance channel, and others. He says tech companies have approached him about licensing AMC shows, but, he asks: \"Why would I license my channel to someone and give them Mad Men the day after it shows up on AMC?\"Back at Time Warner Center in New York and One Comcast Center in Philadelphia, the cable operators began to realize they had the studios locked down. As Frank Biondi, former president of the media giant Viacom (VIA), puts it: \"Why would [the studios] make a deal with a competitor to their largest customer and risk angering them?\"In summer 2009, Bewkes and Roberts joined forces to take the TV Everywhere model out for a spin with 5,000 Comcast subscribers across the country. Those viewers were able to tap into programing provided by cable channels TNT and TBS, both owned by Time Warner. The speed with which the industry moved on from that trial balloon is a measure of just how important locking in subscriber revenue is to cable\\'s future. In December, Comcast rolled out a beta version of the new service, now christened Fancast XFinity TV. Time Warner Cable has a trial going with nearly 10,000 customers in Syracuse, N.Y., New York City, and Columbus, Ohio. Verizon Communications (VZ) is testing a service nationally, and DirecTV, the satellite operator, plans to as well.Comcast\\'s service is the furthest along and provides a window on where TV Everywhere is headed. Only subscribers who pay for digital cable—and take Comcast\\'s broadband service—are eligible. (The company is still working out how to bring XFinity TV to the third of its subscribers who get broadband from other companies.) Subscribers can tune into two dozen channels, from CBS to Animal Planet, and view 19,000 full-length TV shows and movies. They can use it on as many as three PCs and get most episodes 24 hours after they first air on TV. Much of that was available on Comcast\\'s free site, but now shows on HBO and the Discovery channel have been added to the lineup. Eventually, Comcast aims to let subscribers access XFinity on their smartphones and tablets.TV Everywhere has a ways to go before the cable guys can declare victory. There\\'s a ton of stuff to figure out—how the ad model will work, devising a new ratings system with Nielsen. And then there\\'s the question of profits. The cable guys like them, and they\\'re not real comfortable with free. So chances are, down the line, the costs of the new free will probably sneak onto subscribers cable bills. And you know what? We\\'ll all keep paying.'),\n",
