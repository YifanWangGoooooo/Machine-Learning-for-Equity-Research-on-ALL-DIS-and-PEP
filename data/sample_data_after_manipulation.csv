badly during the holidays reporting earnings that were below forecasts and the company s outlook for this year was much worse than expected sending the stock down in early trading shares are down this year the terrible numbers from target tgt are just another sign of how tough it is for traditional retailers to compete against the online juggernaut that is amazon amzn our fourth quarter results reflect the impact of rapidly changing consumer behavior which drove very strong digital growth but unexpected softness in our stores said brian cornell chairman and ceo of target to target s credit the company has embraced e commerce target said digital sales were up from a year ago that s higher than amazon s overall sales growth during the holidays and even outpaced the jump in online revenue growth that walmart wmt posted in the fourth quarter the problem is that online sales are not growing quickly enough to offset the sales declines in target s physical stores target said overall revenue fell more than from a year ago part of that was because of target s decision to sell its in store pharmacies to cvs cvs in late but revenue was down at target even after factoring in the absence of pharmacy sales from the fourth quarter of s results related move over amazon here comes walmartconsumers are increasingly shunning traditional retailers like target and shopping online macy s m kohl s kss jcpenney jcp and sears shld have also been hit hard by this shift in recent years target seems to have been caught off guard by the magnitude of the change though the company had predicted a strong holiday quarter in november but warned in january that its results would miss forecasts the numbers target reported on tuesday were even worse than what it forecast last month the company expects earnings for the first quarter and the full fiscal year will be lower than what wall street analysts were predicting and target said same store sales which measures the performance of stores open at least a year will fall in the first quarter and for the full year a decline in commodity prices has also led to problems in target s grocery division many big supermarket chains like kroger kr and whole foods wfm have warned that while lower food prices can be good news for consumers they hurt profit margins for retailers target said it plans to transition to a new financial model during a conference call with analysts tuesday morning executives talked about how target will spend more to revamp existing stores open new stores upgrade its supply chain and inventory management and boost its digital operations at a time when many others are shrinking we are investing chief financial officer cathy smith said she added that the company will look to lower prices and add a dozen exclusive brands cornell tried to stress the positive aspects of target s new plan saying that target is doubling down while many of its competitors are struggling to survive he also said the company will lower prices to be more competitive with other retailers related here s why amazon might buy a big retailerbut analysts are still worried neil saunders managing director for globaldataretail said in a report target should not chase walmart on price as it is a battle that cannot easily be won we also believe that many of target s issues are not solely price related joleen wroten senior retail strategist with retail intelligence firm pi agreed that target would lose a price war with amazon she wrote that target has to differentiate with exclusive affordable fresh product offerings coupled with clean and easy shopper experiences and worry less about having lower prices than walmart and cowen analyst oliver chen said in a report that the company has a lot of work to do to win back market share and be more competitive against amazon walmart and big supermarkets the company needs to do a better job executing and attracting shoppers looking to just pick up a few items vs stocking up we also believe food remains a work in progress chen wrote target s woes are the latest setback for a company hit by a massive data breach in the credit and debit cards of about million customers were stolen the problems led to the ouster of longtime ceo gregg steinhafel cornell formerly an executive at pepsi pep took over in and had appeared to right the ship sales went back up but cornell now

at an impressive clip the bad news for the market is that corporate profits likely won t repeat the incredible growth of during the first quarter a performance that bank of america merrill lynch hailed as good as it gets the good news is that virtually everyone thinks s p earnings will grow again marking the fourth straight quarter that s very important because earnings not politics or tweets typically drive stock prices factset predicts that s p earnings will be up by a solid during the second quarter actual growth is likely to be stronger than that because analysts typically low ball their estimates making it easier for companies to beat the numbers growth should decelerate but remain healthy after a great first quarter bank of america merrill lynch predicted in a report on monday if that plays out u s stocks could build on a terrific first half of the year the dow and s p are up more than so far in while the nasdaq has soared about thanks to strength from tech stocks stronger

thing venezuela has in abundance is chaos the economy has spiraled toward collapse and a humanitarian crisis has plunged hordes into needless sickness and starvation the country is also in the grip of a political crisis the referendum on sunday called by president nicolas maduro could erode the last vestiges of democracy the vote would allow him to rewrite the constitution and replace the national assembly which is controlled by the opposition with an entirely new legislative body filled with his hand picked nominees venezuela was once the richest country in latin america here s how it fell apart related live updates from venezuelavenezuela holds the world s largest supply of crude oil what once seemed like an endless gusher of cash now the government is running out of money prices are soaring and nobody knows how much worse it will get venezuela was a powerhouse of south america in the s former president bill clinton made it his first stop on a trip to the region in but inequality grew extreme a small elite class controlled everything while the increasingly impoverished masses fumed the country turned toward socialism in and elected hugo chavez president he championed populism cut ties with the united states and cozied up to china and russia both of which loaned venezuela billions chavez ruled until his death in and is still seen today as a hero for the poor related venezuelans lose weight as food shortages worsenbut his government far overspent on welfare programs and it fixed prices for everything it declared farmlands state property and then abandoned them and instead made the nation dependent on selling its oil abroad before he died chavez picked maduro to succeed him and maduro kept up the regime s practices his administration also stopped publishing any reliable statistics including on economic growth and inflation it accepted millions in bribes for construction projects and racked up debts that it is still struggling to pay meanwhile the only commodity venezuela had left began to plunge in value in the price of oil was about a barrel then several countries started to pump too much oil as previously inaccessible oil could be dredged up with new drilling technology at the same time businesses globally weren t buying more gasoline too much oil caused the global price to drop to in today it hovers around which means venezuela s income has been cut in half related trump could hit venezuela where it hurts oilwith oil prices low and the government s cash dwindling price controls have become a huge problem the state still subsidizes food far below normal prices to appease the poor maduro has printed money at breakneck speed and the bolivar has plunged in value wiping out jobs and income at the same time maduro s hostility to foreign business has created a corporate exodus pepsi pep general motors gm and united ual are just some of the companies that have cut back or left entirely unemployment in venezuela this year could reach according to the international monetary fund inflation is only getting worse in one american dollar was worth about eight bolivars today it s worth over bolivars according to the unofficial exchange rate which many venezuelans use because government rates are considered far overvalued prices could rise an astounding next year to keep up maduro has raised the minimum wage three times this year that has provided a little short term relief to the poor but experts say it creates long term pain in the form of a worthless currency the economy is really chaotic it s totally collapsed it s at the point of no return says alberto ramos an economist who heads latin america research at goldman sachs maduro blames his opponents for venezuela s economic woes and says u s sanctions on venezuelan leaders are proof the united states is waging an economic war regardless of where the blame lies humanitarian misery has followed the economic plunge related venezuela s hyperinflation is jaw dropping see for yourselffor several years maduro has had a stark choice pay down debts to china russia and foreign investors or buy food and medicine from abroad he has chosen to pay the bills the result starving venezuelans and soaring deaths in hospitals food shortages are so severe that the average venezuelan living in extreme poverty lost pounds last year according to a national poll there are people in venezuela who are literally starving this is apocalyptic stuff says eric farnsworth vice president at the council of the americas a business organization i would call venezuela a failing state related venezuelans scramble for food but it s often out of reachvenezuela ships in food primarily from brazil colombia and mexico because the government stopped cultivating its rich farmland years ago for the first five months of this year food exports from those countries to venezuela were down from the same period in according to panjiva a research firm medical shortages are worse women died during and shortly after childbirth last year a increase from according to a rare release of government records that maduro condemned nearly infants died in a rise from the prior year malaria cases jumped to a rise from even at the hospital there is still no food for the patients says dr huniades urbina medina head of pediatrics at hospital de ni os j m de los rios a children s hospital in caracas we still don t have medicines x rays ct scans nothing it s not just food and medicine venezuelans sometimes must ration electricity and water during droughts the crises have literally pushed venezuela s upper and middle classes out creating a severe brain drain nearly million venezuelans have left the country since according to research by tomas paez a sociology professor at the central university of venezuela in caracas venezuela is a country of only million people it seemed like a potential political turning point in when opposition leaders won a majority of seats in the national assembly dealing a blow to maduro but gridlock was the result early in maduro stacked the supreme court with his supporters to block the national assembly from impeaching him then in march the supreme court attempted to dissolve the national assembly altogether leading to months of protests that have left nearly dead sunday s vote brings the turmoil to a head as venezuela lurches into chaos maduro acts as if the opposite is true he recently tweeted a video of himself driving through caracas on streets tightly controlled by the police on camera maduro insists the streets are safe and that people are working and living ordinary lives but just a few miles away off camera young venezuelans clashed with riot police as fires burned in the

past two decades shares have barely budged while archrival pepsi pep and the s p have soared it s easy to see why coke has struggled sales and profits haven t been growing all that much and there s been a backlash to both full calorie sodas as well as some of coke s diet drinks due to the use of artificial sweeteners diet coke s sales slide has been particularly problematic that s why coke began

charitable giving workers can also benefit indirectly from stock buybacks if shareholders end up using their winnings to make investments that create new jobs it frees up capital to go back into the economy what good does trillion sitting offshore in tech companies accounts do asked nicholas colas co founder of datatrek research but some companies wishing to use their tax savings on new factories or hiring workers may not have seen enough evidence that expansion is warranted just because you have the cash coming in doesn t magically create opportunities to invest said colas colas also said that buybacks provide an important signal that can boost stock prices when stock prices rise they inspire more confidence and confidence leads to more hiring and wage increases he said critics of buybacks note that america s wealthiest families tend to benefit disproportionately from a booming stock market and thus buybacks the top of households owned of all stocks in according to paper

tammy baldwin plans to introduce a bill on thursday that would prohibit companies from repurchasing their shares on the open market baldwin told cnnmoney while the legislation faces an uphill battle getting through republican controlled congress it demonstrates a growing backlash against companies using extra cash to reward shareholders instead of sharing it with workers buybacks which boost stock prices by making shares scarcer have exploded in thanks to the huge windfall created by president trump s new tax law american companies like pepsi pep and cisco csco have announced a total of billion of buybacks so far this year according to research firm trimtabs companies are on track to buy back the largest number of shares in at least a decade critics say this trend is deepening the chasm between america s rich and poor because affluent families own the vast majority of the stocks they argue the money would be better spent by investing in the future paying workers more or offering better benefits and retraining programs i fear that if we don t act the impact on our economy and growth is going to be horrendous baldwin told cnnmoney wednesday this very partisan corporate tax bill has fueled a surge in stock buybacks that is hurting economic growth and shared prosperity for workers related are buybacks deepening income inequality the bill which is co sponsored by democrats elizabeth warren and brian schatz would explicitly prohibit public companies from repurchasing their shares on the open market it would also repeal a sec rule that gave companies the green light to buy back vast amounts of their own stock prior to that regulation buybacks lived in a murky area buybacks are a bit of a financial engineering trick by eliminating shares buybacks inflate a critical measure of profitability nobel prize winning economist robert shiller recently told cnnmoney buybacks are smoke and mirrors if baldwin s legislation becomes law companies would still be permitted to conduct tender offers which are stock purchases offered to all shareholders at a precise price typically a premium and a set date buybacks are considered less transparent because they take place over a longer time period at whatever price the stock is trading another provision of the bill would amend current rules to require all us public company boards to have at least one third of their directors elected by employees the white house did not respond to a request for comment on baldwin s bill which has the support of the afl cio related tax cut scorecard workers versus shareholderssince us companies have spent trillion to buy back their own stock according to birinyi associates between and companies in the s p devoted of their profits to stock buybacks according to research by university of massachusetts lowell professor william lazonick who advised baldwin s office on the legislation this was not good for the us economy said lazonick he called baldwin s proposed crackdown hugely positive even for long term shareholders who will benefit from companies investing in something instead of simply propping up the stock price but wall street and the business community would surely oppose federal legislation that handcuffs how companies can spend their profits defenders of buybacks argue that returning extra cash to shareholders is better than simply hoarding the cash in overseas bank accounts and buybacks have long played a key role in signaling financial strength even for washington this strikes me as incredibly stupid said jonathan macey a corporate law and finance professor at yale law school the idea that banning stock buybacks is going to help the economy ignores the fact that this money doesn t disappear it s returned to shareholders who can spend it macey said about of all families owned stocks directly or indirectly through retirement plans in according to the federal reserve however the rich own the vast majority of the stock market the top of households owned of all stocks in according to research from nyu professor edward wolff charles whitehead a cornell law school professor said that if companies aren t investing enough in the future that s a problem for corporate boards to solve not congress you re putting up an artificial barrier to try to block what is more of a fundamental systemic issue whitehead said related for most workers the tax cut windfall will disappearit s clear that trump s tax law which was pitched as a way to create jobs is playing a key role behind the buyback debate the white house estimates that million workers have received one time bonuses like the ones announced by comcast ccz disney dis and dozens of other major companies other companies like wells fargo wfc have raised wages for workers however companies are spending far more on buybacks than on improvements for employees analysts polled by morgan stanley expect that just of the corporate windfall from the tax cuts will go directly to workers while will go to shareholders baldwin called out kimberly clark kmb for repurchasing million worth of stock in and then announcing plans in january to slash up to jobs the maker of huggies and kleenex plans to shut factories including in two in baldwin s home state of wisconsin kimberly clark did not respond to a request for comment this exposes the false

annual meeting the so called woodstock of capitalism is always fun for loyal shareholders to attend in addition to the folksy wisdom dispensed by buffett and berkshire vice chairman charlie munger berkshire fans are treated to a movie often featuring celebrity cameos there s more a shopping pavilion features products from oriental trading and other berkshire subsidiaries a booth offers insurance quotes from berkshire s geico a k race is sponsored by brooks the berkshire owned running shoe company and there are plenty of dilly bars from dairy queen that too is part of the oracle of omaha s orbit if you aren t going to nebraska fear not yahoo finance will once again stream the festivities from the centurylink center on saturday and cnnmoney will cover the news as it happens here are six things to watch when buffett and munger hit the stage buffett will turn in august and munger celebrated his th birthday on new year s day that raises the question of who will one day follow the country s most celebrated investor buffett wrote in berkshire hathaway s annual shareholder letter that we now have the right person to succeed me as ceo a successor ready to assume the job the day after i die or step down but buffett has not named that person in january berkshire brkb named two top buffett lieutenants to the company s board greg abel ceo of berkshire hathaway energy company and ajit jain executive vice president of berkshire hathaway s national indemnity company insurance subsidiary related berkshire prepares for life after buffettpresumably that means that the person buffett was referring to three years ago is either abel or jain buffett or munger could give more hints on saturday but berkshire markets gurus ted weschler and todd combs will probably keep managing berkshire s investments in other words it may take more than one person to replace buffett even though most would argue that he s irreplaceable last year buffett called wells fargo s handling of the fake accounts scandal a huge huge huge error the bank s problems have only gotten worse since then some investors have argued that newish ceo tim sloan needs to step down buffett has stopped short of calling for major management changes but shares of wells fargo are down in the past year and rivals jpmorgan chase jpm citi c and morgan stanley ms are all sporting double digit percentage gains buffett can t be too pleased about that berkshire still owns more than million shares of the bank a stake buffett was a vocal supporter of hillary clinton for president but buffett acknowledged in this year s shareholder letter that billion of the billion gain in berkshire s net worth in was because of the republican backed corporate tax cut that president trump signed into law late last year but any lift that berkshire could get from lower corporate tax rates may be mitigated by trade scuffles with china the us china concerns are one reason the market has taken a hit lately related us and china kick off talks to avoid a trade warberkshire s stock is down about this year a little more than the s p that makes sense berkshire has a big investment in the chinese car company byd and many berkshire investments such as apple aapl gm gm and coca cola ko have a major presence there too a cartoon face of buffett was even featured on cherry coke cans in china last year so will buffett blast trump or china for the recent tariffs speaking of apple the iphone maker is now the biggest investment in the berkshire portfolio berkshire s stake in apple is worth more than its positions in wells fargo bank of america bac kraft heinz khc and coke and buffett just bought more he told cnbc that berkshire has added million shares on top of million at the end of last year it s an unbelievable company buffett said apple impressed investors this week with earnings that topped forecasts helping to allay fears about sluggish iphone sales but it s worth wondering whether buffett is too late to be backing apple after all berkshire had been a big investor in ibm ibm for years it has finally started to trim that stake as big blue s profit and sales growth has slowed related berkshire first bought an apple stake in buffett is famous for shunning a lot of tech because he likes to buy what he knows and is wary of paying too high a price for the stock still some would argue that berkshire would be better off owning google googl owner alphabet amazon amzn or facebook fb in addition to or maybe even instead of apple buffett noted in this year s shareholder letter that berkshire hathaway has billion in cash up from billion at the end of buffett has made it no secret that he wants to use some of that money to buy more companies this extraordinary liquidity earns only a pittance and is far beyond the level charlie and i wish berkshire to have buffett wrote our smiles will broaden when we have redeployed berkshire s excess funds into more productive assets related buffett loves coke but would he back a pepsi buyout so what could buffett buy he said in an interview with cnbc in february that he wouldn t rule out owning an entire airline berkshire hathaway already owns stakes in american aal delta dal southwest luv and united ual buffett is clearly itching to do something the last big deal berkshire made was the billion purchase of aircraft components manufacturer precision castparts in kraft heinz offered more than billion for consumer products giant unilever ul last year but unilever turned the bid down berkshire is often rumored to be considering other large food and consumer products giants such as general mills gis or kellogg k or oreo owner mondelez mdlz the possibility of buffett taking coke private even pops up from time to time too berkshire hathaway along with jpmorgan chase and amazon shocked the business world in january when the three giants announced plans to form a company that would help manage rising health care costs for their workers shares of the big health insurers drug store chains and pharmacy benefits management companies all plunged on the news that s because even though details are still scarce berkshire jpmorgan chase and amazon promised that the new company would be free of profitmaking incentives and constraints buffett said on cnbc in february that other companies have inundated him jpmorgan and amazon for details about how they could sign up for the yet to be named insurer related what merger mania means for health carebut buffett isn t promising miracles he noted in the cnbc interview that health care is enormously complicated but he added that we re determined we ve got the money we re going to stick with it so don t be surprised if berkshire shareholders and perhaps an employee or two asks buffett for more details about how he hopes to improve the us health care

standard cognition and zippin which have them up and running in san francisco a way to showcase ai driven checkout to retailers who may want to use it and to let passersby myself included stop in and shop these moves toward eliminating the checkout counter or at least flirting with ditching it come as consumers spend more and more money shopping online this year e commerce in the united states alone is estimated to climb to billion according to data from emarketer comprising nearly of all retail sales in the country customers also spend more time comparison shopping and reading about products online before heading to a store with a specific purchase in mind rather than browsing like we did before the rise of online shopping in response companies want to give shoppers more reasons to keep coming in and that increasingly means making the experience more convenient autonomous checkout is just the latest effort in order to eliminate or at least shorten lines stores are also trying everything from self checkout stations to smartphone apps like supermarket chain kroger s scan bag go some retailers such as apple even have tablet wielding employees that can ring you up at different parts of a store katherine cullen director of industry and consumer insights for the national retail federation expects that in the coming years large retailers in particular will invest in autonomous checkout systems the reason people come into the store is changing their expectations about convenience are changing and that s giving rise to a lot of the technology we re seeing she said cameras everywherethe companies building autonomous checkout systems are different but the technology they use is typically similar generally the stores rely on an app to check shoppers into the store along with a network of cameras that work with machine learning algorithms which have been trained on items that are in the store to figure out whether you re walking out with a can of pepsi or coke the stores also sell lots of packaged goods like canned or bottled drinks bags of candy or containers of yogurt which can be fairly simple to teach software to recognize unlike clothing on a hanger or individual pieces of fruit but the experience of shopping in the stores can be quite different when you walk into an amazon go store you must scan your phone to open a gate only then can you wander the aisles to buy boxed meal kits or a squat banana turmeric lassi on a recent trip to the open store in san francisco a second is under construction i spotted a number of employees that could assist me with questions or help me shoppers also filled the small space at standard cognition s store meanwhile there s nothing to stop you from entering the square foot location which opened on san francisco s market street at the end of august has cameras across its ceiling tracking shoppers in d space as they move from one camera view to another once inside you re supposed to hold out your phone facing upward so it can be scanned from above to check you in two employees were in there when i came in one of whom helped me with the check in process but it was otherwise quiet standard cognition cofounder and chief operating officer michael suswal said the company had been limiting visitors to up to five people at a time as its engineers work on making the software more certain about what it sees standard cognition plans to allow larger groups starting in december though stores with autonomous checkout are currently concentrated in a few urban tech heavy places like san francisco and amazon s hometown of seattle they re about to spread out standard cognition has a deal with paltac a japanese drugstore product distributor to bring its autonomous checkout to drugstores in japan this will roll out first with a drugstore chain called yakuodo suswal said and in tel aviv trigo vision has a deal with israeli supermarket chain shufersal to use its technology throughout the company s stores jenya beilin trigo vision s chief operating officer said shoppers in israel will be able to try it out within the next months humans and hurdleseven though ai is becoming increasingly capable in stores most companies i spoke with are confident that those who currently work as cashiers will still be needed maniar points to the rise of self checkout in stores like those of his former employer target as an example of what may happen if autonomous checkout becomes more common at first he said employees worried that their jobs would disappear but it was convenient for shoppers and employees took on other roles in the store and there are still many hurdles some technological some social that companies need to overcome to make autonomous checkout work well and to get and keep customers interested in shopping this way even with packaged goods it s hard to accurately track items people take and put back customers may also foil the system for instance at standard store i picked up two identical bags of chex mix at the same time with one hand admittedly an effort to trick the cameras and software and my receipt only included one of them when people try to steal something that s great suswal said once i told him what i d done he wasn t kidding either his company can take the video footage from my shopping trip and use it to train the company s ai system to better recognize theft although i might be fine getting a free bag of snacks i d be upset if standard store charged me for more than i d taken ed fox a professor of marketing at southern methodist university who studies consumer shopping behavior stresses the importance of getting this technology working consistently and repeatably because undoing mistakes will take a lot of time if you have an error rate of two or three or four percent that s unacceptable to a shopper he said cashier free checkout systems are also expensive beilin said it costs roughly to install trigo vision s system of cameras and other hardware in an square foot space plus a recurring fee and this could prevent or slow adoption by big box and members only warehouse stores eddie garcia vice president of end to end experience for warehouse store sam s club said that the economics are really tough for installing these kinds of systems in say a square foot warehouse space there are sam s club locations and they average to square feet in size the company recently opened up a tech testing store called sam s club now in dallas texas that has shoppers pay with their phones and use them to find products in the store there is no traditional cashier but it stops short of offering autonomous checkout that s not to say sam s club won t consider such technology though we ll go to where the customers take us in terms of their preferences garcia said and we ll be ready if that s where the puck goes correction a previous version of this story incorrectly stated the number of sam s club

product the ad was released as part of the company s my black is beautiful campaign a new p g ad for gillette this week comes from the same socially conscious playbook and asks men to take a look at their own toxic masculinity it s not unusual for p g advertisements to address social issues rather than plug products more companies may soon follow suit because customers want to see strong stands on politically charged topics like race immigration gay rights guns and the environment the woke business strategy will be big theme in as that s where the money is said scott galloway founder of the business research firm gartner l and a professor of marketing at new york university stern school of business p g is trying to position itself as a brand that can connect with younger consumers looking for companies that align with their beliefs p g is in business to sell products they re looking at what the long term reputation of the company is said andrew gilman ceo of commcore consulting the spot was a message to current and future employees about what the company stands for and expects from its workforce he added p g pg which acquired gillette in has a history of using unconventional advertising to emphasize the company s principles p g has also won praise for advertisements such as its always like a girl campaign that challenges stereotypes about young girls and women and pantene s strong is beautiful campaign that shows nfl players braiding their daughter s hair its deodorant brand secret showed a transgender woman in there s no wrong way to be a woman a narrator says in the ad important discussions can be tough discussions and we re not shying away from that said damon jones vice president of global communications and advocacy at p g is this the best a man can get in when gillette introduced its best a man can get slogan it ran an ad during the super bowl showing men playing sports at the office getting married and with their sons you re looking sharp you ve come so far father to son you re the champion gillette the best a man can get the anthem sings in the commercial p g s new ad we believe includes a voice narrating over scenes of bullying catcalls sexual harassment and masculinity is this the best a man can get the ad asks we can t hide from it its been going on far too long we cant laugh it off making the same old excuses then in a direct reference to the metoo movement the spot says something has finally changed it closes with scenes of men breaking up fights standing up for women and being attentive fathers bryan reber professor in crisis communication leadership at the university of georgia s grady college of journalism said that gillette was acknowledging its role in creating a problem gillette is implicitly saying we get it we re part of it that is the most unusual thing p g is not the only company that has recognized the benefit of putting a stake in the ground on controversial issues nike nke recently featured colin kaepernick in ads drawing on its own history of edgy advertising to stand out in the market in it launched an equality campaign featuring athletes like lebron james serena williams and gymnast gabby douglas one ad featured alicia keys singing sam cooke s a change is gonna come by making kaepernick a face of its th anniversary just do it campaign the company tried to earn support from its core customers young shoppers in big cities across the globe nike calculated that kaepernick s loyal following and popularity with star athletes would outlast boycotts and short term stock pressure nike s strategy paid off ceo mark parker told analysts in september that the ad resonated with consumers both in north america and around the world we ve seen record engagement with the brand as part of the campaign he said pepsi s blundergillette and nike s advertising have been successful because there are a clear links to the brands said reber who also heads the university of georgia s advertising and public relations department this type of advertising will become increasingly common he added other brands attempts to take stands with ads have come off as artificial such as pepsi s pep ad in with kendall jennar against the backdrop of the black lives matter movement pepsi was trying to project a global message of unity peace and understanding clearly we missed the mark and apologize the company said in a statement at the time ram trucks used a martin luther king jr speech in a super bowl commercial last year which was also widely panned for being artificial the risk for gillette is not immediate backlash on social media but what its ads will look like in the future and how it will use its slogan it will really hurt them if they don t walk the walk after making the promise reber said if they don t show through their future advertising that they get it then it s a problem,0.0547945205479452,0.037181996086105666,0.017612524461839533,0.009784735812133072,0.035225048923679066,0.003913894324853229,0.0136986301369863,0.033268101761252444,0.02935420743639922,0.08023483365949119,0.0136986301369863,0.011741682974559686,0.058708414872798424,2018-12-29,19524000000.0,10591000000.0,6854000000.0,19.0,0.08672835243750864,0.031211158679740367,0.05551719375776827,0.016572296644109932,0.05427427150946002,0.010633890346637205,0.02112967822124016,0.04792155779588455,0.03480182295263085,0.09045711918243336,0.017539013948349676,0.05026929982046679,0.06532246927219998,560,1925,225,529,2483,8170

to be an elaborate gesture it can be as simple as a rubber chicken or goofy wind up teeth just ask david novak the former ceo of yum brands credits much of his career success to his focus on employee appreciation recognition is the secret weapon to a business he says novak who worked his way through the ranks at pepsico and later led kfc and pizza hut to eventually become co founder and ceo of yum recalls one moment in his career that made him realize how important a simple thank you can be he had recently been promoted to chief operating officer at pepsi and was visiting a bottling facility he was sitting around a table with employees and everyone kept raving about their colleague bob and how instrumental he was novak glanced down the table and saw that bob was crying he was set to retire in two weeks and had no idea his coworkers felt this way that hit me in the gut novak remembered i said as a leader that the number one behavior i am going to show is appreciation and use it to inspire people i am going to make recognition my thing as a leader creating a culture of recognitionwhen novak was promoted to ceo of kfc in he got more condolence calls than those offering congratulations it was a graveyard for executives he said morale was down business was down it needed energy injected into the business that energy came from a rubber chicken novak started handing out the toys plus a small cash bonus to employees doing a good job and it worked this took off like you wouldn t believe it helped turned around the mindset of the organization and we started working together with the franchisees and turned around the quality in three years and the franchisees were now giving us ideas he recalled two years later he also became ceo of pizza hut he continued the tradition but this time he gave out foam cheese heads when you recognize people they will work harder people are starved for attention even if the attention is a plastic toy you can pick for a few bucks sometimes he would give out the awards spontaneously like when he saw an employee exemplifying the company s culture during one of his visits to a restaurant other times it would be planned so the recognition would occur during a meeting where he knew he d be able to honor an employee that had gone above and beyond expectations on each trinket he would write a personalized note about why the employee was receiving the accolade sometimes it was for quality food preparation other times it was for outstanding company service or leadership on project the award also came with a cash bonus which started at you have to be very specific with what the person has tangibly done and how it is contributing to the success of the organization it has to be purposeful as ceo of yum brands which operates taco bell kfc and pizza hutten novak was using the chattering teeth to reward employees and increased the cash bonuses to and the recognition culture was spreading his team leaders had started giving out their own recognition awards with their own personal touches the most effective recognition is something you like and have fun doing and tailoring it to the individual and tying it to the principle you want to see more of says novak yes his rewards were on the silly side but they were coveted novak recalled one employee who kept the award in a safe as the recognition culture spread employee turnover decreased at the company and it became easier to retain and recruit new hires the culture became a big part of why people wanted to come to our company novak said he always took a picture with award recipients which he later had framed he would then send one copy to the employee and kept the other novak covered his office walls with the pictures more than of them and when he ran out of room he hung them on the ceiling and in the hallways a legacy of appreciationduring novak s tenure yum s market capitalization increased from billion to around billion he retired in but the recognition culture he started is still a big part of the company david novak laid the foundation for yum s people first culture and strong focus on recognition which remains a key driver of our growth and values today said greg creed current ceo of yum in a statement to cnn his tremendous leadership continues to guide how we engage and develop our employees around the world to positively impact our customers shareholders and franchisees he still visits yum s headquarters in kentucky from time to time the awards still hang in the office and seeing them still makes him swell with pride i have a great office it symbolizes what our company is about and puts me in a great mood i feel privileged to be a leader one of the biggest reasons people leave their job is lack of appreciation but some leaders can be hesitant to dole out the accolades for fear of upsetting or alienating other employees novak says that s why you need to recognize employees often it only becomes a problem if you only recognize people once a year correction a previous version of this story incorrectly stated that yum brands headquarters is in tennessee yum is based in louisville

kinds of attacks could have given you an educated guess about what kind of person he was male probably in his s decent chance of at least a minor criminal record more than likely a history of hatred toward or violence against women oh and one more thing probably spent a fair amount of time on the internet people could easily become radicalized before social media many are still radicalized without it but social media often in combination with other factors has proven itself an efficient radicalizer in part because it allows for the easy formation of communities and in part because of its algorithms used to convince people to stay just a little longer watch one more video click one more thing generate a little more advertising revenue the recommendations that youtube provides for instance have been shown to push users toward extreme content someone who comes to the site to watch a video about something in the news could quickly find themselves seeing a conspiracy theory clip instead for instance in january youtube said it was taking steps to remedy this a few years ago someone looking for information about islam could soon find themselves listening to a radical preacher

attractive way for some of these men to express their rage and disappointment this is another ideology that is becoming very popular it s another fad for all the largely much deserved criticism they ve gotten recently over all the things they ve failed to act upon the social networks did step up and take real and impressive action when faced with a deluge of isis supporters and content the big tech companies could be taking similar action against white supremacists now the issue on mainstream sites is for the most part there s been an aggressive takedown of isis related content seamus hughes the deputy director of the program on extremism at george washington university said that same dynamic hasn t happened when it comes to white supremacy the companies could take action against white supremacists now indeed they could go on forever like that playing whac a mole with different movements that pop up and begin radicalizing their users moving against them after enough people have been killed it would be easier for them to do that than to actually deal with the underlying problem of those algorithms designed to keep people around it makes sense from a marketing perspective if you like pepsi then you re going to watch more pepsi videos but you take that to the logical extreme with white supremacy videos hughes said they re going to have to figure out how to not completely scrap a system that has brought them hundreds of millions of dollars of ad revenue while not also furthering someone s radicalization or recruitment perhaps the most disheartening aspect of this is that the companies have been told over and over again that they have a problem ben collins a reporter with nbc news tweeted friday extremism researchers and journalists including me warned the company in emails on the phone and to employees faces after the last terror attack that the next one would show signs of youtube radicalization again but the outcome would be worse i was literally scoffed at so what should the platforms do now asked that question bill braniff the director of the national consortium for the study of terrorism and responses to terrorism start and a professor of the practice at the university of maryland said what i believe we should be asking them to do is to continue to minimize the salience or the reach of violent extremist propaganda that calls for violence but not to limit themselves to just content takedowns as the way to do that what happens when large platform takes down this content or these views is that the content just shifts to smaller platforms maybe fewer people will be exposed over time and that s a good thing but that s not the same as a comprehensive solution content takedowns alone can both contribute to a persecution narrative and drive people to smaller more radical sites braniff noted and he thinks that means giving up an opportunity to use the algorithms to redirect rather than reinforce we know that people can actually be addressed through counseling and mentorship he said if instead of directing people who might be flirting with extremism to support if you censor them and remove them from these platforms you lose the ability to provide them with an off ramp while noting that platforms should still take down content that explicitly calls for violence which also violates their terms of service braniff said there s some content that doesn t violate the terms of use and so the question is can you make sure that information is contextualized with videos before and after it on the feed the comprehensive solution he sees is a change to the algorithms so that they could point people to differing views or even in some cases to support such as counseling algorithms can either foster groupthink and reinforcement or they can drive discussion he said right now the tailored content tends to be i think you re going to like more of the same and unfortunately that s an ideal scenario for not just violent extremism but polarization we re only sharing subsets of information and removing the middle ground the place where we come together to discuss different ideas a massive part of violent extremism is polarization and it s really

outages mismanagement and decades of under investment the country s oil output had already plunged to a year low prior to the us sanctions taking effect the international energy agency described it as the biggest drop in history for a sizable producer still chevron produced an average of barrels of oil and natural gas in the country during the first quarter of according to sec filings that s down from barrels during most of which was crude oil the operating environment in venezuela has been deteriorating for some time chevron warned in a may filing chevron said that future events could cause the environment in venezuela to become more challenged leading to increased business disruption and volatility in financial results venezuela represents a very small portion of chevron s overall production which rose to million barrels per day in the first quarter still leaving venezuela would cause a loss of earnings and likely lead the company to write down at least a portion of the value of its assets there in early halliburton took a million pre tax charge to write down the oil service company s entire remaining investment in venezuela we are continuing our limited operations in venezuela halliburton said in a recent sec filing and are evaluating our operations in advance of the july termination of the sanctions waiver halliburton declined to comment further on the matter

pdvsa that produced barrels per day of oil in the boscan field which is located in the state of zulia chevron also owns stakes in three other onshore production joint ventures two of which operate in venezuela s orinoco belt in addition to developing these projects chevron has put money back into the local communities in venezuela between and chevron said it invested more than million in areas it operates in venezuela as well as on national cultural programs those investments include a modern math and reading instruction program that supports teachers and nearly children in venezuela now chevron is mulling whether it will need to leave venezuela risk of nationalizationif the sanctions waivers aren t renewed and chevron leaves the hope is that the company would be able to resume its operations once relations between the united states and venezuela improve however analysts warn that would be no easy task venezuela s energy infrastructure is falling apart and a pause in activity would only worsen it if any foreign company came back in there would need to be an immediate and massive injection of capital just to bring things back to the levels of and said height capital s allen the big concern is that the maduro government will seize chevron s oil assets if the company decides to leave chevron would need to take writedowns help from international courts could take considerable time it ultimately might take a decade or two said jim rebello head of the energy m a practice at the consultancy duff phelps rebello said he worked at a predecessor to weatherford when the company s oil assets in iran were nationalized we had six drilling rigs in iran that we never got back he said chevron knows firsthand about that risk venezuela nationalized its oil industry in

has typically posted stronger growth in sales and operating profit than the beverage unit over the past few years the company has also expanded in africa recently on july pepsico agreed to buy south africa s pioneer foods group for billion hoping to gain a beachhead for expansion in the continent the us treasury department granted chevron cvx a three month extension of sanctions waivers that were scheduled to expire at midnight the decision gives chevron and four us oil services companies permission to continue doing business with national oil company pdvsa which has been sanctioned by the trump administration treasury provided no reason for granting the extension which expires october a retreat from venezuela would have dealt a financial and emotional blow to chevron which has spent nearly a century sinking resources into the nation venezuelan president nicolas maduro could have even seize chevron s assets by nationalizing them and a forced exit by chevron would have only deepened the historic decline of venezuela s oil industry which is already grappling with a humanitarian crisis infrastructure nightmares tough us sanctions and gross mismanagement our focus is operations in venezuela continue in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations chevron said in a statement on friday chevron said that its focus is on maintaining the safety of the operations and supporting the more than people who work with us as well as their families chevron one of the leading private oil companies in venezuela supports more than people in the crisis stricken country the company produced an average of barrels of oil and natural gas in venezuela during the first quarter the treasury department s extension also applies to four american oil services companies operating in venezuela halliburton hal schlumberger slb baker hughes bhge and weatherford international wftif the sanctions relief does little to solve the many problems facing foreign energy companies in venezuela pdvsa faces persistent cash shortages and repeatedly has had problems paying partners and suppliers the risks of working in venezuela far outweigh the potential benefits said pavel molchanov an energy analyst at raymond james there is nothing the us government can do to pdvsa that is anywhere near as destructive as what the maduro regime has already done by itself subdued oil prices could have given the trump administration extra leeway to crack down further on venezuela without fear of causing a spike in gasoline prices at home despite elevated tensions between the united states and iran oil prices have been under pressure from robust production from west texas the heart of the us shale oil boom earlier this week venezuelan opposition leader juan guaido pledged on twitter to protect chevron s assets in venezuela if us officials don t renew the license while washington and other western capitals have recognized guaido as venezuela s legitimate leader he has little power to enforce that pledge given that maduro remains in charge in january us president donald trump imposed punishing sanctions on pdvsa in an effort to force venezuelan president nicolas maduro from power those sanctions prohibited american companies from doing business with the national oil company exxonmobil xom and conocophillips cop left venezuela years ago following the nationalization of foreign run oilfields by former venezuelan president hugo chavez more recently pepsi wrote off its business in venezuela in and took a billion loss mondelez mdlz bridgestone brdcy colgate cl and kimberly clark kmb have also shut down their venezuela operations venezuela represents a very small chunk of chevron s total production which climbed to million barrels per day during the first quarter still leaving venezuela would cause a loss of earnings for chevron and likely force the company to write down at least a portion of the value of its assets

to increase the amount of recycled plastic they use in bottles they want to improve recycling infrastructure and ensure their packages are recyclable but the plastics industry association has ties to the american progressive bag alliance which encourages states to make plastic bans illegal participation in the association could tarnish coca cola and pepsi s images as companies working to find solutions to plastic pollution the association took positions that were not fully consistent with our commitments and goals coca cola said in a statement last week noting that it withdrew from the group earlier this year pepsi said it had joined the association to learn about innovation as it works to achieve a circular economy for plastics we do not participate in the policy advocacy work of the association or its subsidiaries and our membership will conclude at the end of this year pepsi said coke and pepsi made the wrong choice by being a part of the lobbying organization said dianna cohen ceo of the nonprofit plastic pollution coalition the optics of membership she added are really bad cutting ties with the plastic industry association is a sign that companies understand that they cannot publicly say they want to end plastic pollution while financially supporting an association that lobbies for our continued reliance on throwaway plastics said greenpeace usa oceans campaign director john hocevar in a statement the move may help reassure some customers but as people grow more worried about the negative impacts of plastic pollution on the environment as well as on animal and human health companies like pepsi and coke will have to go even further to find a solution tackling plastic pollutioncoca cola ko produced million tons of plastic in it disclosed in recent report by the ellen macarthur foundation pepsico pep did not disclose how much plastic it sells both companies are trying to figure out ways to reduce their use of virgin plastics and increase recycling they re also exploring alternatives to plastics like aluminum that are easier to recycle pepsico announced recently that its aquafina brand water will be sold in aluminum cans at us fast food and restaurant chains as soon as next year the company is testing out a broader rollout to retail stores tackling plastic waste is one of my top priorities and i take this challenge personally pepsico ceo ramon laguarta said at the time we are doing our part to address the issue head on by reducing recycling and reinventing our packaging pepsi has committed to using only recyclable compostable or biodegradable packaging by and it s pledged to make new plastic bottles using recycled material plus coca cola last year launched a world without waste initiative that encompasses its recycling goals which include collecting and recycling the equivalent of every bottle or can it sells by the company has also committed to making its bottles and cans out of at least recycled material in the next years still sticking to those goals will likely be difficult especially because recycling is struggling organizations like the world wildlife fund are helping companies try to achieve them the companies are also exploring refill stations that eliminate single use packaging altogether pepsi is selling a high tech water cooler that lets customers fill up their own bottles with flavored or unflavored still or carbonated water in varying temperatures coca cola has launched a similar product for dasani on college campuses leaving the lobbythose initiatives made membership in the plastics trade group problematic at least from a pr standpoint the plastics industry association is not only a lobbying group some of its initiatives like helping recycling may overlap with those of coke and pepsi our members work together to align their efforts to put recycling and sustainability at the forefront of their businesses said patty long interim president and ceo of the plastics industry association in a statement the plastics association says it does not itself lobby for legislation that bans plastic or hold an official position on those laws it says that it operate separately from the bag alliance and has different memberships and dues but a page on the association s website redirects to the bag alliance site and the contact email for the bag alliance has the same suffix as the association s an association representative declined to share how the groups are connected activists started pressuring coke pepsi and other companies to leave the plastic association last year the shareholder activist group as you sow and walden asset management called attention last year to corporate involvement with the plastic industry association and wrote letters to the ceos of coca cola and pepsico among others this year greenpeace also drew a line between the plastic industry association and anti plastic ban laws the plastics association said greenpeace is responsible for companies

than a month after the police killing of george floyd which ignited a nationwide racial reckoning that corporate america has been forced to address it took the washington football team less than two months to pull its racist former mascot off merchandise after retailers and corporate sponsors including target amazon and fed ex all but forced the team to change its logo in july ending decades of resistance from the nfl franchise yet most of the food brands problematic packaging can still be found on grocery store shelves today even though several of the companies have already begun rebranding their products what s taking so long allen adamson co founder of metaforce a new york based branding consulting firm suggests maintaining brand identity is both a priority and a problem for most of these companies each of their mascots adamson says has spent decades developing valuable name recognition which he estimates is worth millions of dollars the biggest challenge for these companies is that the only thing differentiating their brand from the store brand was aunt jemima or uncle ben adamson told cnn business when you take those characters away you re left with a commodity you pay less for a commodity than you do for a brand it s an expensive change and these companies paid a lot of money for these brand equities here s where each company stands with its brand overhaul aunt jemimait was the news of aunt jemima s eventual replacement that started a domino effect for racist brand names back in june the pancake mix and syrup brand owned by quaker foods and its parent company pepsico acknowledged jemima s roots in slavery and minstrel shows and committed to replacing her name and likeness with something less offensive without specifying when the change would take place jemima s image can still be found at grocery stores nationwide pepsi pep confirmed monday the beverage and food maker says the new logo and branding for aunt jemima will start hitting store shelves in october and will continue rolling out throughout the fourth quarter of pepsi says it s been working to come up with a jemima replacement that maintains the company s valuable brand recognition supply chain issues have delayed the process as well our consumers are still looking for the aunt jemima products they know and love especially during a time when we ve seen empty store shelves due to the pandemic joan cetera vice president of communications for pepsico foods north america told cnn business it will take time for the changes to fully move through our complex supply chain but consumers will see changes yet this year and early next year cream of wheatcream of wheat s parent company b g foods bgs announced last week that it will remove the black chef from its packaging beginning in the first quarter of the hot breakfast cereal brand initiated a review of the black chef on its packaging in june a day after aunt jemima made its rebrand announcement archived cream of wheat ads from the early th century indicate the original cream of wheat chef was named rastus a dimwitted former enslaved person portrayed in blackface minstrel shows during the same era for years cream of wheat has insisted its logo image was that of early th century chicago chef frank white while research indicates the black chef image may be based upon an actual chicago chef named frank white it reminds some consumers of earlier depictions they find offensive b g told cnn business therefore we are removing the chef image from all cream of wheat packaging mrs butterworthparent company conagra declined to say when it plans to unveil the new likeness of mrs butterworth whose famous humanoid bottle shape reminds some of an elderly woman of color when it s filled with brown maple syrup conagra cag initiated a review of its mrs butterworth packaging within hours of aunt jemima s rebrand announcement on june the company noted that it can see that our packaging may be interpreted in a way that is wholly inconsistent with our values at the time but acknowledged monday that same packaging is still available on grocery store shelves today our brand and packaging review is underway a conagra spokesperson said via email declining to comment further ben s original aka uncle ben sthe mars owned rice products brand formerly known as uncle ben s announced last week it is changing its name to ben s original the company s new packaging is expected hit grocery store shelves some time in mars marzf initiated a review of the black cook logo on its uncle ben s products in june hours after pepsico and aunt jemima did the same the uncle ben logo reflects how white southerners once used uncle and aunt rather than mr or mrs as honorifics for older black men and

business there s no place for anything in this world that hints at social injustice mars said its new ben s original name and packaging is still in development and replacing uncle ben s on store

that investors really do care about these climate goals and crave transparency about the carbon footprints of the companies they back that s especially true in the dirtiest sectors energy utilities and industrials while those three sectors make up less than of the s p s market value they account for a staggering of direct and indirect emissions according to bank of america and within those heavy

cautious approach preferring to focus instead on carbon capture technology neither exxonmobil xom nor chevron cvx the largest us oil companies have announced net zero goals it s easier to justify
